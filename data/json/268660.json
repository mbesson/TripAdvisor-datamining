This happened two nights in a row. The disney hotel was hopping so we slipped in over there. We had 2 beautiful rooms, private safe lagoon with sea turtles that swam with you and a monk seal posing for pictures that made our trip relaxing and exciting at the same time. Our daughers who are 17 and 21 could not believe what a great time they had from skydiving to jumping off the rock formations in the North Shore.

Husband used fitness facility once and said was better than most with 6 treadmills and other equipment, Tennis courts also avail. but not used. Pool side food and drinks reasonably priced. Pool not overcrowded like the Disney resort seemed to be. Didnt eat at the restaurants but def would not recommend the hawaiian bbq available across the road at the local stores. Taco place was ok and reasonable price. Check out the weekend special for car rental at Hertz (on site) if you didnt rent a car already.

The room was great with a huge bathroom, separate shower and tub, toilet separated by a door. We had more than enough space and the balcony also had a sitting area with couch. The hotel is next door to the Disney resort but wasn't a bother because I think most families stayed in the pool area there, however, that's not to say there wasn't a lot going on. Great walking paths around the lagoon and the additional three that connect to it. There was not a lot to choose from as far as restaurants in the near area of the hotel so mainly stayed at the resort. The food was good, breakfast was the usual buffet, we did the healthy start for $18 a piece each day. My only gripe would be the seafood buffet on Saturday night for $50 each. This was ok, however, when we got up for breakfast the next morning at the same restaurant it was like looking at leftovers from the night before (even the dessert was out). Probably something a lot of restaurants do but it couldn't have been more obvious and it was going for 5 bucks cheaper... Just not my cup of tea.

Although it's a great place for kids and families, it doesn't feel chaotic whatsoever. The Ihilani Resort is located 20 miles west of Honolulu in the recently developed Ko'Olina Resort area. Although most Oahu tourists stay in the Waikiki area because of its reputation and central location, I feel that the Ihilani (and other Ko'Olina resorts) offer a more relaxed environment away from the chaos. Some may be weary of its location, but the hotel is actually conveniently located to almost everything you need. The hotel is near a private beach, across the street from a shopping plaza that has a local grocery store (that doesn't rip you off), has a spa on site, and a golf course nearby. It is also located next to the Paradise Cove Luau, which is another place worth visiting if you want to experience a typical Hawaiian luau. And as long as you don't travel during the weekday work rush hours, traveling into Honolulu is only 30 minutes away. I feel it's definitely a better value for what you pay for as opposed to staying in Waikiki where all the prices are hiked up for hotels that are much lower quality. The hotel itself is very classy and clean. The grounds are beautiful filled with ponds that house a variety of animals including sting rays and baby hammer head sharks. The room we had was modernized and quite spacious. Even though we were on the 4th floor, we still got a great view of the ocean. I also suggest getting a room with a lanai so you can enjoy the sunrise/sunset from the comfort of your room. There's some renovation going on throughout the property, but I believe most of the rooms have already been renovated. One key factor to note is that the beach located right outside of the hotel is very clean and not as crowded as other public beaches throughout the island. The beach is actually 1 of 4 man-made lagoons in the Ko'Olina area (Lagoon #1). Although all of the lagoons are open to the public, there is only one major parking lot for beach-goers located near lagoon #4. Therefore, the majority of the public goes to Lagoons 3 and 4. Thus, with the Ihilani being located near lagoon #1 (shared with the Disney Aulani Resort next door), the majority of the people at the beach are fellow hotel guests from one of the two resorts. In addition, you are also able to rent kayaks, paddle boards, and snorkel gear nearby if you want to enjoy some activities as well. I know that the term \"man-made\" may sound like a turn-off for some, but it really doesn't feel man-made at all. You get an authentic beach experience similar to any other beach you are looking to visit in Waikiki. It's not a bad thing, especially if you have kids because you have the piece of mind that the beach is safe and less dangerous than other areas around the island. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to go golfing or visit the spa, but the golf course is within close proximity and the spa is on site. The restaurant is a great place for breakfast (they are known for their malasadas or aka \"Portuguese donuts\"). However, there is a small shopping plaza conveniently located across the street with an ABC Country Market and a couple of restaurants. The ABC Market actually reminds me of a mini grocery store that also sells sundries and Hawaiian gifts to take back with you. Amazingly, the ABC Market does not hike up its prices even though its the only market in the Ko'Olina resort area. I know the prices may seem unreasonable, but cost of living is high everywhere you go in the island because of the shipping costs that get passed to the consumers/residents. I usually don't give 5's across the board, but this hotel exceeded my expectations. Being a Starwood loyalist, I usually hesitate when I have to venture outside of the Starwood family. However, the service was great, the atmosphere was outstanding, and I feel I got great value for what I paid for. I highly recommend this place to any travelers looking for a relaxing resort-like experience. I do have one suggestion to management. The beach area does feel segregated between the Ihilani guests and Aulani guests. The segregation is not so much of a problem, but it does seem like the Aulani guests are the \"have's\" and the Ihilani guests are the \"have-not's\" when it comes to the cabanas and beach chair setups. I know the Disney Aulani resort is a new resort, but Disney does make it a point to make their guests feel \"elite\" even on the public lagoon. I suggest upgrading your cabanas and beach chairs and maybe even adding more to the beach. When you are in the ocean and look towards the hotels, the \"Ihilani side of the beach\" seems sparse compared to the \"Disney Aulani side of the beach.\" Don't sell yourself short or make your guests feel like they are getting a \"lesser experience\" than the guests next door. The Ihilani Hotel is actually much more classy and it should feel that way even on the beach. It's not a big issue, but I do worry that guests will start comparing the Ihilani to the Disney Aulani Resort next door and that would be unfair because the Disney resort is the new shiny object, but does not really hold up to the Ihilani when you take a closer look.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hingham, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel in a quiet area\u201d", "Author": "Robin T", "ReviewID": "UR137648542", "Content": "Just what you would expect from a JW Marriott: beautiful hotel, excellent service, high (but not unreasonable) prices.

Just like many others have stated on their reviews, the room and bathroom was huge for a standard room. I am a very picky person when it comes to where I stay, and I was so well pleased with it. Everyone we encountered at our stay was just awesome. The moment we checked in we were greeted by a traditional Hawaiian aloha by the valet and it never stopped. We had a great experienced checking in and was even offered an upgrade by a sweet man whose name I think was Jason. He let us look at the each room before we picked the room we wanted. I must also mentioned all those complaints about noise from the Disney resort is insane. We never could hear anything. We even walked in front of that resort and still couldn't hear noise. The lagoon area was great and was never full. The only drawback to staying at this resort is the traffic to deal with when wanting to go to Wakiki. I am from Dallas, so i really did not want to fight traffic on my vacation. Lol.... However, to rebuke that one complaint i must mention it seems to be closer to the North Shore then driving it from Wakiki. So it really is a trade off for us since we go to both of them while visiting Oahu. Honestly, I could keep going on and on about all the great things this resort has to offer.

The room also had screen slider, wooden shutters, and glass slider for three options. the beaches/coves are so clean and beautifully landscaped, with truly GORGEOUS views. we saw fish and sea turtles with our snorkeling equipment (destined for Maui after visiting Pearl Harbor).

As you enter the hotel there is a revolving door with a really cool sculpture in the middle. Then as you leave the lobby there are the pools of fish, manta rays, and sharks. The hotel room was BEAUTIFUL and like all the other reviews the bathroom is HUGE. There was a sink on either side of the bathroom. There was a shower and then a bathtub beside it. The shower was pretty big with a shelf you could sit on. Lol, I don\u2019t think that I have seen a sewing kit in a bathroom in forever. They had one in the Ihilani bathroom. The lanai was HUGE as well. As you enter the lanai. Ours had a table and 2 chairs to the left and a couch to the right. There was room for another table as well. Very spacious. The couch was huge, You could probably fit 4 maybe 5 people on it. The cushions were quite comfy as well. We got an ocean view room and WOW the view was breathtaking. I would LOVE to wake up to that view every morning. The lagoon was awesome. You share it with the Aulani and the Marriot Vacation Villas or something but there is a TON of space and even though there were lots of people, there was room for everyone and you didn\u2019t feel crowded. If you head into deeper water, there is a man made reef where you will find lots of fish and turtles. The first day we went, the water was calm and perfect for snorkeling. The second day the water was more rocky and therefore it was hard to see the fish. On top of the that, the sand was soft and not full of rocks that will hurt your feet like the rocks at the beach in Waikiki. The pool was okay. On the small side, you aren\u2019t going to get much exercise swimming from 1 end to the other. The 2 containers of water with pineapple and grapefruit was always full and nice and cold. The only other downside was that we were a group of 2 adults and 2 children and they gave us a room with a king bed. So we had to request a rollaway which was a twin side, so still 1 child still had to sleep in the bed with us. I really would have liked to have a room with 2 beds but oh well.

The lanai was large and private, overlooking the lagoon and giving us a wonderful view of the ocean. The fruit boat with warm banana bread at Naupaka Terrace is delicious! We ate burgers for lunch at the Poolside Bar and Grill, and it was decent, and sushi for dinner at Ushio-Tei. While there, we had a fabulous time at the spa and we participated in some of the many on-site activities.

We had to check out the new Aulani Resort, and I must say that Disney has once again done a fabulous job and it is certainly a destination for a family with young children. While some reviews complained about the noise, it wasn't an issue for us, and the only noise we heard was from the neighboring luau close to the finale. If you are going to Ko'Olina, keep in mind that it is a self-contained resort area removed from the city.

We chose the Ihilani because Waikiki doesn't appeal to us, and we wanted to take a peek at the Disney Aulani resort next door. The Ihilani resort was quiet and beautiful, with huge, well-appointed rooms. We were bumped up to an ocean view without being charged because the front desk clerk originally put us in a room that we THINK was already occupied. For some reason, the dead bolt was on the door, so we returned to the front desk and were moved to a better room. We had a chance to stroll the grounds and sit by the lagoon for a bit, and found everything to be beautiful. It's clear the Disney resort next door kind of overwhelms what must have once been a quiet, isolated Ihilani experience. It wasn't really that way any more. Lots of action through the day in the lagoon that is shared with Disney, and lots of noise coming from next door, too! Still, the Ihilani delivered a 5 star experience. The reason we only give it a four-grade is that Ko Olina itself was pretty - well - lame. If you want to eat there, the choices are extremely limited... Pretty much just the expensive hotel offerings. The tiny shopping center across the street is half-empty, with nothing for tourists but an ABC Convenience store, a taco place and an ice cream shop. There is also apparently a Roy's Restaurant on the property, but that's it. Shopping is non-existent.

The first time was with just me and my husband, and this last time was with our teenage boys. We stayed here for 3 nights after 5 nights in Waikiki. The bustling Waikiki experience I think is a must for all teens...but a perfect compromise is ending the trip here. A lot has been made of the noise from the Disney resort Aulani next door and I was a bit apprehensive about it because when I stayed here previously it was so peaceful and relaxing. However, I didn't find there to be much of any difference. Yes you can hear some of the festivities from the resort in the afternoon - sing alongs and cheering, etc. But it wasn't excessive and most importantly at nighttime it was as quiet and romantic as ever. The cove is now shared with the Aulani resort, but it doesn't affect availability of any lounge chairs and I felt the swimming/snorkeling was as good as ever. The hotel itself is kept spotlessly clean, and all of the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our last visit was 7 years ago and with this visit we saw no compromise in quality or wear and tear. Our rooms both had a gorgeous lanai, along with the view they were spacious and had a chaise lounge along with two chairs and a table. Beds are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms are a dream! The grounds are gorgeous, there are stingrays and hammerhead sharks along with koi that swim around throughout the property. I recommend asking when feeding time is and trying to be there, it's great fun to take pictures. The only negative I can say about this property is the pool. It's kind of small and shallow all the way around. It's definitely pretty and the pool bar is awesome - the bartenders are the best and will take good care of you. The food offered poolside is better than most places. But, there's no denying that the pool area as a whole is kind of \"eh...\" However, you have the gorgeous ocean and beach right there in front of it so all things considered it's not that important. The location is a drive from everything, I would definitely recommend a rental car.

We arrived after four days in Waikiki because we wanted to end our trip on a calmer quieter note and we got it! It was a very calm and comfortable atmosphere, where the staff was pleasant and willing to assist whenever we needed. We had no issues with noise from Aulani or from room neighbors. Yes, Aulani was a bit loud in the afternoons for a short time, but so what! The beach was great, sand and easy in and out. There was plenty of seating at the beach and pool. We ate dinner at Azul one night, Naupaka Terrace for breakfast each morning and pool service for lunch and drinks. All gave good food and service and they were a better value than I expected we would find at the hotel. There are only a few options for eating on property, but several more close by. We LOVED Roy's which was a short shuttle ride away. The room was very spacious and well maintained. The bed and linens were very comfortable and as I said, no noise from the rooms next door to speak of! :) The lanai was spacious with a chaise, a t able and two chairs. We had a lovely view. The bathroom set up was perfect for two friends traveling together as we did not want to invade the others space, but we had to get ready at the same time. It also allowed us to get up during the night to go to the restroom without disturbing the other person. We went for a massage at the spa and it was wonderful. The spa is a very comfortable and well equipped space. It was a great massage! My ONLY real complaint is the lack of a shuttle to and from the airport. We spent $100 getting from Waiki to Ihilani and another $100 getting to the airport. I guess maybe we should have rented a car, but who wants to drive on those crazy highways? NOT US!

Ihilani is where the locals go for a staycation (this we learned from multiple locals we encountered at the hotel who were from the Honolulu area and were looking to get away). It is away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu and is the place to go if you are looking for a relaxing trip. We had booked a King mountain view, but when we checked in they didn't have any available so they offered us a king suite or double ocean view. We went for the ocean view, and I couldn't have been happier!! The room was amazing! There standing shower and separate tub, and 2 sinks with mirrors. The toilet was in a little room by itself, so you could continue to get ready in the morning or go to the bathroom without disturbing anyone else. All of the lights are controlled through the phone interface, as well as the Do Not Disturb for the maids, which was a great touch. There is also a large desk if you need the space. Both double beds were extremely comfortable, but we slept in 1 together, which was big enough for the both of us. The lanai was amazing. It overlooked the private cove and pool below and was wonderful to have the doors open to hear the ocean outside. There is a lounge chair outside, as well as a small table with 2 chairs if you want to enjoy coffee in the morning or a snack later on. We had no problems with privacy and were very comfortable in our room. I was a little unhappy with the lack of dining choices available on site, but we weren't at the hotel that often so it wasn't really a big deal. The terrace that they have the breakfast buffet is really expensive. We never had the buffet, but did order off the menu, and the food was pretty good, but there weren't any other cheaper or faster options at the resort. The bar at the pool serves lunch, which we had one day and it was really, really good, and a bit cheaper than the terrace, although it still had resort prices. I would recommend eating there if you have a chance! The last day we were at Ihilani we saw the small coffee shop in the corner of the lobby that seems hidden behind the concierge desk. They offer coffee, pastries, snacks, and fruit at pretty reasonable prices, and I wish we would have known about them sooner so that we could have utilized the on-the-go coffee bar more! Our room did not have any information about on site restaurants or their hours, so it was pretty much a guessing game as to what type of food was offered, when there were open, and when they were located. The first night we were in Oahu we had drinks and dinner at the Lounge at Ihilani because everything else was closed. The bartenders were wonderful and the whole bar had a Casablanca feel to it, with the open windows and ceiling fans. My husband and I both had a burger and they were hands down the best burgers we had ever had. Definitely try the bar food! We also never saw any vending machines on the floors, so I'm not sure if they have any. That was a little inconvenient, but we managed. The cove is absolutely beautiful and great for snorkeling. The waters are very calm and it's a large enough area that you don't feel as though you're on the beach with 400 other people. We enjoyed the time we spent down there and loved being so close to it. Aulani is the next resort over, but I never heard much of a ruckus from the resort. We walked over to see it (it's impressive!), but their guests didn't seem intrusive on the cove or with noise. The hotel is a short walk to Paradise Cove for a luau, which is really convenient and fun! Parking was $35 a day, self or valet, so we always did valet. Parking price was way, way to high, but it's Oahu, so what can you do?

We read Trip Advisor reviews for months as we booked our trip and up until the date we left. Let me be the first to tell you that any complaints people have written about this hotel are just absurd! This was a beautiful hotel that set the perfect mood for a romantic getaway for two! Take advantage of local snorkeling tours, surf lessons, and luaus. There is so much to do right in the area and shuttle services are provided by each of the companies as well. Here are 10 thoughts I wanted to share with everyone to give back for the awesome advice we used before our trip. Hope you find it helpful! 1. Upon arrival we were given a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe ocean view room (much appreciated after being up for almost 24 hours) because we are platinum members. 2. Staff was super wonderful from the moment we arrived. The person who brought us our room service the night we got in was so chatty I thought we could share a drink on the balcony like girlfriends :) 3. The pool area is small but perfect for a lazy afternoon lying around poolside (anyone disappointed and looking for waterslides and multiple pools should have booked at Disney). Who wants to sit at the pool all day in Hawaii anyway? Lounge chairs are not hard to come by, they're very comfortable for an afternoon nap. 4. Restaurants were great at the hotel, yes a little pricey (not obnoxious) but excuse me, you're in Hawaii, we expected this. Don't hesitate to walk down the beach sidewalk and check out all the other hotel restaurants. We ate at the Marriott Beach Club \"Longboards\" place twice and Disney once. 5. Careful when going to Azul. The food menu prices aren't bad, but a GLASS of wine starts at about $25 (ask for Stuart, he's a welcome breath of humor in an otherwise stuffy environment and called me, \"The Lady\" multiple times making me feel more important than I actually am!) 6. I expected the Disney resport next door to be painted in neon colors, with strobe lights, and obnoxious children's music to be blasting through speakers at all times. NOT AT ALL. The resort actually blends in with the island better than the JW and is super calm. You can't even tell what's going on inside unless you actually are inside. Don't let other reviewers scare you. We went in for lunch on our last day, and as two 20-somethings, we couldn't believe the fun going on around us! Mickey and Goofy were dancing in the water with kids while parents frantically snapped pictures. Kids were screaming going down the bajillion water slides they have and the food was actually decently priced and really good! We vow to take our own future children here someday instead of Disney World! Once we walked out, we couldn't hear a thing from the outside. Everyone needs to ease up on Disney :) 7. Warning to anyone staying on the other side of the hotel that does not face Disney. We had the most AMAZING view from the 16th floor and kept our balcony open to hear the waves crashing every night. However, there were wedding receptions happening almost every night that played music loud enough for us to sing along with the lyrics and have our own dance party in the room. We didn't complain because the view was too amazing. Besides, what will they do? Ask the reception to stop? Music was done by 10:00ish each night so it didn't bother us. If you're someone who would get annoyed by this though, stay on the Disney side of the hotel. 8. Do the Paradise Cove luau. We've done one in Maui a couple of years ago and it was on the smaller side. This was about 900 people and yet, very intimate. There are many opportunities to talk with people seated around you and the food was good! There are lots of things to do ahead of time, so be sure and get there early. PLUS, as soon as you arrive someone writes your name down at a table to reserve your table spot. You go and play games and are assured your seats are saved. So worth it! (P.S. Although the cheapest package has you sitting on the sides of the stage, we had an excellent view of everything. Don't let them get you to pay the extra $30 a person for nothing!) 9. Check out the taco restaurant across the street from the JW. It's only about a 5 minute walk. It's near an ABC store too! I thought it would be a junky fast food joint and it was a cool, sit down relaxed atmosphere with reasonably priced mexican food. We ate outside and it was a nice change of pace! 10. Ko Olina offered a nice \"resort\" feeling. We were back and forth about staying at the JW or at the Marriott downtown in Waikiki. Turns out we made a GREAT choice with Ko Olina. We ventured to Waikiki once and it was pretty sketchy. There were homeless people all up and down the beach and on the sidewalks. Not the tropical Hawaiian vacation we had imagined. We left within a half hour and sighed with relief about our choice to stay in Ko Olina. If you're into big city atmospheres, Waikiki would be the place for you! We had the most wonderful trip to Oahu and had high standards following a Maui trip two years ago. Marriott doesn't disappoint and really treated us well (and they should considering how many nights my husband has stayed with them.)

The view of the ocean, Waianae mountains and sunsets were spectacular! Our dining experience at the Naupaka Terrace and Ushio Tei was outstanding. Because of our busy schedule during the day, we ended up having late dinners and arrived at the restaurants right when they were closing. Despite our late arrival, both of these restaurants served us with excellence and we didn\u2019t feel rushed at all. Each night the food was amazing! I am a vegan and the Naupaka Terrance created/modified entrees for my special dietary needs. The poolside wait staff was great, as was the food. Although I only had time for a pedicure at the spa, I felt like I was pampered and treated like a queen during my spa experience. I hope to experience some other spa treatments in the future.

The hotel is right next to the new DIsney property which actually adds to the atmosphere and if you have kids, take them there as it is pretty incredible and there is so much more for them to do and enjoy with more pools and activities. The JW's hotel grounds are amazing and the rooms are very nice and are going to be renovated in September so it will be even nicer. The pool is nice but there is only one pool and it is not large, however the frozen grapes are a great touch. The beach area is amazing to do paddle boarding, snokeling, or just have fun in the ocean water and relax in the sun and Hawaiian breeze. We had a room with a balcony on the 7th floor whcih was high enough to see over the palm trees and watch inclredible sunsets from our balcony, quite romantic. Floors lower than the 7th might not get such a great view. At night, we left the balcony door open and enjoyed the sound of the ocean waves and breeze drift us into peaceful sleep. We had lunch at the pool bar and dinner at the Italian restaurant which were very good and reasonable! Our first night, we even ordered room service as we drank our wine and had them bring up a pizza which put a smile on both our faces. I would recommend stopping at Costco on the way to the hotel (not far away) and pick up some things you can keep in the small fridge. The hotel boutique even had some great dresses for my sweetheart at a nice price along with alot of other items which was a great convenience. The only negative was when we needed to get bottles of water late one night and the store was closed so we had to go the bar and it was $7 or $8 a bottle. Bring your own or get it from the store before it closes. I would highly recommend and look forward to going back again, loved it, loved it, loved it.

The hotel room itself was very nice although other parts of the hotel seem a little tired (eg the pool and elevators). However, there were some big concerns: 1. Upon check in our name was mispelled in the system which created a lot of anxiety when we were told that our reservation didn't show up. Then there was only a minimal apology once it was found. We did not feel welcomed, especially compared to the Westin Moana Surfrider we stayed in the previous night. 2. The biggest concern was the balcony area of our room. Only the top left part of the balcony looked out at all, while a roof completely blocked the majority of our view (442). Because the roof came down to the edge of our balcony, newspapers that blew off the balconies above collected at the base of ours. Finally, and I realize this may be unavoidable, everyday we found a large dead cockroach in front of the sliding door (I kicked them to the side and have pictures). Since our 2 year old sleeps early we had hoped to spend time on the balcony after she went down. However, there was no light and the view made me feel trapped. I don't expect a glorious ocean view if I am not paying for it but a mountain or garden view should look at a mountain or garden, never a roof. 3. Also, with a two year old we had to spend time in the room every afternoon for her nap. Everyday there was construction noise outside that made it hard to sleep. I think it was from the parking lot. Most rooms in the hotel opened to an inside hall but ours was a long walk from the elevators and opened to the outside, making it much noisier than other rooms. 4. Finally, the pool was not at all useful for a family with a toddler. There were no shallow parts and no kids pool which made it unusable for us. I guess I should have looked into this in advance but, after staying at the Westin Ocean Villas in Kauai twice, I expected more out of a Hawaiian resort. All in all, I was disappointed. I would definitely not recommend the hotel for families with small children. I thought the beach would be good since it was protected from waves but by the afternoon the water would get visibly dirty, presumably from all the people in the water.

The beach you see next to the hotel is pretty well maintained, just look too artificial. Too really see fish if you want to snorkel, you have to go out farther to the rock barrier which is pretty deep and a good distance to swim. The clarity of the water for snorkeling is not that great. For a place that is isolated from other areas and attractions, with the public transportation or shuttle service to any major attactions, it would appear that the rate for parking would be more reasonable.

To try to get some of the Neighbor Island peace and relaxation, we decided to split our time between Waikiki (Moana Surfrider) and the JW Marriott on the west side of O'ahu...and we were glad we did! The grounds were lovely, much like the hotels we love on the Neighbor Islands...fragrant and filled with koi ponds (the baby hammerhead sharks and rays were especially amazing). Our room was fantastic--overlooking the pool and lagoon, with a fantastic sunset view. It was HUGE (i was skateboarding around with room!) with a supremely comfortable bed, amazing marble bathroom, and a fantastic balcony complete with cozy couch! The breakfast buffet was GREAT, the poolside bar featured friendly staff and good drinks. Okay; now for the reason I didn't give this resort five stars: Firstly, the fish (lunch/dinner) was frankly--awful. When I go to the islands I pretty much live on seafood for lunch and dinner, particularly ahi poke. The first time I got a \"fresh fish sandwich\" (mahi mahi perhaps?) which was quite badly fragrant, if you know what I mean, but at least edible. But the second day, the ahi poke was gamey, smelly, and the color of a bruise, instead of the rich red color I am used to. I didn't want to be a jerk and send back my food, but nor was I pleased. The next is the Disney resort next to the JW Marriott. I know, I know...not the fault of the JW Marriott, but perhaps they could do something about the loudness of the Disney ceremonies at night, the screaming children from the Disney resort invading the peace of the Marriott's pool, and the rudeness of the Disney employees asking every second where you are staying when you are swimming at the lagoon that the JW Marriott supposedly SHARES. My partner and I are eclectic-looking individuals and we got sneered at constantly by Disney families, who prompted the Disney employees to inquire as to our room number at the Marriott (What happened to privacy?! The JW Marriott isn't even their \"jurisdiction\"!) when they weren't satisfied with our merely stating that we were staying there. To avoid fuss, we complied...but again, we weren't happy. In conclusion, except for the (served) fish, the JW Marriott is a lovely resort and a great place to stay if you are looking for a Neighbor Island experience while on O'ahu. I would definitely come back to the JW Marriott the next time we go to O'ahu, but if you, like us, are more \"artistic\" types, I would ask the staff in advance what to say if you are \"treated\" to a \"security interrogation\" by the Mickey Mouse Club!!!!", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Rosa, California", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous setting, inviting water\u201d", "Author": "Susan M", "ReviewID": "UR129146371", "Content": "My husband and I spent a week at the Ihilani this past March, and we enjoyed the place immensely.

We are a couple of 20-somethings that love to relax but love adventure as well. It was away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but still located in a place where we could reach everywhere on the island. Some of our best days were when we drove around the island and just stopped at different locations to explore. The place you decide to sleep is a very small part of your experience in Hawaii. Okay, back to the resort... when we arrived at the hotel, we received a complimentary bottle of champagne (which we thoroughly enjoyed). That is an important fact because we love champagne. Rooms - We had reserved a mountain view room for 5 nights but when we arrived at the hotel we decided to upgrade to an ocean view for $250.00 ($50.00/night). It was WELL worth it. Every night we tried to watch the sunset on our impressive Lanai. Our entire west-facing wall was glass sliding doors and the rooms were well furnished. My wife liked the large bathroom with large mirrors. We had a 42-inch tv in our room as well as digital remote control to control the lights/tv/etc. These were all nice touches. We are loyal Marriott customers and have stayed at several of their hotels. Marriott hotels can sometimes have major faults and shortcomings, but this hotel seemed to be well managed and the rooms were very comfortable. Restaurants - We LOVED the buffet at the restaurant. It was about $25.00 a person but it was well worth it. We tried something new everyday and it was never busy or crowded. When we decided to eat at the buffet, we always left full and satisfied. We also ate dinner at their main restaurant as well and were always satisfied with the food/drink. One time at dinner, I even accidentally dropped a knife on a shark. The shark didn't seem to mind as it just swam away. I apologize for the inconvenience. Grounds - People, it is Hawaii, you should really spend your time discovering the Island. If you decide to stay on the resort for a day you won't be disappointed. We spent one day laying by the pool and one day by the cove. Both days were a great experience. The servers were attentive and available when needed (which was often). We went snorkeling and saw some pretty cool stuff in the cove, I would recommend trying that out if it's still free. The pool is a little small but I was more concerned with getting tan and getting drinks than I was swimming. Overall - My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the JW Marriott in Oahu. We liked that it was away from the busy parts of Honolulu. We spent a day in Waikiki and loved it, but liked the more relaxed atmosphere of Ko' Olina. The cove was a little busy at times but to be honest we were on our Honeymoon and were more obsessed with each other than we were the resort. Seriously, we were in Hawaii, we weren't going to complain. It is a little pricey, but I feel that it is worth it considering the relaxing atmosphere and the impressive grounds. My advice (and seriously, it isn't worth much) is to give it a shot. Especially if you are planning on staying here a couple nights and staying on the North Shore or in Waikiki a couple nights.

Overall the resort is beautiful with the saltwater lagoons adding a nice touch and the restaurant staff and bellman was very helpful with directions and restaurant suggestions. Restaurants in the hotel were expensive but we expected that so we decided to just do breakfast and lunch in the resort and visited nice restaurants outside the resort for dinner. 2 places I will recommend( and I will write reviews later) is Roy's Ko Olina which is at the Ko Olina beach club and there is a hotel shuttle that wil take you there. Also visit the Hula Grill at the Outrigger at the beach in Waikiki for dinner. Back to this resort review, the only negative is that there is no natural beach with waves that you can access. My son loves the ocean and it's waves and even though the lagoon was right outside the resort and great for kids, there are no waves like a real ocean and we missed that. The pool was good not great, we have been to other Marriott sorts which have bigger pools with waterfalls and slides but this one was just a basic round pool so I was disappointed with the pool area. The Ko Olina area is definitely more private than the crowded Waikiki area so if you are looking for a peaceful,relaxing vacation in Oahu then Ko Olina is a great choice. we did drive to the North Shore and that felt like the real Hawaii with the natural beaches and big waves and we stopped ate some local fruit stands and bough fresh cut up fruit and had fresh cooked shrimp from Fumi's shrimp truck which was awesome. Thanks to Sean from Marriott Vacation Club for telling us to do the North Shore drive and he was kind enough to tell us which beaches to stop at, which shrimp truck to eat from and the local fruit stands etc. Overall our trip to Jw Marriott Ko Olina was wonderful but please consider the lack of a natural beach if that is your priority.", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grapevine, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLovely resort but needs some TLC\u201d", "Author": "FoodiesAnonymous", "ReviewID": "UR127835386", "Content": "Went here last week to surprise our friend who was celebrating his 50th birthday- that said, we would have been happy anywhere, so that rather colors my review.

(Before Disney) Our room must have been recently redecorated as it was very spacious and pleasantly appointed, more like a condo than a normal hotel room. Only issue was that our balcony was a pigeon haven and they were constantly perched on the railing and making a mess of things. One thing I was very impressed with was the service at this hotel. About 2 weeks- 10 days out I began to receive personalised emails offering various services, from restsurant menus and booking dinner reservations to having .things stocked in your room on arrival (Coke, wine/champagne, tonic) for reasonable charges. We checked in quickly, the agent at the front desk was pleasant and accommodating and helped us to surprise our friend with our arrival for which we were very thankful. So many customer service people are blas\u00e9 and indifferent- this was a treat. Our stay was pleasant enough although we found the common areas a tad tired and uninteresting, not as luxe as they could have been for the star level of the property (and the price point). We ate at the Japanese restaurant one night and it was excellent. Otherwise we found the restaurants rather overpriced. Luckily there is a small market 2 blocks from the hotel and we got breakfast items there for our last two mornings.

Our booked room was not ready when we walked up to it, it had no power supplied to it and was under construction (last thing you want after checking in quite late at night). 2.The staff are so busy with the guests (it gets crowded over xmas) you get sub-standard service - house keeping missed cleaning our room and wouldn't make it up despite numerous times of us calling front desk and house keeping , finally after getting fed up we walked down to the front desk personally and asked that our room is made up at 11.30PM!! And the house keeping manager looked less than delighted to oblige like she was doing us a favour. 2(b)While out trying to hire out snorkel gear to go snorkeling in the lagoon we waited about 15 minutes by the cabana where there are usually staff who can serve you there and there was absolutely no one in attendance. The young men who were on duty were too busy trying to hook up with girls at the lagoon , and there was about 5 of us waiting patiently until we got annoyed and went to ask the pool attendant to get someone to the snorkel gear cabana. And finally that happened. 3.The showers in the rooms we stayed (stayed in two diff rooms as we visited twice in Dec) in were absolutely filthy with black mould. So sad for deluxe ocean view rooms that have been recently renovated and made beautiful. The fridge in our room was dirty as well from previous guests spilling something inside of it. 4.We could not use the Jacuzzi by the pool as kids kept on diving into it and throwing their swimming gear in. There was no one in attendance not even their parents to tell them to go play in the pool as this is an adult area really. Made is incredibly unpleasant to be in the Jacuzzi and have a peaceful pinacolada , so we up and went. Poor poor poor service.

Ko'olina is a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, offering beautiful (but man made) beaches that are much less crowded and less crowds overall than Waikiki. However, there is NO shopping near by and very limited dining options within the resort. A short 10 minute drive to Kapolei opens up your options, but if shopping is important, this isn't the place for you. Ihilani itself is an excellent luxury resort, with great service and very nice rooms. When my fiancee and I arrived, we headed directly to the front desk, where we were greeted by a very friendly staff. Despite being a few hours early, we were notified that our room was already ready for us, so we headed up to our Deluxe Ocean View room on the 16th floor of the main tower. The rooms here are MASSIVE by Hawaii standards. All standard size rooms at the Ihilani are 387 sq. ft. Our room had a great king bed with a backlit headboard, a LCD HDTV, a large work desk with great work chair, a small table in front of the bed with two comfy chairs, tons of closet space, central A/C, and a ceiling fan. The bathroom in our room was a massive marble bathroom with his & her's vanity, glassed in shower stall, massive deep soaking tub, and a separate toilet. The entry foyer to the room had a small safe, coffee maker, and refrigerator. Our room was spotless, well maintained, and had a great update recently with a great blue and white motif with dark woods, marble, and granite. We only stayed one night this time, so we couldn't experience everything the resort has to offer, but we did order a \"milk & cookies turndown service.\" This was probably the one thing that disappointed me, as the hot cocoa (we subbed that for the milk) and cookies were great, but the room didn't receive an actual turndown. The room service we ordered for breakfast the following morning, however, exceeded expectations. Our room service attendant was very friendly and cheerful and delivered our breakfast to us on time on a cart that doubled as a good size table with white linens. So what did we order? Our breakfast was comprised of a cheese, mushroom, and spinach omelet (for me) with breakfast potatoes, toast, butter, and jams; a crab eggs benedict for the fiancee with breakfast potatoes; and guava juice for the both of us. Both dishes were great, though the potatoes and omelet could have used a touch of salt. While we enjoyed room service for breakfast during our stay, we did enjoy Ihilani's Italian fine dining restaurant, Azul, the night before. How was the restaurant? That's for another review! Besides Azul, Ihilani does also have poolside dining, a Japanese restaurant, a buffet restaurant, and a small coffee bar in the lobby. Other dining options include a Roy's restaurant down the street, a modern Japanese restaurant called YuZu that will open in summer 2012 across the street, the Paradise Cove Luau, a taco shop across the street, and ice cream shop across the street, a local food place across the street, and all of the restaurants at Aulani, a Disney Resort & Spa.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cStay somewhere else!\u201d", "Author": "buddha0404", "ReviewID": "UR127106805", "Content": "Marriott lists this location as a Category 6 on 7 point scale with 7 being the highest.

Unpleasant surprise upon checkin when the front desk advised that the spa was closed for renovations. There was a temporary setup in the Penthouse suite, but it was barely adequate for minimal services (massages) and there were no amenities. We had corresponded several times with the spa and no mention was ever made of the closure, nor was it disclosed on the hotel's website.

I will say the room was beyond beautiful and it was so relaxing to sit on deck and watch the ocean - very private. The grounds and walks were beautiful too. But the food/drinks - blech, and too expensive. Pool also pretty small - multiple pools at the neighboring resorts (including Marriott's own beach club) looked much more inviting. Also you can tell that the lagoon area nearest this property will soon be a nightmare when the Disney resort opens fully - too many kids for my adult taste. Although the only hot tub had specific signage forbidding children under 10 to use it, the hottub was treated like a kiddie pool - MANY toddlers with floating toys in there every day. We finally had the pool attendant kick out the toddlers one afternoon and we suffered the wrath of parents' dirty looks the remainder of the day.

We traveled to Maui 10 years ago.\u00a0 I was nervous that I wouldn't like Oahu, since people seem to encourage visiting the other islands over Oahu, but we were very pleasantly surprised with the beauty of Oahu. The JW is about 45 minutes from Honululu. The traffic on Oahu is TERRIBLE. Without traffic, it is easily a \u00a020 minute drive from the airport.\u00a0 We toured Waikiki and Honululu and you all can keep that city, thankyouverymuch. If I wanted to see a big city I wouldn't travel all the way to Hawaii to visit one. Anyway, Ko Olina is a very nice little 'neighborhood' . There are some residences, a golf course, a luau, a strip mall and three hotels on the complex which is gated off. We saw all three hotels and still decided that the JW was exactly where we belonged. There were three main disadvantages to the JW, compared to the other two hotels, and I'll get to those. But the one main advantage, which beat out the others for me, was the location of our room.\u00a0 I cannot express this point enough, but if you stay here, \u00a0PAY EXTRA FOR THE DELUXE OCEANVIEW ROOM!\u00a0 \u00a0The JW has rooms that are the closest to the actual ocean. The Disney property as well as the other Marriott property are set pretty far back from the ocean. If I wasn't so lazy, I'd post a video of the sound of the ocean crashing onto the rocks outside our room. Beautiful. And if it became too loud, you could easily close the balcony doors, and you had complete silence. There were enormous screen doors, so you really enjoy the fresh air. \u00a0Our room was on the 12th floor. The sunsets from our balcony were not to be believed!\u00a0 And the second highlight is that the balcony is very large!!! The other two hotel balconies were small in comparison. The rooms were very nice and comfortable. We were upset that they didn't offer cribs for babies, but 'pack and plays'. This probably is not the best resort for kids, but we were there for a conference so we had no choice.\u00a0 Other than that, the hotel is just nice. Nothing spectacular. It's starting to show its age. The pool is AWFUL. It's a circle that looks ridiculously small for the size of the hotel. But in February, we weren't swimming all that much. It was extremely breezy, with the high temperature being upper 70's to low 80's our entire week.\u00a0 The weather was absolutely beautiful for everything else, but not so much for swimming. \u00a0Unfortunately, since it was a little chilly, and the pool was not heated, the few kids that were at the property all sat in the hot tub, which was only supposed to be for people over the age of 10. And the hot tub wasn't even hot.\u00a0 The beaches at all three hotels are exactly the same. The sand is very course, but clean and the water was nice.\u00a0 The other two areas that the other hotels in Ko Olina \u00a0may have over the JW is that they are time share facilities so they are larger with kitchens, dining rooms, washers and dryers.\u00a0 The pool areas at the other two resorts were far superior to the pool at the JW. Especially for kids. The pool at the JW was so bad, that if I were a kid at this hotel and actually saw the pool areas at the other two resorts, I'd bawl like a baby.\u00a0 Fortunately for us, my Aunt was staying at the other Marriott property at the same time, and were able to use the pool for the day as her guests. FOR THE DAY is the operative word here. The Marriott and the Disney resorts are EXTREMELY STRICT with their pool areas. \u00a0At the Marriott, there were people wearing all sorts of wristbands. We wore red, for being a guest, the timeshare owners wore yellow, and if you were able to ride the waterslide you had to wear another bracelet to show you could swim. My sons had to take a swim test to be able to use the waterslide. Also, there is security EVERYWHERE on the Marriott property. So don't think you'll be able to pool hop.\u00a0 It was low season there, and I can't imagine how packed the Marriott pool would be if it was at full occupancy. We also toured the Disney property and took the vacation club time share lecture.\u00a0 This allowed us to see the entire property. It was OK. The rooms were nice, the balconies were small, the pool area was fantastic \u00a0(waterslide , lazy river) but the restaurant options on the property were very very very expensive, and limited, and when the third building opens, I have no idea where they are going to put everyone. The grounds of the Disney resort were very nice. I loved the pool area and the little cave where you could view the pretty fish. You can actually snorkel in that little pool (for an extra cost, of course).\u00a0 Both the Marriott and the Disney resorts seemed vast and large. I don't know how to put it other than saying that they weren't very 'warm' or 'welcoming'. \u00a0They were filming the Kelly Ripa show while we were there. There were a lot of people around for that. The JW has three restaurants on site. We only ate at the casual restaurant for dinner once, when they offered a valentines day buffet. The other nights we ate near the excursions we took or the strip mall, which was within walking distance from the JW. \u00a0We also ate at Roy's on the golf course which was wonderful but fully \u00a0booked. \u00a0It seemed everyone wanted to eat there. if you want to eat there during your stay, make reservations early.\u00a0 There is a shuttle that stops at all three resorts, and at some points during the day, stops at the golf course and the Paradise Cove luau. We visited Pearl Harbor, Hanauma bay for snorkeling \u00a0(skip that. Although its a pretty location, it was crowded and the water was very murky. The best snorkeling we've ever done was in Cozumel, and this did not compare. That clarity of the water in Cozumel was much better. ) We also rented a car and drove all over the island. We drove to the Dole pineapple factory, the north shore (you MUST see those waves! ) and even tried the flea market at the aloha stadium. (great place for souvenirs!)

We went around Nov 2011. Me & my husband were very excited to stay at the resort, we did a lot of research before we booked and read all the reviews here on trip advisor. We stayed there for about 12 days for our honeymoon. Let me start by saying driving by the gate to enter the resort it looked fabulous. We choose to self park park to save money, made our way to the lobby, which was nicely kept. My husband went to the front desk to check us in, & found out that our room was not the one we requested. So we had to wait about 15 minutes till they got a room. Rooms: They were okay, nothing fancy, not for the price that we paid. I would say it's like any other hotel room i've been to. The view also was not what we wanted, but I was not going to let that spoil my mood after all we were on our honey moon. They gave us the room facing the garden with all the birds which were pretty loud in the morning. So I had the door shut so we didn't have to hear the noise that much. We adapted ok for the 12 days. The bathroom needed a lot of work, the shower was leaking water to the floor and we had to put towels to prevent the water from going into the rest of the bathroom. We called maintenance to fix it which they said they would when we leave the room, but it was never fixed through out our entire stay it was leaking. No bathroom robes, which i thought was odd, with a resort that big you would expect that, especially for the money being paid to stay there as a guest. The powder room, it just felt like they did not clean it at all when we leave the room. They would empty out the trash and that's it. Food: the food was extremely expensive at the resort, we had our first breakfast there and decided to go shopping a few miles down the street & brought our food back & put it in the fridge. There were a lot of families who did that & so we decided to do the same thing. Transportation: Since the resort is so far away, I would def recommend getting a car if you plan to explore Oahu like we did. We drove to Lanikai, Beach which is a must see the best beach I have ever been to in my entire life. Drive up to the North Shore if you like to see the high waves. This hotel is not for honeymooners for sure, because the Disney Resort is right next door and there are so many kids around, especially the lagoon areas which are not far away from each other. I would recommend staying somewhere else if you are looking for romance and quite time. We made the best out of it but wanted to share with you my experience with you all.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cThis resort is expensive but the view from the top floor was magnificant\u201d", "Author": "havefuninthesun", "ReviewID": "UR123860554", "Content": "This is our second trip to this very nice property.

This was our fifth trip with previous stays at mostly Ritz Carlton. In my opinion this hotel was way better than our experiences at Ritz. We had a deluxe ocean view on the quiet side overlooking the lagoon of stingrays. I could have sat on the veranda on the chaise lounge all day just listening to the ocean. The room was bigger than ones we had experienced on previous trips like this and had a very large bathroom as well. We loved the small touches like the great spa quality toiletries. For once we didn't have any problems so we had little interaction with the staff for the most part except the housekeeping lady who was extremely nice and friendly. I'm not sure how expensive the hotel room would have been without the group rates so I cannot speak to that but the one thing that I thought was way too expensive was the overnight parking at $40/night plus we had to pay some weird porterage fee just to be able to use the valet (there really isn't a self park option and I would think at $40 might that would include access to the valet). If you are looking for a huge grand resort this is not the place but I think thats why I like it. It always felt quiet except in the lobby at certain times. They have one main pool but access to the four lagoons that serve the other area hotels and condos. This area of the island is about 20 miles from Honolulu but in my opinion this was a huge plus! I didn't care for the bustle of Waikiki and much preferred the quiet area around Ko'polei. I was concerned that the Disney Aulani was next door but to be honest it was self contained and not garish and did not interfere with the Marriott at all. We toured the Disney property thinking we may bring the kids back one day but decided if we did that we would prefer to stay at the Marriott. From the location if you have a rental car you can drive wherever you want to visit on the Island. I recommend a trip to the North Shore and also to Kualoa Ranch.

Best Sushi I ever had and plenty of excellent side dishes as well.. ran $100 for two and was a great value. We also ate one dinner at the Family restaurant and were not impressed. The menu choices were really limiting. It was ok and nothing special. One of the downsides of this hotel is a lack of resturants nearby. There is an Italian in the hotel but we did not get to try it. Even if you have a car, however, there is not much of choice nearby. We also found the drinks at the pool reasonably priced and the service good. The one irritation was a $36 per/day parking fee which you had to pay whether or not you used the valet or not. I think this outrageous when you are paying nearly $400 per-night for a room. The year before, we stayed at Turtle Bay and I only recall paying for parking if you used the valet. Overall, this was a great stay and the weather was perfect. I don't think you will find a better resort hotel. The year before, we stayed at Turtle Bay and its was nice as well but a bit different.

Bit of a surprise in a place like this to find no minibar, but the hotel bar itself was very friendly and I was astonished to encounter two staff members who recalled what I had ordered the night before. The pool is small and shallow but you can get a good swim in the lagoon a few yards away across the beach. Over the course of the stay, we ate, and ate well, at the poolside bar, at the Naupaka Terrace and at Ushio-Tei, the Japanese restaurant. Japanese is one of my favorite cuisines and ordering \u00e0 la carte here we had a memorable meal; others reported that the buffet option was a disappointment. The welcome continued throughout our stay - reception, restaurant, bar, poolside, parking and housekeeping staff all seemed, without exception, quite genuinely and spontaneously to want us to feel welcome. As noted by others, the parking is hideously expensive. However, I stumbled across the fact that the group we were with had negotiated a concessionary self-parking rate of $15/day and, when I was checking out, heard that the group that followed us had negotiated a rate of $10, so be sure to ask about this if you think you might be eligible.

But one suggestion: if you have little kids go to a different resort - Marriot Awailea is the other hotel we stayed at on this trip, much better for kids - but from a different island - Maui. To be fair they did promote cool 1-2-hour activities for the kids everyday, from cookie decoration to ginger bread house decoration. The beach in front of the hotel is really beautiful, good for little kids, but the water was really cold, so was the water from the pool. December is really windy in Oahu, if you get cold easily choose a different month to visit this side of Oahu. We also went to Maui and there it wasn't windy. My wife is telling me to mention that we were glad we were not on the Disney resort next door, because it was really crowded.

We immediately noticed how less crowded it was when we strolled across the street to the ABC store & saw less than 5 people in our 2 block walk. The rocky beach was fun to explore & climb around on and again, usually less than 5 people in sight. Sunsets were amazing! We were glad we had a rental car while staying here as you do feel very isolated. We got there at 2 and check-in time was 3, but it was nearly 4 before they were ready for us. For the delay, they comped us 2 drinks at the poolside bar & grill, which was nice. They also granted my request - & guaranteed it - for a late check out on the day we checked in - usually you have to request that the day of check out & it's not guaranteed. We appreciated their flexibility. The food at the hotel restaurants wasn't that great & very over priced. We were disappointed with each meal & only ate there 3 times as result. You pay for convenience. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much and would stay again.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "romadaro", "ReviewID": "UR122309366", "Content": "Just spent one night at the JW after a weeklong stay at the Ko Olina Beach Club and I thought the hotel was in great shape and we had a very pleasant stay. I walked the grounds extensively after reading a few other reviews and saw nothing in disrepair and based on our room, which was large and clean, and the common areas, this property deserves a five star rating. My wife fell in love with the dining room next to the pool and we both thought it was extremely elegant and found the food superb and the service to be top notch. Fortunately, since we are owners at Ko Olina, we were able to escape the nickel and dime charges that others mentioned, although I would have to say that I didn't find the charges to be out of line with what other hotels in the area charge. I know from experience that parking at both the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Hyatt Regency Waikiki also run around $40 per day, in addition to internet charges of $20-$25 per day if you're not an elite member. Seriously! As far as the Alani next door is concerned, it's just not fair to compare the JW to a property that's brand spanking new and just opened it's doors a few months ago. Of course, it's going to look better. What did you expect? There are a lot more kids around the lagoon with the Alani there than there were a year ago before it opened and it's noisier than I remember, but I didn't find it to be annoying or out of control. But, given a choice, I'd choose the JW over the Alani anyday because when the noise is contained between four walls it's a lot louder than out in the open.

The people were all very freindly and we set up some really nice trips through the Expedia guide at the concierge desk. We had an ocean view room which was absolutely perfect. The view overlooking the lagoons is spectacular. The room was in great shape and housekeeping did a great job coming in and cleaning up everyday. The room was also very spacious. We called down the first night and asked for Robes and they brought us robes from the Spa. The hotel is quite a ways away from everything, but that is exaclty what we wanted. We rented a car for two days and went to see Pearl Habor, the Dole plantation, the North shore, Waimea Valley, Sunset beach, etc. We are really glad we decided to do this because the other side of the island is so much different than the southern side. You really need to see everything. The pool is just ok, the pool at the Disney resort and the Marriott vacation clubs are much nicer, but we are more beach people anyway. The restaurants were all amazing, Ushio Tei was my favorite, definitely try their Monday and Friday buffett. We had breakfast every morning at Naupuka Terrace and the food was excellent. Prices are definitely high, but you have to expect that at any resort you stay. The only complaint i have is that there was no happy hour on the resort.

We stayed 6 nights. Two adults, 2 teen boys ages 16 and 13. I hope this review helps you in making your travel plans! Hotel: This is a very nice hotel. It used to be a 5 star when built by the Japanese 20 years ago but when purchased by Marriott, they made it more family friendly and the rating is now 4 stars. The hotel is beautiful and only slighted dated. We had two rooms on the 14th floor with amazing views. The rooms were huge and very nice. Definitely 5 star rooms! Pros: wonderful views of the coves; great staff; great location in the Ko'Olina resort area. Restaurants are ok...we only ate our first night at the less expensive one and ate several times at the pool. The spa is very nice and very talented staff. The coves are awesome and one of the best things about staying here or anywhere in this area. The beach area is great...you can take a great walk or run along all the coves and walk to the restaurants at the other hotels (which we did several times) Cons: We play tennis so anticipated a better experience. The courts are just ok. They charge $23 /hr and provide balls that were used. Its on the rooftop of the spa (separate building) and it is very windy. We had a view of this and never saw anyone really playing so was disappointed that they even charged. The pool is way too small for this resort. And it was full of kids so really not a relaxing place to hang out in the water. The hot tub was taken over by the kids which was one of our biggest disappointments. Most people swam in the cove (which is awesome) No self serve laundry. If you have the choice, look into staying at the nearby Marriott Beach club. It has a much better pool area, better restaurant and just more things \"happening\" there. Disney also looked nice but probably pricier. Beware of driving to/from this area into Honolulu. The traffic is terrible especially during their rush hour (starts early). There is tons to do on Oahu. A week wasn't long enough. Here's a few things we recommend: North Shore: definitely worth visiting for the day. Great beach towns, great fruit stands and shrimp trucks. Stop at the Dole plantation on the way back. My kids loved the big maze. Skip the dole whip...way too sweet and not really that good. Pearl Harbor area: Nothing really to say except go! We recommend getting there by 9am. Do the sub tour and USS Missouri in addition to the Arizona. Waikiki: We didn't spend enough time there but had dinner at two places that were both good and fun: Duke's Canoe Club and Tiki's. East shore beaches: the drive was a nightmare and we went on a very very windy day so not really a place we would recommend. The beaches were beautiful. I guess it depends on the time of year so check the weather forecast before taking the long ride Luau: we did the Paradise Cove luau...within walking distance of the hotel. Don't waste your money! The food was not good and the luau was only ok. For us, a very wasted night. We left early. Restaurants: Highly recommend Roys and Chuck Steakhouse in the Marriott Beach Club (ate there twice). For lunch, either the ABC store or the Taco place across the street. Both good options. Drinks: everything they make is too sweet (unless you like those types of drinks). We had a hard time finding a good martini or margarita anywhere on the island. Chuck's made the best! Good luck planning and have fun and relax. Hawaii is beautiful!

From the moment we pulled up to The Hotel till the moment we \"had to go\"....we were greeted and treated with the utmost warmth and hospitality. The GM obviously empowers the staff to allow each situation the personal attention it requires, there is no \"cookie cutter\" hotel treatment here. We were so grateful to have selected this property! While the hotel itself is a bit older, the experience makes up for it. The amazing room we had was updated and fresh and clean! Huge with lots of storage. Slept like a baby each night, very comfortable. We had commanding views nightly of the most incredible sunsets! Our room was attended to twice daily with great detail. Always very clean and items replenished. Great Housekeeping! There was never an issue with waiting for elevators. The pool area is not large, but we never had an issue finding a seat! None of the \"get up at dawn\" to secure your spot craziness going on here! Right below the pool was a great lagoon to float, snorkel or just swim protected by rocks for a safe and peaceful experience. We had the pleasure of seeing great fish and swimming alongside sea turtles! There is an activity cart located adjacent to the hotel/lagoon area with rentals for all your beach needs. There is a great walkway that takes you from the tip of the area down to the marina, a great walk alongside all the lagoons and various other lodging choices. There are other dining choices (as previous posters have pointed out) along the way. There is a workout area located in the Spa building just outside of the front area. We enjoyed a morning workout daily, not too large well appointed with tv's on each piece of cardio equipment, a small but efficient weight area and a few tennis courts outside with beautiful views of rainbows almost daily! The Spa is wonderful. They have daily specials, so take time to look at their services. We enjoyed a couples massage and really had a relaxing experience. The amenities at The Spa are plentiful, clean and relaxing and professional. We really enjoyed the dining choices in the hotel. The breakfast buffet in the morning offered many options for indulging or healthy dining! Lots of fresh fruits and hot items, the choice is yours. If breakfast is not your thing, there is a coffee lounge in the lobby with lots of espresso choices with light choices for breakfast, especially if you are on the run, great choice. We loved the lunch by the pool, there is always a fresh fish option daily. We really looked forward to it. You could sit at tables of at the bar. The staff at the \"pool bar\" always was always friendly and went out of their way to make you happy. You could also lunch at naupaka terrace, this is the main restaurant which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also have a large brunch on Sundays and a seafood feast on Saturday evening. We enjoyed the signature restaurant, Azul. A lovely romantic setting, great food and service. Never experienced room service, so can't comment. There is a Japanese restaurant onsite, Ushio Tei; while not a bad experience, it was our least favorite of all the other options. We tried the buffet and not sure if it was us, or just not a \"good night\". There is a bar located above this restaurant that we found later in our stay that offers a warm and relaxing experience where you have comfortable seating with great views and you can order food from all the restaurants for that casual but lo key experience at night. The drink menu here was very reasonable. Located at the golf course across the street is Roys, we had a terrific dinner here one night also. Reservations recommended! We enjoyed golf a few times atThe Ko Olina Golf Course, convenient and resort course oriented, not difficult, you are able to charge your round back to the JW. We ventured out of the area a few times, up north to enjoy the surfers and the drive and beauty of the region, stopped at the jamesons by the sea haleiwa on the way back for a good dinner in a casual setting. Another day we headed to the the winward coast to Koolau Golf Club for an amazing experience, the course is located on the side of a mountain in a rain forest. We had a time of it (we are golfers) and found out afterwards that this is one of the most difficult courses out there! Stopped in Honolulu for dinner on the way back, and really looked forward to spending the rest of our stay in Ko Olina! Being on the Leeward side of the Island, the weather is more arid and hence less rain so you can enjoy the activities outdoors without the rain, more often. My recommendation would be to read up on all that the resort has to offer immediatley. My mistake was finding things out too late in our stay. Sit with the concierge and get some information, they are available throughout the day. There are daily event sheets, make sure to take one each morning and read it with your delicious coffee. There are a few shopping experiences located within the property. Across the street (walking distance), there is a small mall area with a couple of dining options, didn't try. There is an ABC store as mentioned in previous posts. I can't say enough about the location. As we were not traveling with children, the services were perfect for us. I can say that if I did have young children with me, I would look at the Marriott Vacation club just a walk down the way or Aulani next door. The lifestyle in this area is peaceful and very relaxing. Again, kudoos to the staff at this wonderful resort, they make sure you are comfortable and happy, more of a boutique resort type experience, would recommend if you are in need of a relaxing vacation with all amenities available if needed.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in a gorgeous setting\u201d", "Author": "anoasis", "ReviewID": "UR120575446", "Content": "This hotel was way beyond my expectations- not a run of the mill hotel by any means. the rooms were gorgeous with floor to ceiling glass doors leading to a far larger than average terrace with louge chair, table and chairs and of course the gorgeous views.

The beach is nice with nice lounge chairs but the ocean here, as everywhere in Hawaii, is very cold. There is a hot tub by the pool to warm up in afterwards! Very relaxing stay. The breakfast at the hotel was also crazy expensive to us ($26/each for a standard cooked buffet). but the valets were as ever great about pointing us to local favorite Koa Pancake House, after the first time we ate there every morning! All the staff were just fantastic- one night we had been hiking all day and went back to our room to watch a movie and couldn't get the DVD player to work, a staff member was there in less than 5 minutes to hook it up for us (I wish I had him for my home as well!!) Overall it is an expensive resort, especially for meals, but very worth it if you want to relax.

If my only complaint is that the pool isn't as \"modern\" (lacking what seems to be the requisite swinging rope bridges and water slides) as all the other great spots on Oahu, just remember that the highly-rated Halekulani in Waikiki doesn't have a fancy pool for daredevils, either. This hotel sits on a fantastic beach, and, if you are on the beach-facing side, has fantastic sunsets every night. Since the new Disney timeshare resort is located immediately adjacent to the Ihilani on the mountain side, there was a lot of early-evening multi-media amplified noise and flashing lights, that fortunately seemed to be confined to the times when you would normally be at dinner.

We had spent months planning, and basing our hotel/resort picks on reviews that we read, therefore we made sure to pay attention to things we would review about in order to help other travelers!! The property and rooms were gorgeous and clean. We arrived a half hour before check in and were told that our room would not be ready for about 40 min, so we chose to take a 5th floor ocean view, rather than wait for the room on the 10th floor. May have been worth it to wait for the 10th floor, but the ocean view room was still amazing. The room was spacious and the bathroom was gigantic with a tub and shower, 2 sinks/vanities, and a toilet with its own door. Maid service was really great and got the room done early in the day, which was nice. Since we were on our honeymoon, we asked for an upgrade when we checked in, since my husband had an elite status on his rewards and therefore should automatically qualify. The hotel offered a room with 2 double beds, rather than the king we already reserved. We turned this down, since it didn't really make sense or seem like an upgrade. The hotel did offer 10% off at the restaurants on the resort for marriott rewards members. Restaurants had great drinks and food. Azul, in particular, although expensive, was worth the money. The food was amazing as was the service! The chef came out and introduced himself to check on the guests, which was impressive. Ushio Tei, the japanese restaurant was also good, but the waitstaff was pushy about picking the buffet, which didn't have a great selection in our opinions. The Hokule'a lounge was a lot of fun. Great food and the drinks were no where near as expensive as the poolside grill. The poolside grill was a convenient option if you wanted to eat and drink while sun bathing and swimming, but the food and drinks were really over priced. The menu we had checked ahead of time on the marriott.com website was outdated and inaccurate. They had their tropical drinks listed at $8.50, which was misleading since they were actually $14!! There seemed to be a lot of charges we hadn't planned on. A big downer was the lack of free internet. They hotel charged $7 for 10 minutes of internet use in the business lounge and the daily fee for wifi was over $20. We were suspicious that the hotel had an internet jammer of some sort since even our cell phone internet connections seemed to have an interference until we were off the resort. At one point my husband got frustrated and went right next door to the Disney resort and his phone started to work. The parking fee was $35, regardless of if you used valet or self park. Other places we stayed included self park fee in the resort fee, which is something this hotel should consider. The hotel puts a hold of $150 a day on your credit card when you check in, which we didn't know until we got there.

I'd requested a high floor but they put me on the sixth floor, which was right on the tree line. DO NOT stay on the sixth floor! That was where the pigeons seemed worst. They were constantly getting on our porch. I thought I would enjoy the coves and they were okay, but they had a more family/kid appeal than what I was hoping for, which I guess is to be expected with Disney next door now. One of the best afternoons we had was when we went to the pools at the Disney resort, but I would not pay $500/night to stay there. Some things I did like about the property: the pool is nice, drinks at the poolside bar were delicious, and if you walk to the north (past the sign that says 'now leaving resort property, enter at your own risk) there is a pretty cove with turtles and a GREAT snorkeling cove right across from the Paradise Cove luau. We had that beach to ourselves one morning and the snorkeling was very relaxing and nice, featuring a sea turtle as well. Also, we had a sunset view room and loved the view - just wish we could have enjoyed the lanai without the pigeon presence! We walked past the Disney night shows and had a laugh, very glad we weren't facing that direction, we would have definitely asked to move and that sounds like it was a pain. In general this hotel struggled with customer service. One day the maid didn't come to clean the room until 6:30pm, when we were trying to shower/relax - she apologized but it's still ridiculous for a room that costs this much. We also requested a late check out and never got a call back about whether it would be possible, so just checked out at the normal time. TIP: Avoid the 'Welcome Desk' coupons, they're just trying to sell you time shares. I would not go back here or recommend it, which is a shame, because we did have some good times here as well and the property definitely has nice features!

We later found out that the Disney resort was opening right next door the week we booked our trip. There was nothing we could do to change our trip and decided that we'd make the best of it and hope for the best. We booked the JW because we wanted to have a quiet getaway compared to that of a hotel in Waikiki. We checked in Sept. 19th and requested an ocean view room, we also asked that it not be facing the Disney resort...the front desk person assured us that it wasn't facing the other resort but did mentioned that it was their grand opening week and there were going to be several events including good morning america filming at 1am one morning. When we got to the room we walked out onto our balcony and had a perfect view right over Disney's resort event area where they have their luaus and receptions and had lovely background noise of them sound checking the conch for the opening ceremonies---this sound check went on for several hours in the afternoon and even if we closed the sliding door it was unbearable. We decided not to worry and went out for the day to explore some of the island....we arrived back at our hotel room at roughly 9pm that night hoping to sit out on the balcony and relax and enjoy our first night of our honeymoon. Well instead of relaxing and listening to the waves we heard Lady Gaga & the Black Eyed Peas blasting out of speakers. We couldn't sit outside and we couldn't even close the doors and have a conversation. When we called down to switch rooms we couldn't even hear the woman on the phone. My husband went down there to try and take care of it but they weren't able to switch our rooms until the following day. We paid for the upgrade to an ocean view room and didn't even get to enjoy that view. When asked if we could be refunded that money they said it wasn't possible. The music didn't stop until close to 10pm and still being on west coast time (1am) we were exhausted and upset and just went to bed and decided to try and deal with it the next day. We were able to switch to a different room the following day on the sunset side of the hotel and we didn't hear another thing from the Disney hotel. But our room wreaked of pot that smelled like it had been stored in the fridge or bar area of the room, every time we opened that door a waft of the smell came out. We didn't complain about that and just tried to enjoy the 4 days we had left. It's not often my husband and I take extravagant vacations and we aren't picky people- it takes a lot for either of us to be upset but that was not the way we imagined out honeymoon stay would be at a renowned JW Marriott hotel. We both realized that much of our complaint has to do with the resort next door and is out of their control- the hotel itself seemed to try to be accommodating when they could be but we still felt let down- especially when we were still charged for our upgrade. I can only imagine that the hotel would have been a wonderful place to stay before the ridiculous Disney compound moved in next door. If you are hoping for a romantic getaway I would recommend staying somewhere else and if you do stay at the Ihilani, make sure you are on the opposite side from the the Disney resort if you want quiet.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Property\u201d", "Author": "Tiflalawi-Adventures", "ReviewID": "UR118496676", "Content": "I was in town for an event at the brand new Disney Aulani Resort which is next door to this property.

The hotel itself has an infinity pool (which we didn't utilize) and these beautiful little ponds all around with stingrays and sharks. And koi fish. My 2-year-old loved it.

The area itself is not very crowded, which is always a plus. And the property staff was incredibly pleasant and helpful. The hotel food wasn't bad either.

This is a very nice, small resort tucked away in a beautiful area with the best weather on the island. If you want to be away from the big city hustle of Waikiki and experience the beauty of Hawaii, this is a great spot to be. Rooms \u2013 We had an Ocean View which appears to be identical to a \u201cdeluxe\u201d ocean view, except that they are on different sides of the resort. The room was very nice, consisting of a comfortable king bed with fitted sheets and a down comforter, a large L shaped desk with a large flatscreen TV on one side. There are two chairs and an ottoman at the end of the bed facing the TV. There is a bar area just inside the front door that host the coffee maker and a refrigerator that you can use to store your own items. No mini bar. The safe is in this cabinet as well. The bathroom is very spacious with marble floors and counters. There are two sinks, set across from each other. A good sized, deep tub, and a separate glass-enclosed shower. The toilet room has its own door for privacy. The balcony is spacious with a round wooden table and two chairs, plus one lounger. The views are fantastic from the Ocean view rooms. Deluxe Ocean views face West, looking over the pool and out at the ocean. Our Ocean View faced Northwest with an incredible Sunset view and a view looking over a beautiful bay just North of the hotel. Also included in our view was the parking lot of the Paradise Cove Luau, which was not a bother, everything to see was straight ahead. Spend as many nights as possible on your balcony for sunset. The internet is WiFi, available in the room with strong signal. It seems that they have repeaters in the room to guarantee good signal. There was a wired internet port in the desk but it did not work. Internet, as of this writing, costs 12.95 per day. We were on a package that made it free. And it is free to some Marriott rewards members as well. The TV had 20 or 30 usable channels and had the Lodgenet system with a good selection of recent movies available for on demand. The only negative experience we had with the room was spotty maid service. Timing constantly changed and two days we had to call for it. The hotel has a nice aesthetic. The lobby is marble and is at the bottom of an atrium that continues up to the top floor. Lots of ponds around the property with koi, stingrays, and hammerhead sharks. They have some programs where you can pet/feed the rays and also a fish feeding program on the beach every morning. The property has a nice Hawaiian flow and feel. Upkeep is not 100%, there are some cosmetic flaws around, but not enough to be a bother to all but the pickiest of folk. Our room showed no such problems, save a shower door that didn\u2019t close quite all the way. I\u2019ve seen many reviews here state that this property is not up to snuff with other JW Marriotts. I\u2019ve never stayed at a JW, but they seem to imply that JW is up there with Ritz Carlton\u2019s, Four Seasons, etc. Since the resort if \u00bd the price of those properties, I think it offers excellent value. But if you need that level of quality and price, consider the Disney Aulani resort that just opened next door. It is definitely at that level (more on that below). Parking - $36.95, valet or self park. Valet service is excellent, with a very friendly staff. Call first when you need the car. No one is happy with the price. It is what it is. Beach \u2013 The lagoon is a great size. It is shared by the Ihilani and the Disnehy Aulani resort. This was not an issue while we were there. The Aulani was in the middle of their soft opening, the beach was never over crowded. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect of the lagoon and how big it would be in person. My best answer is if that you think it is small, it will be bigger than you expect, and vice versas. It is a good size. The Ihilani only uses up one corner of the lagoon, which is more than enough. Every day there were many, many chairs available. The most crowded days were Saturday and Sunday, which were still very pleasant and spacious. You cannot serve alcohol on the beach in Hawaii, so there is no wait service on the beach proper. They have set the beach cabanas up on the grass just on the lip of the beach to skirt this problem. The cabanas are two wooden chairs with a shared, awning that you can raise and lower to your liking. They put covered cushions on them for you and give you a cooler with two bottles of water and two pieces of fruit . Cost is 20 for a half day and 35 for a full day. The water in the lagoon is great. There are no waves, and it is very pleasant to swim or lounge in. The hotel also provider snorkel gear for free for 1 hour per day. If you snorkel near the rocks you can see some fish and crabs and the like. You can also take your snorkel gear to the cove to the north for better snorkeling and a shot at turtles, etc. Food/drink service at the Cabanas was spotty. The waiter serving the Cabanas is also working part of the pool, and some were better than others at checking on the cabana customers. There is a Rec. desk near the cabanas and they will radio for a waiter for you as needed. There are a few thatched umbrellas on the beach. These were snagged quickly in the morning. Pool \u2013 The pool is quite small but was perfectly adequate for this resort. There were always plenty of chairs available, and there are a lot of umbrellas in the pool area if you want one. We were hear at the start of the low season, so perhaps it is more crowded at other times. Plenty of servers available in the pool area. The hot tub is in the main pool area also. The pool water was very warm and comfortable. The towel stand for the beach and pool is right next to the pool. Nearby Services \u2013 Ko\u2019olina is really well located. You are secluded in a beautiful area that really shows off Hawaii. But you are close enough to everything that Oahu has to offer. The city of Kapolei is one exit away, a 5 minute drive at most. Here you\u2019ll find a Target (with groceries) a Costco and several other stores and places to eat . Not much you won\u2019t be able to find here. Honolulu/Waikiki are an easy 25 minute drive away in most traffic. You can hop into the city for sightseeing, shopping or dinner anytime. The drive is easy and pleasant. They do have afternoon traffic here, especially try and avoid driving to Ko\u2019olina from Honolulu in afternoon rush hour. The North Shore is an easy, 45 minute drive away. Ko\u2019olina \u2013 Ko\u2019olina is really great. Just the kind of place you want to vacation. It\u2019s a huge secluded property. It\u2019s gated. The upkeep is very good. There are phases of private homes here, as well as 3 resorts, and one condo property. There are several restaurants on services on the property. The Islands market is on the same street as and an easy walk from the Ihilani. There are groceries and deli food and sundries and gifts here. There is also the Just Tacos restaurant here and an ice cream shop and I think I saw a Hawaiian BBQ place as well. The Disney Aulani resort is right next to the Ihilani and has several restaurants and bars. It is a very nice property and worth seeing. Further down in Ko\u2019Olina at the golf club there is a Roy\u2019s restaurant. Down at the opposite end from the Ihilani is the Marriott Beach Club Timeshare property. Chuck\u2019s Steakhouse can be found there. There is a shuttle that runs around the entire Ko\u2019Olina property all day and evening and stops most of the places. Make use of it. Of the restaurants we tried: Just Tacos is good. Mexican food and 400 tequilas. Not to be missed for Tequila lovers. Chuck\u2019s is just okay. Roy\u2019s is good, but not what it once was when Roy still owned it. Regarding the Beach Club Time Shares, when you check in at the Ihilani the front desk sends you over to the \u201cWelcome\u201d desk afterwards to get some info and some discount cards. The \u201cWelcome\u201d desk is the time share sales. They don\u2019t hound you too much here, but they will try to get you to go sit through the sales pitch in exchange for swag. Also, at the Rec. Desk on the beach, the guy in the brown shirt is hawking time shares, the guys in the blue shirts are the ones who get you equipment or setup cabanas, etc. Aulani \u2013 Lots of concern on these boards about the Aulani bringing crowds and Disney mayhem to the Ihilani customer\u2019s experience. There was zero issue of this while we were there. No crowding or noise issues. The Aulani\u2019s beach section is next to the Ihilani\u2019s but far enough away. Their beach was not more crowded or active than ours. A few things to know about the Aulani that we learned. This is not a Disney theme parky kind of resort. This is a very upscale resort (Ritz level, $400+ room rates) focused very strongly on a Hawaiian cultural theme. In certain parts of the hotel, they require the employees to speak Hawaiian to each other, and a heavy focus on teaching Hawaiian culture. Half of the resort is Time Share, and therefore not all sold yet. So, not sure if they are seeing full capacity yet. We understand that the hotel portion is booked for a year plus in advance. The crowds may get worse, but so far, no problem at all, and the place seems quite nice. Tips \u2013 There is a Starbucks (Drive Thru!) in Kapolei. Also one in the Target. I know this is important to some people (I\u2019m married to one!) A little further down the road at the Waikele/Waipahu exit, there is a shopping center that has a Leonard\u2019s Malasadas truck in the parking lot. These fresh fried doughnut ball like items are island legend and should not be missed, but eat them while they\u2019re hot. Also at the Waikele/Waipahu exit is a large Premium Outlets Center for those who just gotta shop. When traveling into Waikiki from Ko\u2019Olina, use the locals route to bypass some of the traffic you hit on the H1 near Waikiki. When on the H1 heading east. Look for the 92 Nimitz Hwy exit. BUT\u2026ignore the first one\u2026a few miles later you see a second 92 East Nimitz Hwy exit that says \u201cWaikiki\u201d on the sign. Take that exit, and it is a 3 lane, flowing street that eventually turns into Ala Moana Blvd. and takes you straight to the heart of Waikiki. This route will take you right past popular spots like Hilo Hatties, Restaurant Row, and the Ala Moana Shopping Center.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGreat suite at the Ko Olina\u201d", "Author": "Slowhand1527", "ReviewID": "UR118035821", "Content": "Stayed at the JW Marriott Ko Olina Ihilani hotel on Oahu again and this time had a suite and it was fantastic.

A little overpriced.\u201d", "Author": "NHTraveler03301", "ReviewID": "UR118014741", "Content": "Let me start this review by saying that the JW Marriott Ihilani is a great hotel, and we'd stay there again in a heartbeat. The rooms were spacious, the food was very good, and the service was top notch. There were a few things that we noticed that could be improved, but nothing that would keep us from returning. We stayed at the Ihilani in July, 2011 for eleven nights with our two kids (ages 11 and 8). We were given the option before arriving of upgrading to the Naupaka Jr. Suite, and took them up on it. Boy were we glad we did! The room was huge, and had more than enough room for the four of us to spead out, place a rollaway in the corner, and still have more than enough room. With such a long stay, having all that room was a godsend and kept us and the kids from getting on each others nerves. If you get the room, make sure to take advantage of the mini fridge (comes empty) for water, snacks, wine, etc. that you can get from the hotel store. Even better, take a 5 min. walk to the shopping area one block away and there is one of Hawaii's famous \"ABC\" stores. They seem to have everything you would need for a vacation there, even down to snorkeling equipment. Everything was of good quality, and you will save a ton of money over the hotel store. Speaking of this shopping plaza, it seems that the area is about to expand. With the Disney hotel opening up this month, you can see that developers are anticipating higher foot-traffic and beginning to put in stores, ice cream shops, restaurants, etc. This is great as it increases your choices when staying at the Ihilani. Something I would be quite concerned about, however, with the addition of the Disney hotel (Aulani) would be the number of people on the property's beach. When we were there, the beach was wonderful. Nice and quiet, and just the right number of people on it. You could spread out, and not feel like anyone was on top of you. My wife and I spent a lot of time looking at the size of the Aulani and trying to picture all those families swarming the beach. Certainly adding hundreds of people to the area will change the feel of the place, and I would hesitate on going back because of it. (at least read some reviews first!) Another thing about the Ihilani. You will need a car. The hotel is secluded, which we really enjoyed. Waikiki is much too busy for us, and the Ihilani had much more of an island feel. If you intend on going anywhere else (and you should!) you will find yourself driving at least 30 min. in any direction. Make sure not to miss the West side of the island. It is simply breathtaking. Make sure to also make time for Pearl Harbor, a swim at Waimea falls and the Diamond Head hike. If you go to Diamond Head, make sure you are in fairly good shape and bring water. An older woman needed to be airlifted off it when we were at the top. Now for a few of the negatives. The hotel has a strict towel policy. If you don't have your towel back by the end of the day (about 8pm) your room would be charged. (I think $15 per towel if I remember correctly!) For a higher-class hotel, we found this to be particularly low-rent. It would be nice if the hotel had beach towels available in the rooms so that if you left for the day, you wouldn't have to rush back to save the $60! Also, for a hotel that is in my opinion just a notch below it's sister Ritz properties and charges similarly, the hotel should set a higher standard for it's rooms. The room was a bit of a mishmash of furniture and electronics. For example, the room had two big screen TV's. Great right? Well not when they are only about 7ft apart and facing the exact same way. We noticed art missing off the walls, and there were empty spots in the room with no furniture at all. Maybe the room is so big, the hotel doesn't know what to fill it with...but it does look a bit awkward. Oh, and the parking fees: for a hotel where you almost HAVE to have a car, charging a nightly rate of $35 is outrageous. Make sure you factor this in when looking at the total cost of the room. An important point: Don't eat at night on your lanai. The hotel has roaches that will smell your food within seconds and come scurring around. We figured this out very quickly. No food, no roaches within sight. Before we figured this out we had killed four or five big ones. Don't worry, we never saw any in the room even though we had food all over the place! As for food at the hotel, the breakfast at the Naupaka Terrace was incredible. I particularly enjoyed the Filipino Omelet. Yum! We never needed to order the buffet. Ordering a' la carte was more than enough food for us, delicious, and much less expensive. We tried Azul, which was wonderful, and their Japanese restaurant which was OK. The pool-side fare was cheap and ill-prepared. I would stick to drinks and snacks only. One of our favorite things to do was to take a nightly stroll down the beachwalk. You can get to the other side in about 20min, and if you go at sundown, the view is spectacular. (Hint: book Chuck's Steak House at the Marriott's time-share hotel for about 8pm. The food is great, and you'll be just in time for the sunset on the walk over) Don't bother with the time-share's poolside grill (Longboards, I think) as the food there was definitely sub-par. Too bad, as the atmosphere there is incredible. One last thing. Don't miss the Luau next door, the Paradise Cove Luau. Yes, it is a bit cheesy, but the kids had a great time, and the food was pretty good too! All in all, it would be hard not to have a good time at this hotel, but definitely look into the Disney issue, as it looks like it could become a problem.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, WA", "Title": "\u201cNot what you would expect from a JW Marriott\u201d", "Author": "aug08bride", "ReviewID": "UR117837356", "Content": "This was our third stay at the Ihilani, we want to give this place 5 stars for the beauty of the property.

Apparently, Marriott came in and purchased an existing property, to which they affixed the JW label; that's fine, if the property lived up to the brand's reputation. This one does not. From the lousy, tiny pool, to the rocky, unwalkable beachfront, you'd be better off staying in Waikiki.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cInstant mashed potatoes and had to move furniture in our suite to get to our bed!\u201d", "Author": "whitcanna", "ReviewID": "UR117603347", "Content": "Here now...we have been here four times...they seem short-staffed.

The location is a distance from everything, but well worth it. The resort is on the west side of Oahu but easy to find. The hotel is right off the main Hwy-H1 with its own exit. When you arrive the grounds are gated, like a small community. Upon entering the gates you notice the Paradise Cove luau, Ihilani, Marriot Beach Club and the new Disney resort on the beach side. Across from Ihilani are some new stores fronts with restaurants, ABC store-grocery/gift shop, and still growing. Near to that is Roy's restaurant. A shuttle from the hotel will take you to each place, very convenient. The hotel itself is beautiful. Breathtaking views of the beach and man-made lagoon. The grounds has a total of four lagoons spread out along the beach. Our room was on the tenth floor with a view of the ocean thru white sliding shutters and glass doors onto a private balcony. We enjoyed dining each morning on the balcony which has a table,chairs and a chaise lounge. The room was very clean, spacious and nicely appointed. It has a refrigerator and you can rent a microwave for $10 a day. The hotel is nice size with a few places to eat, a couple of shops-gifts/sundrys, one pool and a hot tub. The pool is round and not very large but does have nice seating some with umbrellas and a bar/restaurant. The lagoon is just steps down from the pool area and is very calm and beautiful. The entire staff of the hotel was very nice and helpful. The restaurants are pricey as well as the alcoholic beverages, but you are on vacation in paradise. I recommend eating outside of the resort for some meals, better food, better price and not far from the hotel (Assagio-italian food-excellent). While at the Ihilani we went snorkeling with Wild SIde Specialty tours and swam with wild dolphins, sea turtles and fish. Amazing, I highly recommend this tour! We also visited the Paradise Cove Luau, walking distance from hotel, and was disappointed. I indulged in the spa at the hotel and was extremely happy with my massage. The spa is beautiful, very relaxing and well worth it. The spa area also has a gym and lap pool which is included in your stay. We also did some exploring around the island and found it to be rather easy to navigate and not as far as we thought. Beautiful beaches on north and east coasts as well. The only negative I can express is the new Disney resort, which was preparing to open while we were there. DIsney built the hotel right next to the Ihilani. The lagoon which is not large will now be shared by both. The hotel is typical Disney style, huge and obnoxious. Being from Orlando, I can do without the mouse. I feel this area must have been so beautiful and quiet prior to this. I am so glad we were there before the Disney doors open. It truly is a shame.

This resort is in the KoOlina planned community and is situated along one of 4 manmade lagoons that are fed off of the ocean. The Ko Olina area is about 30 minutes from the airport and is far away from the frenetic pace of Honolulu. These lagoons are ringed by beautiful sandy beaches and essentially are large salt water pools; there are no waves to speak of. You can rent Kayaks, StandUpPaddleboards, water hammocks, snorkels, etc. The JW shares its lagoon with Disney's new (and HUGE) Aulani resort which is opening on 8/29. The Disney resort dwarfs the JW in size (but not height) and I think will result in the lagoon being much more crowded once the Disney resort opens. The JW is pretty limited as far as pools go; there is just one main pool which is pretty small and is not really a feature pool; there is a small pool at the Spa if you are there for treatments. We visited the Marriott KoOlina Beach Club (a Marriott Timeshare Property) at one of the neighboring lagoons; the pools there are much larger and more interesting. The rooms at the JW were gorgeous; we had two rooms which were adjoining. Everything is controlled by a video touch-screen terminal by your bed (climate, lighting, phone, etc). The mattresses were very comfortable, the bathrooms were enormous and very nicely equipped. The rooms had large ocean-view lanais. Customer service was excellent; the breakfast buffet was top-notch as well. We had dinner in the Sushi restaurant which was also very good.

The room itself was well-appointed with lots of storage and a comfortable bed. The bathroom included 2 vanities, a shower stall, soaking tub and a separate toilet area. The staff was very hospitable - they were great! For a deluxe hotel, the only thing we thought was peculiar were the absence of bathrobes and no complimentary internet access. Free internet access is available at the cafe downstairs. As for other hotel amenities, the fitness center is very clean and well-equipped for a hotel gym. If you would like a lounge chair by the pool, you will need to reserve early. The lagoons were wonderful and we were lucky enough to see a sea turtle while snorkeling. Valet parking is $35 a day for hotel guests - there is no way around this if you bring a vehicle. The valet service was very convenient and the attendants were courteous. It would help to call-in at least 5 to 10 minutes before you head out of your room to have your car brought up to the porte cochere.

For starters we had an \"oceanview\" room. We looked out over the lagoon and the ocean. If you go and get the oceanview asked to be up a little higher, the view is excellent. You will have a \"lanai\" (balcony) which is fantastic for just hanging out in the morning/evening when it is a bit cooler. Plus (for us) we had a great view of the sunset. Our room was beautiful. I was told many of the rooms had been renovated. Ours was extremely comfortable. But honestly, we didn't spend that much time in the room. But when we did it was very comfortable and nicely furnished. The people here were simply TOP NOTCH! They more than go out of their way to make you comfortable. We greatly appreciated so many of the wonderful people at this resort and the way we were treated. Warm smiles and excellent service. As mentioned in the title, Disney is opening in late August. I can only image the area being engulfed by families with young children. As it was it was really fairly quiet the week we were there. It was not crowded in the least. Getting a spot a the pool was never an issue. Nor was it an issue at the beach at the lagoon (which is very nice). We ate on and off the property. Eating on the property is pricey. There is no two ways about it. When we ate on property the food was very, very good. If you have read any of the other reviews you probably will read the same. We walked over to JUST TACOS for some very good Mexican fare the day we arrived. It is maybe 5 minutes away. There is also an ABC Store with fresh deli sandwiches available. There are pretty good as well. We had a rent-a-car so we ventured out most days. If you do venture out, and feel the need to check out the North Shore, be ware of the traffic. I wasn't quite prepared for the Hawaiian traffic jam. But as the beach goers go to and from their cars across the highway to and from the beach, they really slow up the traffic on the road. Just a \"heads up.\" Speaking of rentals. Parking your car on property is, in my opinion, a bit of a rip off. They charge $35/day (plus tax). The cost is the same whether you valet or not. So do the math. Nearly $40/day times 7 days just to park my car! While we are speaking of \"extras.\" Wireless internet is extra UNLESS you are Platinum Member. I can't recall the cost, but it is somewhere between $12-$15 per day. Again, I found this to be a bit extreme. You could circumvent the cost by using your computer in the lobby for free. Many, of course, did. If you like to snorkel we hit it about every day. The water in the lagoons is very, very calm which makes it very easy to navigate. In the lagoon in front of the facility you can see some fish if you snorkel near the rocks. If you to the next cove up it's pretty much the same, but supposedly have a better chance of seeing turtles. We actually saw a seal in our cove late one afternoon. If you want a guarantee of seeing turtles go out of the facility and go to the right. Walk until the sidewalk ends and keep going a bit further and there will be a very small cove. Go past this cove to the next cove. It takes a little effort to get to (kind of a tough walk, but not far at all). It is relatively shallow. First time when went it there were FIVE turtles just hanging out. It was pretty cool. If you want to go on a snorkeling excursion I/we highly recommend HAWAIIAN NAUTICAL. The people on the boat are awesome. They do a great job making sure you have a great time. JW Marriott was great. I would go back.

When we first came my kids were 5 and now they are 15! The best thing about this hotel is the man made lagoons which front the resort. My kids learned to love the ocean, in safety, here. The lagoons actually open to the ocean so sea life can enter freely but bigger nasties can't get in. I'll always remember the first time I held one of my daughters out in the water, when she was five, out in the deeper water. She put her face in the water w/her googles and saw MAGIC! She looked up at me with gigantic eyes and then plop her face went back in the water and that is basically how we spent the rest of the trip w/me holding her in the water. The resort itself is lovely with huge rooms, even huger bathrooms, and large balconies- many with fantastic views. My family likes the rooms overlooking the pool and than out to the ocean, but the rooms that overlook the garden/shark/fish pools have nice views as well. If you want more seclusion they have a building that has lovely sunset views, where they appear to put the couples/honeymooners. The bathrooms in this resort have two sinks and a shower which is separate from the large bath. Very nice for a family. The bathtubs are big enough for 2 or three kids- mine used to play in the bath w/their toys when they were little. The rooms are tastefully decorated and newly renovated. If you can afford a suite, it's worth it. The staff is very friendly, the morning breakfast buffet a must. When we first came, the one thing that was lacking was ability to get to restaurants outside the hotel, without a drive. A couple of years ago a shopping area opened right across the street from the resort, an easy walk away. Now there is an excellent Mexican restaurant, a high end shopping mart, that sells ready made food, and a wonderful ice cream/deli type restaurant and more too come. A Disney resort is opening next door as well, so families at this resort will have access to the neat Disney restaurants, without having to stay in the smaller and less upscale Disney rooms. We don't golf, but apparently the golf course is excellent for the golfers in your family. It's very easy from this resort to get to the North Shore and into Honolulu as well. There is a shark pool and a sting ray pool and your kids can feed the sharks and swim with the sting rays! The restaurants at this resort are fine to excellent. The pool is pretty and the food served poolside is kid friendly, but with plenty for the adults as well. Azul, the fanciest restaurant at the resort, is unbelievable. There is a Sushi place and the main restaurant. as well, which serves a pretty varied menu. The restaurant at the golf course, Roys, is very upscale, with wonderful service and a great wine list. There are two Luaus- one next door at Paradise Cove- which lots of people come in from Honolulu to see, or a smaller one which was being held a couple of lagoons down at the other Marriott property when we were there. I'd recommend the smaller one- much more enjoyable and less cookie cutter. All in all this resort is the best place to bring a family in all of Hawaii in my opinion.

To make up for the inconvenience, they upgraded us to an ocean deluxe suite. I told the guy, that since we have a place on the beach already, (it was rented out) we didn't really care about the view. At the end of the second hour, I took out the Ipad and was ready to throw in the towel, dispute my charge later, and move on. Unfortunately, I could not access the internet and our room was ready. Upon entering the room, I have to say I was very surprised at the size and the incredible view. It was very clean as I checked the top of the lamp shade and the slats in the shutters. The shower had a tiny bit of mildew, but nothing to scream about. Also, the closet had tons of storage and extra drawers. If you have a mountain/city view room, I would definitely pay to upgrade. Normally, I don't believe in paying extra, but in this case you will get your money's worth. The bags took longer than expected so we had to call a second time. Parking is not 35.00. It's 36.48 including tax, which is outrageous, and you don't have another option. You have to valet it, so add on another fee for the tips. You could self park (same price), but it's down the hill and behind the hotel. Now for the noise. Construction at the Aulani begins promptly at 7:00am and you could somewhat hear it on the ocean side but it then again, below you is the pool with kids screaming and can hear the airplanes and waves. Simple solution is to close the sliding glass doors and you have silence. There are rooms directly facing the Aulani at the back of the hotel, and some on the other side, so these must be the rooms that everyone was complaining about. Beds were very comfortable and I preferred it over the Westin Heavenly Bed. Did not eat at any of the restaurants as there are so many great places to eat in Hawaii. Had a great meal at the Kapolei Club House (Golf course) which is open to anyone. Staff tried to be as accommodating as they could, but there obviously is a shortage of personnel. Having stayed at almost all the hotels in Waikiki, I have to say this place has a great location. The other hotels (ie Trump) have good rooms but the location is not on the beach, or the hotels are on the beach (ie Sheratons) but the rooms are awful. Also, keep in mind that traffic to and from this hotel is horrible.

I am not sure where I can begin as there were so many things wrong with this dump. I will start with the first thing one encounters which is parking. This is highway robbery as they charge $36 a day. The hotel will give you a line that this is common and many hotels for example in New York, Chicago, Boston, etc. will charge for parking. This is a terrible argument. First of all, there is no shortage of space at the hotel. Parking is a revenue stream and no doubt a huge part of their profitability. More importantly, if you go to a hotel in a city on the mainland that charges for parking, it is usually significantly cheaper to self park. In addition, you have a choice. For example, in New York or anywhere else, if you do not want to pay the hotel parking, you can park in a lot on the street for less than half. At this hotel, you cannot and there is zero choice. They have heard this before but do not care because you have no choice and this is no doubt their biggest earner. I had arranged for an upgraded junior suite (which by the way is not even a suite, just a slightly larger room) connecting to a two bedded room for my kids. Well, it turns out that the room was supposed to be \u201cadjacent\u201d (translation not connecting). It was never specifically pointed out to me that the rooms did not connect. OK, I will concede that maybe I should have paid more attention to their lingo and this was my fault. I asked for truly connecting rooms and was told I would need to wait until the next day. I wait a long time for the manager who does not seem to care and just goes to the back and disappears. OK, I deal with it. Prior to leaving the next morning, I stopped by the front desk and asked them to move our luggage (which was packed and ready to go) to the new rooms, empty the fridge and put the contents in the fridge of the new room, provide a new rollaway bed and have it made up, provide extra sheets, bathroom amenities and finally, to call me when the room was ready and this was done. I was told \u201cNo problem sir. It will be done between 2 and 3 and we will call you as soon as it is complete.\u201d Well, I got no phone call whatsoever. We returned at 6 PM and did get two connecting rooms. However, no luggage was transferred and none of the other requests were fulfilled. Of course, no one from the front desk staff let alone a manager bothered to call to see if the new rooms were ok. Also regarding the rooms, was the cleanliness. It was very poor in particular the bathrooms. As an example please see the uploaded photo of the mildew in the shower. The hotel said they would clean it but it never got removed. It was definitely mildew not an imperfection in the tile because it was on the grout as well and one when touched it, you could feel the texture on the towel. It needed to be cleaned with heavy duty special mildew cleaner and was not. Also the shower door did not properly close but this was fixed. The broader question is why is the housekeeping staff so bad that these issues are not reported and dealt with before the guest has to complain. In addition, the exterior was very grimy and gross. It is desperately in need of a power wash and re-painting. Lastly, my Marriott profile clearly indicated that I should get the Wall Street Journal but the only thing supplied was the local paper, obviously to save money. I did not bother complaining because I was able to read the WSJ electronically. The hotel had virtually no activities for children or adults. Note the uploaded image (this is not copyrighted) of the August 1, 2011 activity schedule. As it may be hard to read, I will mention ALL of the daily activities listed. They consisted of yoga (for a fee), personal fitness training (for a fee), use of a basketball and court (free), zumba (free), a tennis clinic (free, but probably geared towards making you spend money on the courts or something else), Reef and Ray Adventure (for a fee) and Keiki Marine Life Program (for a fee). Contrast this with kids and adult activities at many other JWs such as water slides, water aerobics, bounce house, tie dye t shirts, face painting, hair braiding, s\u2019mores, science experiments, camp fires, sing alongs, ice cream making, etc. etc. The pool is very lame and is just a round circle. There are no children\u2019s water activities such as a water slide or lazy river. It was impossible to get to use the fitness equipment as the fitness center is way too small for the size of the hotel. The concierge is the most outrageous aspect of all about this hotel. In my opinion, a concierge should be a hotel employee whose job it is to help guests with directions, site seeing, restaurant recommendations, etc. Of course, they may from time to time earn a small commission but their main job should be to help the guests. Here the concierge is not even a hotel employee but an outsourced company called Expedia Local. All they care about is booking tours for you so they and the hotel can get their kickbacks. In fact the concierge herself is compensated based on the value of what she sells and only gets her commission if she hits a certain daily threshold. The incentive system that this creates is that the concierge has no interest in helping you at all. The funny thing is that they take the money and then pay the suppliers (probably taking 20-40% for themselves and keeping the money as long as possible before paying). Just understand this twisted incentive system before you book anything. The very few positives I can say are as follows: *F&B was excellent and priced fairly. The Azul restaurant was especially good. *Valet parking staff was friendly, always had towels ready and very helpful with directions. *The room view is beautiful if you have an oceanfront. If my feedback has one thing in common is that the ownership of this hotel does not care about offering great service at a fair price. What they care about is investing as little as possible and fleecing their clients for as much as possible.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with private cove\u201d", "Author": "Allie B", "ReviewID": "UR116135074", "Content": "Had a great time at the JW.

We arrived at about 6:30 p.m. and went straight to the desk to check in. There was one person up there already and one of the other employees called us up promptly. Check in was smooth and courteous. They knew we were there for my birthday and didn\u2019t offer any sort of upgrade which was a little disappointing but hey, that\u2019s ok. We ended up in room 620 with a West facing beach view. You could see the parking lot but it wasn\u2019t annoying, I just made sure to shoot up and keep it out of my images. Room was nice. Smaller than we expected. Bathroom was a nice size with a private water closet, glassed in shower, his and hers vanities and a large separate tub. Tub is only big enough for one person. Shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The bed was comfortable but the bottom sheet was not fitted and as soon as you laid down it was fully untucked and it gathered around you throughout the night. I detest hotels that do this. Either invest in sheets that fit the bed or find a way to tuck it so it stays TUCKED! There is nothing worse than having your linens twist up and roll up around you so you are touching the mattress when you sleep. In the morning as I was straightening out the linens, I also noticed that there were 3-4 small but noticeable holes in the bottom sheet. This is something housekeeping should have noticed when making it up and replaced it. One thing I also noticed was that there was a mattress cover on the bed and when you turned in the bed the sound of that cover moving around against the mattress was very loud. I think another reviewer said something about \u201csleeping on a plastic bed cover\u201d and that is about what it sounds like, but it\u2019s not plastic. Not sure what the solution there is unless they add a pad between the cover and the mattress. The ac (which is controlled with your bedside control system) never really seemed to cool the room fully. We had it down to 68 degrees and it was more like 75 in there. Having a feather comforter with that made it a bit warm especially for DH who is a large man and gets hot easily. We tried turning on the ceiling fan but it sounded like it was going to fall off the ceiling so that was a no go. Couldn\u2019t open the door to add a little fresh air while you slept because that shut off the AC system. The bedside control unit allows you to turn lights off and on from your bed, set the \u201cDo not Disturb\u201d light, and again, the AC temp. Nice touch to give the room a more techy feel. Internet access. Free wifi if you want to hang out in the lobby. In the room you pay. No thanks. As much as you pay for a room, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for something that any joe off the street can get by sitting in your lobby and having a cup of coffee \u2639. Other than that the room was clean but it did show some signs of wear. It\u2019s an older hotel so that\u2019s going to happen. It really didn\u2019t detract from our enjoyment. The grounds are beautiful and worth walking around. There is a nice pathway that leads to the beach to the right of the hotel with the hotel behind you. The ponds with the fish and other assorted sea life was nice. I did see where other viewers mentioned about it looking a bit murky but I did not notice any bad odors. Everything in the tank seemed lively. The design of the hotel is just lovely and you could tell that it was once a very grand property. It reminded me of some of the places in Barbados. The pool and lagoon were very lovely. It never seemed crowded at all. DH arranged a special dinner for me in our room. Our server was very prompt and delivered the food right at 7pm. We were able to enjoy a nice meal while watching the sunset. We had personalized menu cards and mine said happy birthday with my name and the date. The food was beautifully presented but since it was all brought and set out at once you either had to eat fast or be prepared to eat a cold dinner. You can pay to have a private server but that costs extra, just like the candle they add to your table, etc. When he told me he had to pay for the candle I was a bit surprised. That should come with the romantic dinner. Only other negative review I can give is that the two cocktails that he ordered (Amaretto Sours) were in small tumblers and the glass was only half full. It certainly left you wanting more. I got up in the am and wasn\u2019t sleepy so I grabbed my camera and went for a walk around the grounds and down to the beach. The beach is just lovely. I wish I had brought my suit. There are plenty of chairs or \u201cCabanas\u201d that you can rent and the water looked really inviting. On the way back up to the room I stopped at the coffee shop and got two muffins, a large mocha with an extra shot of espresso and a bottle of OJ for DH. That set me back $19.40! OUCH. Room service for breakfast was prompt and our server was very sweet and personable. She pushed the cart to the Lanai and set everything up. DH had the Steak and eggs and I had the Banana Mac Nut pancakes. Three pancakes\u2026too much. He also ordered a side of breakfast potatoes that were a bit over cooked (not burnt but just hard). It was nice just to sit on our lanai and enjoy our meal so no complaints there. Had to fight the birds off a couple times after we were done because they REALLY liked the pancakes. Time to check out. That went smooth. There were a couple people in front of us but it only took a second to get up to the counter to check out. I let them know about the fan so hopefully they will deal with it like they promised so the next visitor won\u2019t have that problem. I probably should have mentioned the AC but I forgot. Well, the day wasn\u2019t over. He got the spa package room so even though our massage wasn\u2019t until 12:00 we dropped our bags with the bellman to be secured and walked across the street to the spa. We were promptly and pleasantly greeted (complete with Happy Birthday) and escorted to our respective locker rooms. Once I was changed I was given a tour of the facility and set off to enjoy some of the amenities while I waited. There is a hot tub and a cold plunge pool right next to it, a steam room, sauna and \u201cneedle\u201d shower that is essentially a shower booth that has shower jets that hit you from all angles around it. Very nice. I used it all while I waited for our couples massage. The room for our massage was a long narrow room and our tables were head to head. The massage was about an hour and mine was perfect. She listened to my requests and perfectly executed them. DH seemed to enjoy his but at one point he had to ask her to lighten a bit. Not sure why massage therapists like to push the muscle into the bone but sometimes that HURTS. When our massage was over we were guided back to our lockers and told that we could stay and enjoy until 7pm or come back if we wanted to. As nice as that would have been we had a wedding to attend so off we went. Had a shower and got ready. Few things I noticed. No razors or sanitary items which I\u2019ve seen in every other spa I\u2019ve been to. There are two hair dryers so if there are more than two ladies drying hair, you will have to wait. They provide shampoo, conditioner and shower gel. I wish I had brought my stuff because my hair is color treated and it didn\u2019t like their products. They also had some mousse, hair spray, spray deodorant and lotion. Oh and lots of towels and iced towels that were very nice when you were in the steam and hot tub. So this concludes my trip report. Over all it was a nice weekend. I loved the spa, and have to say I liked it much better than Turtle Bay\u2019s spa. More amenities to enjoy, but same wonderful service. I probably wouldn\u2019t stay there again, just because of the bed and the AC issue. My own bed and AC are much better and not that far from there. It was nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu and it really felt like a tropical paradise. On a noise note: Construction a the new Disney property was still going on but we really didn\u2019t notice anything until we were leaving and could hear the \u201cbeep beep beep\u201d people complained about but it really wasn\u2019t that bad. If you want peace, quiet (aside from the soon to be over construction) this is a great place for you.

I noticed that the Disney resort plans to open this fall, this will create an extremely busy beach, probably a great place for families with kids, but not really for couples.

It costs an additional $14.00 USD per day. - Expect to pay $35.00 USD per day for parking (you are able to either valet your car - don't forget to tip - or simply drive your car to the parking garage - which is about 20 steps from the entrance of the hotel.) - If you misplace a towel (or the individuals working at the towel station forget to mark it off on your sheet as returned) the hotel automatically adds a charge of $20.00 per towel to your bill (so make sure to check your bill prior to checking out) - Expect to pay higher prices for meals at the hotel restaurants. Just to get a slight feel for it - the breakfast buffet is approx. $24.00 per person whereas the brunch buffet is approx. $47.00 per person (which includes a 'complimentary' glass of champagne) - however they are served at the same time (so make sure to read the signs and take the food from the appropriate buffet tables) - The food at the hotel restaurants is delicious though - and the staff is wonderful! - Unfortunately we didn't find this out until two days before we left, but there is a store in the brand new plaza directly across the road from the hotel called ABC - and it is amazing!!!! It has extremely fair prices, great fresh food (including made-to-order salads, amazing sandwiches, hot food etc etc etc), souvenirs, sunscreen, snorkeling equipment, alcohol .... I could go on and on - Within that new plaza there are also 2 restaurants. We ate at the Mexican restaurant (I believe it was called \"Just Taco's\") and the food was great, however our waiter was terrible! By far the worst service I think we have ever received at a restaurant. We figured that perhaps we was simply having a bad night. :) - Otherwise, within that plaza there is also an ice cream shop - which we heard was amazing, however we never actually made it in there. There are several empty shops just waiting to be filled with new stores and restaurants - and I would guess that once the Disney Hotel is up and running (which is directly across from the JW Marriott), they should be occupied with more fun things for you to enjoy! All-in-all it was a very lovely stay and we would def go back and recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious and lovely\u201d", "Author": "Travelot80", "ReviewID": "UR115342214", "Content": "We stayed at the Ihilani Resort for our 10th anniversary and it was a perfect location.

Our only goal was to rest, relax, and unwind as this was the first time in a long time we would be on our own, without kids. We have stayed at many JW Marriotts and this one does not meet expectations. In addition, there is MAJOR construction still going on next door AND at the lagoon/pool area, with noisy jackhammering and tractors beeping and bellowing as they endlessly go back and forth doing who knows what. We are FURIOUS that there was not a mention about the construction and noise on the website or from the concierge during our many months of planning this trip and corresponding with the hotel. Had we at least known there would be all this noise and disarray, we could have made other plans or at least prepared ourselves for it not being peaceful. As far as the hotel itself - It is small, with dusty plastic plants decorating the hotel floors, an extremely dirty overhead concrete entry way COVERED in bird poop, scuffed walls, and a strange outdated glass floral arrangement in the entry revolving door. There is also barely anywhere to sit in the lobby. NOT luxury AT ALL. We have found most JW's to at least give somewhat of a similar experience to a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons, as its brand promises, but this hotel was more like a high end Hampton Inn. If you haven't stayed in true luxury hotels, you might find this hotel to be acceptable, but if you've experienced a well maintained luxury hotel, you WILL be disappointed. The only positive about our 1 night stay (we aborted the whole trip and flew to Maui the next day and stayed at the Grand Wailea) was that our ocean view room had a nice view. Other than that, the room was small, barren, had an 80s cathode ray tube TV (aka, not flat screen) and was MISSING FURNITURE. It took 3 tries in talking to the front desk to CONVINCE them that our room was missing the seating area furniture (2 chairs, table, ottoman). We ended up having to find a Google image online of what an ocean view room looked like at this hotel and took it to the front desk to PROVE that the room was missing seating. Yes, we raised all of these issues to the hotel's GM and while we did get a call back from him some many hours into the second day, he just didn't really care a whole lot about our problems with the noise, not being told beforehand about the noise, and the missing furniture. However, we were treated nicely by the pool towel attendant and we received some complimentary fruit, but this just wasn't going to cut it from what we expected of a JW Marriott. So, as we sat at the lagoon on the second day, trying to convince ourselves it would be ok, watching the tractors go back and forth and listening to the jackhammering and the neverending BEEPING of construction vehicles backing up, we packed up, cancelled the rest of our stay, and flew to Maui for the rest of the week. What a HUGE inconvenience AND disappointment. Thankfully, it turned out great at the Grand Wailea. The sad part is that we might have been able to salvage something of the JW visit, had the staff or at LEAST the GM cared a lick about our experience. How about comping the first night or free breakfast during the stay or an upgrade to a room with FURNITURE?!?! This is a classic example of how a bad situation could have at least been slightly mitigated by the attention of staff and management. So, from the deteriorated facilities, to the construction noise we weren't told about, to the apathetic attitude of the GM, this hotel is just not up to JW Marriott standards and we highly recommend you don't visit there, ESPECIALLY with Disney central going in next door.

We came back to Honolulu to make the trip open easier. We did not use the beach or the pool. If I had come here to use the beach I would have been extremely disappointed.

The master bedroom in the suite had it's own private balcony and provided good privacy but did not have a lock on the door.

Some folks have commented that they found the children in the hotel a bit noisy. We did hear kids, but it was the most pleasant sound of little gleeful screams of kids splashing about with their siblings and parents detached from their televisions and I-pods. A refreshing sound and sight to see families connected like this. We rented a car and did a few excursions to see the rest of the Island. The valet team were the best!

Pros: The hotel is gorgeous! It was recently renovated, and the lobby, the rooms--everything is really lovely. It's got a nice pool--not too big (seating can be a problem) but the perfect temperature. Note: it's a salt water pool! The beach area is gorgeous also--it seems to be a manmade lagoon, so no worries about the waves or currents. The breakfast buffet is delicious, and we ate a couple meals from the pool bar, and the sandwiches were really super! Cons: the staff friendliness is sort of hit or miss-- no one was horrible, but when I called to confirm the reservation, the phone people were a bit abrupt. When we were onsite, the pool attendant, bartenders, everyone we interacted with were super. As it typical of a hotel, the food and drink prices were pretty high. This is NOT an all inclusive (maybe they have a meal plan or something, but we weren't on it) so a frozen drink by the pool was almost $15 usd. It was a great drink, but still. Also, the beach didn't have umbrellas or those permanent shade spots. If you wanted shade, you had to bring your own (there's an ABC store across the street) or RENT a lounger. The price for parking is about $30 a day, so take that into consideration when renting a car. However, the resort is quite far from other Oahu activities (like Pearl Harbor, downtown Waikiki and Honolulu, North Shore, PCC, Pali lookout...) so having a rental car is still probably a good idea. I don't golf, but I heard the golf course (that you ARE near) is great. There's also a Disney resort (not a theme park, just a hotel) going in next door--that should be fun for a visit. Finally-- while the rooms were renovated, they put in this very elaborate control system-- I had some trouble getting the a/c to cool down enough, so I ran the ceiling fan (which was a bit squeaky).

After spending one night at Halekulani in Honolulu, we realized we needed something more relaxing and serene. Since we were coming from NYC, staying in Honolulu didn't feel as relaxing as we were looking forward to. We weren't getting the open island feeling and didn't want to wait to get to our next island. We drove to the west of Oahu the next day and checked into Marriott Ihilani. At half the cost of Halekulani, Ihilani was perfect for us. The property is beautiful. A more relaxed, less hectic hotel than Halekulani. The beach is a series of 4 lagoons (man-made). The views from the rooms are expansive and lovely. The hotel and rooms are pleasant, good quality, and well kept. The rooms and lanais are spacious. We stayed in the hotel. There's a path for walking/jogging that takes you along the different lagoons to Marriott's time share property at the other end. If you go in the other direction, behind the hotel, you find a smaller beach stretch, which is an amazing spot for sunsets and quiet picnics. The food was quite good. We ate mostly poolside or Naupaka Terrace. One evening we ate at Azul, which was amazing. Another evening we drove to Honolulu for dinner. The time share buildings also have two restaurants to choose from. The one annoyance was the massive construction project next door to the hotel. It was loud during the early part of the day so sitting on the beach was not as relaxing, not to mention is was quite an eyesore. You hear less noise if you're poolside. At that point, the beach felt quiet and low key, but with such a massive hotel going up in such a small space, it's going to get pretty crowded on the beach once it's open. Perfect for anyone who wants to stay in Oahu for a night or more before going off to other islands, have a relaxing island experience, and not get stuck in the busy city area of Honolulu. We did like Honolulu, but preferred it after a few days of relaxing quiet. So maybe next time, we'll go there for a couple of days at the end of our visit. Overall, a great part of our trip.

There were also quite a lot of families there with very young children. Although they were precious to watch, it set a different tone to the trip. We rented a car for the entire period we were there, but we wouldn't do it again because of the $30/night hotel charge for the parking. Honestly, we took two days to do trips and the rest of the time we spent close to the hotel. Traffic into and out of Honolulu is horrific--much like the juggernauts we're used to back home. We opted not to go into the \"city\" for dining for that reason and would have just rented from Hertz--at the hotel--for the two days we needed and taken a cab to and from the airport. Yes, cabs are pricey, but we would've still saved quite a bit not having the car at the hotel all those days we weren't using it. Restaurants were pretty good. Roy's was the best ever. Chucks Steakhouse was good too, located at the Beach Club. There's a shuttle that can take you anywhere in the resort area to dine, which makes it pretty convenient. Be prepared to drop some money on dinners--An average of $150 to $200 for drinks, apps, entrees and dessert. We also did dinner casually a few nights in the bar at the JW--they will offer you any menu from the in house restaurants to order from there. On leaving, one tip. Ask your airline what is the earliest you can check in. Some airline counters aren't open until just before flights leave so you could be stuck waiting at the counter area for quite a while at the airport (we waiting two hours). Would we go back?

It was a pleasant surprise to find that this is a drier side of Oahu, as the eastern side of the island was extremely windy and much colder. However the hotel is quite far from the center of Honolulu, and a rental car is a must. You will want to drive to have more choice for resaturants and do some shopping for snacks/drinks etc. There is a town a few minutes away, but somewhat tricky to get to because of road construction and some closure/detours for the exit ramps. Also there is an outlet shopping mall within 15 minutes or so if you are into that sort of thing. The downside of having the car has been mentioned in practially every other review, which is the $29 nightly charge. Very annoying added cost.

Very reliable, somewhat bland, but overall good without any major surprises (good or bad). I traveled with husband and 22-month old twins. We stayed on Marriott points, but if I had paid myself I am not sure if this is necessarily the property I would have chosen as I don't know what rates folks paid for comparable rooms. A colleague with young kids recommended this hotel to us. Overall we had a gerat experience. The good: - Fantastic and friendly staff. But then again, everyone is friendly on Oahu. I give the staff an A+. - Check in and room available right away at 12:30 pm, no waiting around until 3 pm. - Renovated room and extremely clean. We are a messy family with the twins and our room always looked impeccable. Housekeeping did a marvelous job and came promptly when called if we opted out earlier in the day, if we weren't ready. A+. - Empty mini refrigerator in the room and small pantry like area to use. Awesome for kids. We kept milk, fruit, orange juice etc in there. And some beer for ourselves! - Lagoon beaches are great for kids and not crowded with limited access to the public. It truly felt like a private beach any time of the day. The hotel will share the lagoon with the Disney resort going up next door, so it might get crowded when the Disney guests come along in late 2011, but there are 3 other lagoons further away also available. - Good (but expensive) restaurants. Nachos at the pool side bar was nothing to write home about, but when you enjoy them together with happy kids and washed down with a beer, life still feels pretty good. - Great inexpensive Hawaiian BBQ place across the main street and a handy little convenience store. - Great fish ponds, again awesome for young kids. - Great walking paths. - The hotel had 90% occupancy when we were there over the Holidays and still felt small and uncrowded. Mixed guests, some families with young and older kids, some older couples, younger couples, friends traveling together. Very low-key, just the way I like it. - The Kapolei community a few miles up the freeway with a Target, Safeway a few restaurants (AWESOME breakfast place, KOA Pancake house. Not to be missed, even in its strip mall location). Very new and mainland like, but utilized almost daily with us since we have young kids (diapers, baby food etc). The not so good: - The Disney construction across the street. Who said it is almost complete? Wrong! Construction is going full blown with (I counted) 12 cranes, dump trucks, back hoes, bull dozers etc. The site is CLOSE, but I don't think rooms facing the pool side will hear much. We stayed on Marriott points (platinum) and expected the construction based on other reviews here, so it was not a surprise when we got a room facing it (\"mountain view\"). But, beggars can't be choosers and for us it was actually a great location since our kids LOVE big machines. We were up on the 9th floor and had a full view of the site. Also, we had no neighbors on one side and a neighbor with a bigger living room facing our bedroom on the other side, so our kids, who were quite noisy at times, hopefully did not bother too many other guests. If I was a honeymooner, I'd probably take issue with the room location and construction, especially since it is not mentioned on the Marriott website. - The pool. It is not heated and was actually COLD. My kids who take baby swim lesson did not enjoy it. This was a huge disappointment since we had planned to do a lot of pool time with them. If you are older, I don't think you will mind, but my little ones would not have it. - The location in Ko Olina. As others have mentioned, it IS far away from stuff (with the exception of the strip malls in Kapolei). We expected this, but Ko Olina is also pretty close to an industrial area and, if continuing north, some very sad and poor neighborhoods. We were there over New Year's and they supposedly have an awesome New Year's celebration with great fireworks. With young kids, we were in bed by 9 pm and missed the party. We were glad our room faced away from the pool where the party was going on. We were woken up at midnight by the fireworks (which we heard but could not see). The kids slept right through it. It sounded like some BIG stuff and ohhh I was itching to go down to the beach, but parenthood was calling. I am sure it was fabulous! I guess one year they even had Sheryl Crowe perform on the beach. Yes, they charge for parking, $29/day. I don't understand why this is a surprise to so many reviewers. That's what hotels do. Good thing is that you can valet parking anytime at no extra charge and that was perfect one night during a rain storm and at times when we came home with sleeping kids and just wanted to get in the door.

There were also no moderately priced restaurants on the premises. Fees for recreational activities on site during the day were offputting. 3) Inconveniently remote - This hotel is too far removed from restaurants, stores, and attractions. Maybe in a few years there will be additional conveniences around to supplement daily needs. 4) Limited pool options - There is one large circular pool. It's pretty, but only about 4.5' deep at center. There is also a hot tub. 5) Excessive sales pitch for the Marriott timeshare down the street - I came to vacation, not to enter into a real estate transaction. One or two mentions of this opportunity is acceptable, however the marketing is a bit thick. 6) Furniture seemed worn and sparse - In both rooms I had , the mini fridge was on the floor with no cabinet or stand. The first room I was given had a large living room with only a couch, end table and lamp, and TV cabinet. While this was nice, the room seemed pretty empty. Also, the electronic lighting and TV control next to the bed didn't work correctly in either room I had.

When I say get away from it all, I mean it is far from hustle and bustle of Waikiki. You will notice a significant number guests who are above 60. Parking is a serious bummer....it's $30 a night whether you valet or park yourself. Makes it very difficult to want to tip. The valet is convenient, but you ought to have the option. The pool is truly designed for the non-swimmer, over 60's and little kids. It is nice, but small. As regards the \"beach\"....well, it is man made and well....it is okay. Let's just say, if you (like us) are used to picturesque beaches....sorry, this is not it. The rooms are nice....obviously you want the ocean view. If you can get any of the rooms that ends in 08 or 09 (like 608/609 up to 1108/1109 and above) you wll get a nice view of the pool area and the \"beach\"/ocean. You may have to pay more for those views unless you are a Platiinum elite/premier, then you may get upgraded.......oh, but that $30 parking!! Now....the bathrooms are fantastic....and the housekeeping does a good job of putting back together the incredible mess we generally make. Did not mind tipping here (oh but that $30 parking) The buffett was an assault on our intelligence. If the parking does not drive you crazy, the buffett will. It is in the range of $60 for adults and about $25 for kids and it was not even better than a $11 Golden Corral (for all you \"All you can eat\" folks out there). The Prime Rib was great, but for that amount, we expected a great selection of fishes....but....what can I say, they fell seriously short there. To the credit of the hotel, they do provide a list of local restaurants where you can go...and our recommendation is: Hapa Grill.... You can get breakfast, lunch and Dinner. There is also Juliez Restaurant which seems to be a Vietnamese/Hawain deal. For these ventures, You will need a car (rental). You could cab/shuttle it, but these jaunts could add up fast. Now, if you live in a world where finances is not an issue.....this hotel is actually ok. The food is good, you will love the convenience of the valet parking, it is quiet and the beaches are not packed with all kinds of \"riff raff\".

Maybe January all the others come to stay....I dunno!! The rooms (and the bathroom...wow) are nice and the Service is actually pretty good....like anything, it goes both ways, if you are good customer (and/or you tip very well), the service will be off the chart. Will I go back? Drumroll....yes, but only as a points customer because I am a Marrioter. While I have paid similar rack rate of $295 - $300 for hotels, I did not see that for this hotel. This should be a high 5 rating not a 7 rating.

As stated in another review, the pigeon problem is major and shows in the off-color white of the hotel, and the area by what should be the amazing pond is covered in pigeon waste. While most of the pond was very nice, the part furthest from the lobby was covered in a murky film and bubbles. I'm not sure if that was a result of the JW's own renovations, and maybe they have not done much cleanup yet. I felt really bad for the fish that were in that area. Once in the room, looking outside over the deserted pool (3 people at 4pm) was disappointing. Most of what you saw was the construction of the Disney resort next door. I understand that all resorts are built at one point or another, but the lack of communication by JW was a bad move. All you heard in daylight hours was construction noise mixed with the sound of the waves, and that was also the very first thing you would hear at 7am. When I go on vacation, I expect to wake up later than I do at home, not earlier! Night time in the hot tub was probably the best part.. Oh but wait.. JW conveniently placed a bright white interrogation light on top of the hotel aiming right at the hot tub & the beach! There is NOTHING to do in the area.

We were upgraded to an Ocean View room and enjoyed our balcony overlooking the pool, lagoon, and ocean. Location: I have read reviews here stating the location is not good. I do not agree. The area is peaceful, grounds are beautiful, and views are spectacular. There are 4 lagoons- we swam in all of them but both agreed we liked the one right in front of the Ihilani the best. Crystal clear water, nice sand. We drove all over Oahu and swam at other beaches and ALWAYS liked returning back to the serenity of the JW Marriott lagoon. Waikiki beaches were dirty and ugly and full of homeless people. Ko Olina lagoons were all perfect, clean and not over-populated. There is no real nightlife, but we were there to relax. We had a rental car and took day trips to the Dole Pineapple Plantation, Northshore, Waikiki, Hanauma Bay Preserve, USS Arizona, Turtle Bay, and the Sacred Birthing Stones from Ihilani. At night, we had dinner and relaxed by pool. We are from the East Coast and there is a 6 hour time difference, so we were up early and went to bed by 10PM each evening. Activities: Pool is not huge, but was nice and had plenty of lounge chairs around it. The hotel always had fresh beach towels and ice cold water available at the towel stand. The pool bar was great (a little pricey, but it is a resort in Hawaii). I recommend trying a Mai Tai or Ihilani Dream served in a frozen pineapple. We swam every day in the pool and in the lagoon. We took a 4 hour snorkel trip from Ko Olina Marina which included a sightseeing boat ride up the coast, lunch, snorkeling, and a professional photographer on board who recording our trip on DVD ($45 for the DVD, but worth it). We also enjoyed snorkeling in the lagoon right in front of the hotel- the turtles are fun to see. We had our own snorkel gear, but you can rent gear at a stand on the beach and Ihilani guests get 1 hour of free gear per day. We also really enjoyed snorkeling in Hanauma Bay Preserve. We walked along the 3 mile paved path everyday. Watched sunsets from the rocks to the right of the hotel. One evening, we signed out Scrabble from the concierge. Food: We were very disappointed that Azul was not open the night of our anniversary. It's closed Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday due to low occupancy in the non-peak season. It looked like the perfect romantic restaurant. We ate at Roy's on the golf course instead. It was outstanding food, but not the same atmosphere Azul would have provided. We also enjoyed room service for breakfast 3 X. The staff set up the table on our balcony one morning for a tasty breakfast with wonderful view. The coffee shop in the lobby has great turkey and cheese croisants and we stopped there for a \"breakfast to go\" 2 mornings before heading out for an adventure. The restaurant next to the pool (forget the name) had average, all-day type of food. I enjoyed the appetizers better than the main course. We went to Kona Brewery at the bottom of the hill from Hanauma Bay Preserve and tried some Shrimp Scampi and rice from a shrimp truck in the Northshore region. Both were excellent. Room: Recieved a Platinum Rewards Member room upgrade to Ocean View room. All rooms have spacious balconies and most look to have nice views. The Mountain View rooms are probably the least desirable views. We could see the new Disney Vacation Club Hotel construction, but it didn't distract us. Our room was clean. The tub was stained just due to age, but it was clean. The carpet in our room was fine, the carpet in the hall way dated, but by no means bad. Shower stall was spacious, complimentary soap, shampoo and lotion delightful, and having 2 vanities with sinks was convenient. Parking: Yes, $30 a day is steep and I think it should be included with the cost of staying at the resort. The parking deck was very close to the hotel and it was easy to self park and walk. Luau: We went to Fia Fia held right on the lawn at the Ihilani. Lots of fun and entertainment with fabulous food. Well worth $90 a person.

Despite our mediocre stay with a few negatives, they were hardly enough to disrupt our enjoyment of Oahu. This property is simply fine, very little to complain about.

Exellent toiletries. \u00b7Location: For us the location was perfect. It\u2019s located in Ko Olina, a masterplanned gated community on the far south-west of Oahu. Far and away from the madness and tourists of Waikiki. However, it is at least a 30min drive, in good traffic, to Honolulu. NEGATIVES \u00b7Pool: I came to Hawaii for the beaches so I didn\u2019t understand why the pool was more crowded than the beach but regardless it was quite depressing. It\u2019s simply an oversized circular pool with a flower painted along the bottom. Definitely not special. \u00b7Parking: One of the largest disappointments is the $30/day charge for parking. This is simply absurd. Again, not very JW of them... \u00b7Noise: By far the biggest downside for me was the construction right next door of the Disney resort. Obviously, the JW has no control over that but they should have a notice on their website. It was downright impossible to enjoy yourself on the beach with the noise of cranes, sirens, jackhammers and drills going all day long! \u00b7The Beach: Although it\u2019s great this resort is located right on the beach, this beach definitely wouldn\u2019t win any \u2018best of\u2019 awards. The beach is entirely artifical and it shows. There are hardly any fish or marine life. It is encircled by cement/rock blocks and the water is far from clear.

Not only that but it felt like they were family. The deluxe ocean view room had amazing views over the pool, the man made lagoon with the ocean as the back drop. It really just made you want to get up that little bit earlier in the morning to step out on the balcony and take in the breath taking sights. The room was very comfortable. Sleeping was great and though the rooms need a bit of a lift, in no way did we think to ourselves this room was dirty or tacky. The room was spotless, spacious and the two bath basins and mirrors come in handy. The gardens are well maintained and the entire property is clean and classy. The concierge organised a dinner next to the hammer head shark pond that is out the front of their trademark restaurant AZUL. Let me just say this, i had spent near four months organising an engagement ring, rang hotel after hotel looking for someone who would be willing to help me with this and let me tell you the moment i spoke to JW Marriott i did not need to look any further. The dinner they set up for my self and my now fiancee was nothing more than spectacular and the food was delicious. Then to top it off the level of service provided by the waiter was too good to be true. He played along with the whole proposal and went well and truly above and beyond to make the night that extra bit special. He even shouted us dessert at the end. People complain about parking prices and that the rooms are old etc, the little things such as these are well and truly made up by the greatest staff in the world. Believe me, I have travelled to asia, europe, dubai, the U.S main land, all around Australia, stayed in some of the best hotels the world has to offer and I myself have high expectations. Not only were all my expectations met, but the experience that the JW Marriott gave to myself and my fiancee was beyond our wildest dreams. We have already said we will return for our honey moon.

The location: Hawaii has absolutely amazing beaches everywhere. And, there are plenty of places around them where you can find pretty much all conveniences. We found the location of this hotel to be rather inconvienient. First of all, the beach itself is manmade and that isn't really as pretty as many of the other beaches we went to. Second, there were very few restaurants around. The first night we arrived, we had to drive almost forty minutes for dinner to get some rather aweful food. I didn't help our cause, for sure, that we're vegetarians. However, we didn't have any such problems in other places we stayed at (Sheraton Maui or the hotels in Waikiki, Oahu). 2. The hotel is overdue for an upgrade. This is NOT JW / 5 star standard. The room we got was an upgaded one on a high floor and it had amazing views. It was also very roomy and airy. However, on the first glimpse, one could tell that this was a five star hotel probably in the 80s. Not now. There were signs of disrepair in the furniture and even the bathroom accessories (soaps that smelled 'soapy' in shiny golden tubes) were so 1980s. 3. And yes, like someone mentioned earlier, the 'industrial\" view of the port was not exactly as breathtaking as several other sights in Hawaii. We came to this hotel after a week in Maui (Sheraton Maui) and two days in Waikiki. Sheraton Maui was a wonderful, scenic and not-too-crowded resort. Waikiki was all the crowd and noise and fun it is known to be. JW Ihiliani, unfortunately, was neither.

My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the first of June/10 for 8 nights. JW has ( or at least did) have a reputation of a quality 5 star hotel. We stayed at the JW in Cancun and that was like staying at a Presidental Palace, this hotel appears to have been (along time ago) an Embassy Hotel at one time. At least Embassy Hotels have plants hanging on the interior floors. This hotel is overall dirty and needs a new facelift. Example: I believe we stayed on the 6th floor and in that hallway there was a 5 by 20 ft patch of carpet that wasn't even close to the existing carpet. It was like \"we need to repair this carpet so go down in the storage and just get any carpet to put here\". If a hotel wants to paint everything white it should at least make sure it is clean, our room which overlooked the pool area, was very dirty, mold in shower also. Ceiling fan made noise so we didn't use that. Plant stand on balcony had plants that were on their last leg. The balcony overlooked the unimpressive pool which was in need of power wash. At check in we attempted to upgrade to a \"quality ocean view\" from \"ocean view\" but was informed this wasn't possible (even though not many vistors were staying there-IMO). This hotel was booked through Orbitz so perhaps that had something to do with it. We had a car rental and were forced to pay the daily $18 daily parking fee, By the way if you do stay here you do need a car, it is away from everything. Next door hotel construction (Disney) is on going, but I didn't think this is a problem, but it will when it opens. There are several Marriott time shares close by that can \"share\" this pool and they do. I can only stand so many \"Daddy, daddy, watch me!!!\" We only had one experience at the pool bar and the bartender was more interested in watching the television than waiting on their vistors. I just can't believe anyone would have a favorable opinion of this hotel and experience. I have come to the belief that the favorable reviews are from employees of the hotel (general manager to employees: \"we're slow right now so go make some positive opinions about our hotel\". OR that there are PR companies that post these opinions. This is the first time I have ever made a post, I felt it is a requirement to let people know about this place.

ALL upscale hotels charge for parking (try San Francisco and check out those rates!)..I actually think that new hotel is a plus as it will offer additional restaurant choices within the area because if you stay a week, its eating either in the Ihilani or Roys (which we went to and was quite good but I didn't love the atmosphere).I would go back, as would my entire family, in a heartbeat.

I have to say that this is by far my least favorite hotel in the state. I stayed here because it was the place chosen for a family reunion, so it wasn't my decision. There is absolutely nothing good about this hotel. It is not located anywhere near Waikiki or any other place you may want to visit. The beach is a man made lagoon that has nothing special about it. It is located near some docks that provide an excellent \"industrial view\" but don't expect anything near tropical. Furthermore, currently there is a massive construction project underway for a Disney hotel about 200 yards from the Ihilani, and once that is opened I am sure the experiece will only be that much worse. The food at the hotel was abosuletly inedible; and way over priced. I am not a cheap traveller and I generally don't complain about prices, but I have had better meals at a Denny's or a cheap Vegas buffet than what I was forced to eat every morning for a ridiculous $29. We did order room service breakfast 1 morning, which was equally as bad and somehow cost $190 for 4 people! Lunches and dinners were equally as disgusting. I think it is reasonable to expect that when you order fish at a restaurant in Hawaii that charges about $25-30 an entree that the fish would be at least fresh. However, the fish and other foods were always far from fresh, had horrible textures, and had clearly been frozen for quite sometime prior to being served. The rooms are a little worn down, and the air conditioning never seemed to really work. On several occasions I woke up in the middle of the night due to the heat and was unable to turn the AC back on, so I had to use a ceiling fan that rattled so much when on that the noise was unbearable. The pool is nothing special. It is just a big circle with a flower painted on the bottom of it. The Hot Tub is pretty basic, but one day it was unusable because the heater was broken and it was heated to about 110 degrees. Service was pretty bad, no one at the hotel has any desire to impress you or even attempt to earn a tip. Bellman and valet parkers will just sit around the main entrance rather than offer to park your car or take your bags, which is absurd. The ONLY decent thing about this hotel is the gym, tennis courts and somewhat decent basketball court. The BBall court has some sort of soft padding on it so its not entirely functionaly. I'd guess that reason why this hotel has good athletic facilities is that these are the reminance of when the NFL Pro Bowlers used to stay there. Overall, this hotel is horrible and is a terrible value. There are so many better options not just on Oahu but on all the other islands as well, so I cannot even begin to understand why someone would choose to stay at the Ihilani. (PS no WiFi here.

If you're looking for something close to Waikiki this isn't for you. It's about a half ride by car but at the same time that's the great part. It keeps the place comfortably crowded and not overcrowded. The lagoons give you a great taste of the ocean without the rough surf and the big bonus there is that you can pretty much hear the ocean from any room in the hotel. We didn't sleep with the door closed a single night. The sushi restaurant is out of this world and the breakfast buffet (while a bit pricey) is worth every penny. Prices for everything seem pretty much on par with the rest of the island, however drinks are a little steep but the bartenders make sure each drink is worth it. The spa is one of the best around. I also highly recommend the stingray/shark encounter. It's an amazing experience and something not many places have. It's very informative and extremely hands on. The ambiance in every corner of the hotel is perfect for anyone looking to get away and especially for a romantic getaway. The atmosphere is rather quiet (very, very few children at the hotel - both times I've been there) which makes for a more relaxing trip. The rooms are very much well kept and very up to date. One inside tip I can give you is if you're like me and want to spend every possible minute at the beach and therefore take a red-eye back to the mainland, you still have a place to change/shower/freshen up, even after check-out. They have a few guest rooms which are set aside for that very reason. They're first-come first-served but if you ask about it the morning of your departure they'll help you schedule it.

Meaning that people come from different backgrounds and what's posh and luxurious to Joe The Plumber may not be suitable for Joe Montana. It's always a matter of perspective of both the person writing the review and the person reading the review. I feel that a better way for these review sites to do a better job would be to try and match the reviewer and reader tastes in some manner but that's just my 2 cents worth. I'm neither poor nor rich, I'm probably classified middle to upper middle class more due to the fact that my wife and I have no kids and can afford to do things like take nice vacations, drive nice vehicles, and eat at nice restaurants. So we do both have to work hard for a living and I do make a point of watching where my dollars are spent, but by no means would I be considered a penny pincher. Unfortunately for JW Marriott Ihilani the bar had been raised considerably since we had stayed 5 nights on Maui at the Four Seasons prior to our stay at Ihilani. With that experience fresh in our minds, it was hard for Marriott to compare. Let me explain each of my ratings. The room was very clean and the maids kept it clean while remaining unobtrusive. I had no issue with the cleanliness. The location of the resort has it's benefits and it's drawbacks. The benefit is that you are away from Waikiki and Honolulu and all of that traffic and noise. The downside is that it's a long drive to Waikiki and Honolulu restaurants, night life and shopping. If your idea of vacation includes lots of Mai Tai's at lots of different bars, then you may want to consider Waikiki. The restaurants at the resort are ok. There is Naupaka Terrace which is where the daily breakfast buffet is usually served and they have informal lunch and dinner as well. We only ate the daily breakfast buffet there and the food was good, the omelets and waffles exceptionally so...thank you Byron and Ray! We had eaten at Azul, the upscale restaurant at the resort, and Ushio Tei, the Japanese restaurant at the resort on previous trips and left both restaurants unimpressed so we had no intentions of eating at either of them on this trip. There is Roy's restaurant nearby at the golf course which we had dined at previously and had great meals so we had dinner there 2 of the 4 nights we were at the hotel and were not disappointed. The rooms are large and spacious, ours was an ocean view room at the end of the hotel on the 11th floor. We had a beautiful unobstructed view of the ocean out our sliding glass door. I had requested a room away from the pool since I didn't want to hear a lot of pool noise. However what I did have was a lot of noise from next door at Paradise Cove and their Luau and some wedding reception parties. That all ended early enough so as not to affect our ability to sleep. The rooms still have the older tube type tv's, no flat panels here and a limited number of channels. In room movies start at $12.99. The bed was very comfortable. This leaves Value and Service. I booked an Aloha Promotional Package code PRO on the Marriott website. This package included an ocean view room, breakfast for 2 daily, free internet daily, and 4th night free (website says 4th night will be credited at checkout) at a rate of $299 per night. So basically my 4 nights was going to cost me $897 plus tax and parking fees etc. Of course I was surprised when I had the express checkout slip under the door to see that I was being charged for all 4 nights. Well I wasn't really surprised, I was half expecting it because the very same thing happened to me before at this property 3 years ago. It almost seems as if they want you to get all caught up in the enjoyment of your vacation and then hectic morning of getting packed and to the airport that they hope you miss their \"mistake.\" So IF you get a package deal, the value CAN be good. But IF you pay rack rates, you're would NOT be getting a good value in my estimation. Thus \"Watch your P's & Q's. Keep an eye on what you're being charged here and make sure that you're getting everything you are supposed to get. And THAT kind of puts on one the defensive while on vacation and doesn't make it easy for you to relax if you're constantly having to worry about how you may be being taken advantage of. So while they fixed the billing problem when I brought it to their attention... that doesn't negate the fact that I had a $299 billing problem and had to bring it to their attention to begin with. It makes me wonder if they were truly sorry or just sorry they got caught with their hand in my wallet. I can't say that I'd recommend it to a friend because I don't know that I'd recommend it to myself to return. With Disney scheduled to open in the near future I can envision the lagoons filled with squealing kids. IF quiet and away from Waikiki is what I want next time I may give Turtle Bay or Kahala a try. If I'm willing to brave Waikiki maybe the Halekulani. After my stay I recieved an email request from Marriott that I fill out a survey form....I will now include a copy of my written survey response to Marriott............................... I booked a 4th night free package inclusive of breakfast, high speed internet, and a commemorative coin. Because of the many package options available to be booked via the website it can become very time consuming to determine which particular package provides the best value for possible travel dates. The morning of my checkout an express checkout slip had been placed under my door and did not reflect the 4th night free as being credited to the account. The website said the 4th night free would be adjusted at checkout. So this meant that I had to go to the front desk and request the adjustment be made which was an inconvenience. It would seem to me that the Marriott billing system would recognize what promotional packages people have booked and adjust the billings automatically. I guess it's too bad I don't live in a perfect world. I figured that while I was already at the front desk wasting my time, I would go ahead and ask for my \"commemorative coin\" since I did not receive it at check-in and was surprised to receive a \"Hawaii state quarter.\" Better than a sharp stick in the eye I suppose. As I mentioned previously the package included breakfast daily for 2. When I checked in I was given a card upon which is said that we would receive \"American\" breakfast buffet for two daily and that it was valued at $40 and included an 18% gratuity. Well this left me to question what exactly this was to pay for. The buffet prices are two tiered at this resort. First there is the \"cold\" breakfast items only which has a price of something like $16 per person and then there is the \"hot\" full breakfast buffet priced at $25 per person. There was no \"american\" buffet or breakfast or anything listed on the menu. Simple math tells me that 2 x $25 is $50 per person which is $10 more than what my voucher was supposedly good for. So when I first went to the buffet I told my server that we were on the breakfast package, showed him the voucher that said the value was up to $40 and pointed out that the hot buffet price was $50 and asked him what I was entitled to. He said that he understood my confusion but all he knew was that everyone on the breakfast plan got the full hot buffet at the $25 value, which was fine with me. So after the first breakfast we had I got the receipt and it was billed to my room for $53 or so. The second day I got the receipt and it was a $0 balance and I filled out my room information and signed it. The third day it was the $53 or so again. (Now I'm confused if the breakfast is supposed to be charged to the room then deleted at checkout or not charged at all in the first place) This all just illustrates that nobody seems to know what's what as far as your packages are concerned. It almost seems that it's Marriott's goal to create this air of confusion on purpose. Maybe the front desk clerk was wrong in writing the $40 value amount in? The promotional code on the website simply says free breakfast daily, it doesn't specify a dollar amount or what exactly that breakfast entails...i.e. hot, cold, or a croissant and glass of juice. I'm not complaining because I was underfed or don't feel that I got what I paid for....I'm complaining because of all of the confusion. Why put the paying customer in a position where they have to ask for clarification only to show that your staff at the hotel and/or restaurant is just as unsure as the customer? Simplify things, nobody wants to be left to wonder about the details. Having stayed at this property before, I knew of the breakfast buffet because I've had packages that have included it. It didn't occur to me that there were different levels of buffets, and our last day, Sunday it got even more confusing with items on the buffet labeled as \"brunch.\" My final bill did reflect all of the charges from the restaurant had been removed so I'm not complaining about that. This was my third stay at this property and a few things that shows a decline in service and amenities caught my attention. Previously the coffee lounge/pastry bar downstairs provided free Illy coffee. I think that was due to the fact that there were no coffee makers in the rooms at that time. Now there are coffee makers in the room, but really, nobody wants in the room coffee because water from the tap just doesn't taste right and the coffee is weak for the amount in the packets etc. Anyway I went down the first morning to get coffee from the pastry bar area only to find that the coffee was no longer free and was going to cost me over $8 for 2 large coffees....double what Starbucks charges. You have always charged for parking but I think $29 per night is quite excessive. We stayed 5 nights at the Four Seasons on Maui before coming to Ihilani and they only charged $20 per night to park. I can assure you that nothing about your property is as nice as what the Four Seasons Maui offers, not even your parking. It's almost as if you are isolated on a side of the island away from any other hotels with a captive audience and you are taking full advantage of it. Of course while the valet guy is getting my car I'm gritting my teeth because I'm already paying $29 per night and now I've got to tip this guy on top of it...the $29 per night just isn't enough is it? You would think that with all the cars parking there at $29 per night that you could afford to power wash the bird feces off of the tinted glass covering over the waiting area by valet. Or maybe clean the soot stains from the portico where the torches are. Not to mention the bird feces all over the windows by the elevators. And $13.95 per day for internet usage!?!?! I'm glad my package included free internet. Look you don't even have wireless internet in the rooms and your internet was rather slow. There used to be flowers and leis in the lobby for the women, there were none this time. The Naupaka Terrace was closed for breakfast 3 out of the 4 days we were there and the breakfast had been relocated to Azul. This venue doesn't seem to be large enough to accommodate all of the guests and it seemed that tables and chairs had been thrown in there with seats halfway sticking out into walk paths. What I didn't understand is how could Naupaka Terrace be open for dinner but not breakfast? It was just a minor inconvenience. I thought it was a nice touch to set up a timeshare stand at the steps from the pool leading down to the path the lagoons. This gave us a nice opportunity to be hassled by one of your timeshare people who wouldn't take \"no\" for an answer on our \"restful\" vacation. There seemed to be a lot fewer staff working at the hotel. The shops hours had changed and were less convenient. But you know all of these things, they were all conscious decisions on your managements part. I just didn't want you to think any of it went unnoticed. These reasons are why I feel that when I come to your property I'm being nickled and dimed at every opportunity, and I have to watch you like a hawk to ensure that I am not being taken advantage of and am getting what I paid for. I mean had I not caught the $299 error on the free night not being credited to my account on checkout would I have gotten a phone call from you expressing how sorry you were that I had overpaid? Was it an oversight on your part? I tend to doubt it because it's not the first time I've had issue with one of your packages and the price charged at checkout. Throw in some Disney and some lagoons full of screaming kids and urine and I seriously doubt I'll be back. I do want to thank you for sending me this survey in a timely manner so I could respond while these issues were still fresh in my mind. I think I'll go ahead and post a copy of this survey response on the trip advisor website as well to help others make informed decisions.

Lots of gorgeous art/sculptures here too! Nice pool with the lounge chairs, umbrellas etc. If you need these things be prepared to pay. Everything costs. Floating type device to use in the private lagoon (which by the way is beautiful) cost 18 dollars an hour! And of course there is the incessant obligatory tipping that comes with it...you get the picture. Right next door Disney is building a resort making this not so quiet or so private. Next to that is the Marriott resorts and timeshares. There are 4(?) lagoons and they did not seem too crowded at all. Very nice beach time! Lots of families of course. As with any hotel of this caliber, when you need to eat you have some on site options and be sure the bank account is padded. Hard to justify those prices for food thats is on some sort of bird sized portion control, but thats the way it goes. You can be trapped there with no other choices if you did not rent a vehicle. No free internet/Wi-FI. When I used the business center and some charges were incorrect, I was informed that it is not staffed on the weekends and there really wasn't anything they could do. Was a bit dissapointed with the inability to find peace or silence (however not the hotels fault)...I thought it would be quiet/resort like due to it's location away from hustle and bustle. Some things you might want to know if this is your thinking as well...There is a very popular Luau that takes place nightly a parking lot away. Attended this Luau and was fun indeed, but more like a show with Luau type food. Not too authentic and PRICEYYYYY! You could easily hear this noise resonating throughout the exterior of the hotel each and every evening. Also, hidden in the bushes in the back of the hotel right on the water is a makeshift \"campground\". This campground also has a stage setup of some sort where Saturday and Sunday evenings included a DJ or extremely LOUD top 40/techno/hard rock music blasting over any peaceful \"ocean sounds\" with many \"woohoos\" from the crowd. I did notice this all ended at 10pm however so there must be some rule there. As my room faced this campground I was able to witness the campers climb through the bushes to enter the hotel and use the bathrooms and such as well. From our lanai you heard tropical birds sing and our room had a breathtaking view of the ocean and grounds to the left. To the right, a massive parking lot stretching over to the Paradise Cove Luau where many buses deliver people during the evening. Too bad this is the location. Once at the resort without a car, be forewarned about transportation here...Taxis charge 70 - 80 dollars one way not including tip to airport. Our ride was 15 minutes for about 13 miles. Car service from hotel could offer the ride for 96 dollars. Hertz is the only onsite car rental option and charges 37 a day if you can return to car to the exact hotel location.

From check-in, to housekeeping (thanks for all the extra coffees & towels!!), to maintenance, to valet, to poolside & restaraunts, to the spa, to the concierge - - everyone we encountered was friendly, helpful, informative, and most of all, effiecient. Our ocean view room was huge, comfy, and best of all, really DID have a full ocean view! We were offered an upgrade to a Jr Suite at check-in and they allowed us to view both rooms before making a decision. Turns out, for us, there was no need. The Jr Suite we looked at was directly over the pool....great for some folks, but we were happier with our original reservation. The standard rooms are HUGE already, and our originally booked room was directly above the fish/ray ponds and waterfalls looking at nothing but trees and ocean from the balcony. So relaxing to start the day with a cup of coffee and that view. Room service was FAST, yummy, and average pricing (we all know you pay more for room service, right?).... had both breakfasts and a dinner - all perfect. The Sunset Grill was wonderful for dinner although not as impressive for lunch. The Poolside Bar & Grill however was the best of the bunch. Some wait time for service, so be patient - but the menu for lunch was a bit better than the Sunset Grill and you get the benefit of being at the beautiful pool with view of the private lagoon. Oh, their 'tropical' cocktails come in a frozen pineapple. A pretty gimick - but be warned, they start leaking when they thaw and get very sticky. We learned after the first drink to ask for ours in a regular glass. Drink prices are a bit on the high side - but again, as with room service, its a poolside bar on Oahu....... you're going to pay the premium. Housekeeping had some issues restocking washcloths and towels, but one quick call and 'POOF' extras were delivered almost before you could hang up the phone. The spa is beautiful, and pricey (of course). Massages were great after the long travel day getting to the islands. Note that for this location you will absolutely NEED a car for your trip - most attraction shuttles do not come out to Ko Olina and there are stores and restaurants just one exit up the highway where you can eat cheaper or stock up on room munchies and beverages to save some $$ too.

There is construction going on next door, but not on weekends or holidays. On the days we were there while they were working, we closed the lanai doors and it was like nothing was going on outside. I used the lap pool and hot tub several times. The pool was not crowded and always clean. Towels were provided and the people who worked at the spa and fitness center were also very friendly and helpful. It was very pleasant to walk around the lagoons in the early morning and evenings. A great place to go if you enjoy peace and quiet!

We could quickly get to the North Shore (which we did 3 times) or to Honolulu for shopping and dining. The grounds are gorgeous, with 4 man-made lagoons along the shoreline.

Swimming is great and I got to see fish underwater as well, which caught me by surprise. Try the Hawaiian pizza! The pineapple is just too good.

The WONDERFUL staff were MORE than happy to change us to a room we preferred at NO TROUBLE OR COST! It was such a lovely experience! Our room was modern, VERY spacious, HUGE double bathroom, two vanities, huge bath that our two yr old LOVED & a large shower & separate toilet which my husband LOVED! Our room wasn't ready as our flight was a 6am arrival. But we were offered a hospitality suite to relax & freshen up. The valet guys were SO nice! Very accommodating & friendly! The girls serving us at the pool were WONDERFUL especially Danielle who was at our beck & call basically. We barely noticed she was there but we were NEVER without a drink or food. She was SO friendly & super nice to us! It was what you would expect from a 5 star relaxing holiday. The pool attendants wouldn't just give you a towel they would also take it to your chairs & set the towels up for you! The cocktails were SO GOOD!!! The pool & lagoon are amazing. So spacious & relaxing. Not hectic & cramped like waikiki hotels. We travel to Hawaii EVERY year & this hotel is one of the best we have stayed at (spacious like Maui Resorts)! But beware, it is VERY QUITE & RELAXING here! There are NO SHOPS within walking distance. Just a small sundry/lobby shop with milk, water, beers, magazines etc... If you don't have a car you will use room service & the hotel restaurants. We have a needy two yr old & we were fine with the facilities available. If you have a NEED for shopping you can catch a taxi to the Waikele Outlets for $25. The outlets are a MUST SEE. VERY CHEAP!!!!! There is NO night life here either... Trust me you won;t need night life... It's SUPER relaxing!!!! There is construction next door, the Disney Hotel is being built. But we did NOT notice it at all. Only heard some beeping & saw some some cranes when we were on the beach. It is NOT a problem!!! The restaurants in the hotel open on alternate nights... so if you have a favorite it won;t be open two nights in a row. But it's not a problem. All of them are lovely. We loved the Japanese buffet.

At approximately 6AM, we were once again woken up by someone actually opening to door and only the latch kept the door closed. My wife who was livid at this point and went down to the front desk to complain about the night that we had. The front desk said that they would have security come inspect the lock to see what happened.

To make matters worse, security concluded that the 6AM entry was from the Housekeeping Supervisor who incorrectly read their paperwork and was trying to inspect the room.

The pictures look fantastic. The lobby is very nice and the concierge and Expedia local expert all were helpful. ROOMS: The registration girl did a good job and was very friendly. However, I was not impressed with my \"ocean front\" room as it looked out towards the Paradise Cove Luau (you can't actually see the luau, but you do see the parking lot for the luau!). The view did have some ocean view which is beautiful, but it also had the view of the parking lot! Not to my liking at all after paying a premium! Since it was late and we had reservations to go out that evening we took it up the next morning. The same girl was working at the registration and she had me look at a room to see if I liked it better. After going to the room, there was an air conditioning fix-it man in the room trying to fix the air conditioning (not a good sign!) and I kid you not, the room was actually only up one room (but on a different floor) from the room we had - so naturally, it also looked out on the same parking lot! I went back down to registration and said that room was unacceptable also and I wanted what I'd paid for - an ocean front/view room - upon which we were sent to look at the 3rd room and it did have a LOVELY view but also came with two double beds and not the KING we had requested. We did stay in that room, but needless to say, it was not as \"romantic\" as we would have liked it!!!! But the view was lovely and we made do with the bed situation. The bathroom was huge in the room, but did NOT have a whirlpool tub and just wasn't as luxurious as we have had in other resorts. Make sure you do not book on the side closest to the renovations being done at an adjacent property - I understand from the bell staff that Disney is building a hotel adjacent to the JW Marriot. The bathrooms could have been much more lux. The balconies were very nice but not overboard lux amenities. The bedding and mattresses were above average and were comfortable (yes, EACH of the beds!) LAGOON/SNORKELING: It was beautiful and nice beach. Had some okay/moderate snorkeling - nothing to rave about, as has been noted. The kayaking is a joke - we thought we could go out as we do in Cancun or Riviera Maya but it is just in the small lagoon! So we weren't interested in doing that little kid type kayaking! Would be fine for little kids I suppose. POOL: Nice, kept up well, sparkling clean. Nice, comfortable bar area and good food pool side - not too overpriced and fairly good. The Ceasar Salad had chunks of chicken and was huge - about $14 which was a bargain by this resorts prices! RESTAURANTS: Over priced buffet. I am not kidding - $25 breakfast buffet that is just a moderate buffet - nothing remarkable whatsoever. You can have the $17 fruit/cold only option but really just everything in the terrace restaurant is soooo overpriced. Breakfast would be about $45 each morning! The waitresses and hostesses were very nice. Efficient and quick service. Omelets were very good - but standard faire. All just the regular stuff and nothing really 5 star quality, in my opinion. SHOPPING ON SITE: Not much to choose from. The couple of shops I saw were Adequate, but pricey. Forgetaboutit! Not much fun shopping here! YOGA: Everyday was a different time! Didn't know what time it would be until that day's agenda came out (unless you stayed up late to pick it up from the front desk!). One day it was at 7:30 am, the next 5 pm, and then 9. Very confusing! Also, it was not free - cost about $12 each day! PARKING: $29 resort fee for parking a car on site, but highly recommend having your own car as you are out away from everything. Some might not want to get away fromt he resort, but I did not find it had enough activities or amenities to keep me staying there - so we were glad to have a car. The valets were wonderful, speedy and helpful. OVERALL: Just not that impressed that it was a 5 star resort. It was nice but just not the place that I had been looking forward to. I did not find it had the activities for a couple. I did see they had a wonderful kid's program each day so if you had children it might be a good place for you to stay. It did not have a \"sexy\" vibe at all! It did have a nice view from our 3rd room - and it was peaceful. The restaurants did not beckon! The activities did not beckon! I'd give it a solid 4 or 4.5 rating and probably would not stay here again. The spa was also very over priced but very nice.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville NC", "Title": "\u201cWOW, this is the life I want every day\u201d", "Author": "TexanXXL", "ReviewID": "UR47979023", "Content": "The experience was great.

The lswiming agoon is awesome. My wife didn't want to swim but sun bathed and read her novel the whole time which made her happy that there was towel service and assistance if needed. Several full service resturants are on property. It has full services to include a sundry store, jewlery store, and a great clothing shop where my wife bought necklaces as presents for everyone at home.

Check In was easy, and actually let me look at 2 rooms because I didn't think I like the first room we were assigned. The front desk staff was very friendly. We had a sunset view room, we could hear the waves and it felt a little more private. I did notice the furniture was looking a little more worn than it had on previous stays and the rooms could use some updating but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom very large. The construction next door was not an issue for us, the only time/place you can really see it is when you are on at the elevators. Yes, you can see the cranes from the lagoon but it was not at all intrusive. We usually got coffee in the morning from the lobby cafe and also the portions in Naupaka are large enought to share if you don't want a huge breakfast. We always go to Roys for dinner a couple of times while we are here, I was not real impressed with Azul in the past. The lobby bar has a good late night happy hour. The parking is overly expensive, we actually chose not to valet most of the time because the parking garage was not crowded and then we did not have to tip or wait for our car.. The location for me is a big plus, the lagoons are great for snorkeling, #2 usually has turtles. The N Shore is less than an hour away and you don't have to deal with the Waikiki crowds. I hope that the Disney resort will be pretty self contained with pools, etc so the folks staying there will not all end up at the lagoon.

The furniture in the living room could have been better, but it was fitting for the space and the island. The balcony is huge with plenty of room to order room service and have them set you up dinner out there (which they will). The entire side of the wall that connects to the balcony has white wooden doors that have wooden built-in blinds that you can open and close. The doors slide open and there are screen doors which open and then there are glass doors which open. You can have none, some, or all them opened or closed, and they all lock. It is nice to have the screen doors so you can close them and no creatures can get in, but still enjoy the outdoors- especially at night. We slept with the screen doors closed so we could hear the ocean and the ceiling fan on. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very spacious and clean with a nice walk-in shower, large bathtub, 2 sinks, and a seperate space with a door for the toilet. When you come in the room, there is a nice cabinet with a minifridge and drawers with a nice countertop and mirrors. The fan, lights, and a/c are all controlled on a touch screen phone by the bed as well as buttons that you may need to call anyone at the resort you may need to call. The service was great and they greeted you by your name when they answered. When you arrive, you will find a card in your room telling you they have a free gift for you from the vacation club. Go receive your free gift from the side desk and they will ask if you would like to go see their time-share property directly next door. If you go listen to the presentation that lasts 90 minutes you will get to attend the luau at the property next door for free or a dolphin cruise, snorkeling, or other activities. We did the free luau, Fia Fia, which was a $75 value a piece. It was amazing!! We enjoyed every second of it! There are NO strings attached; you have to listen to the presentation and thats it- no purchase, commitment, or anything necessary (I was very skeptical). The shuttle can take you there for the presentation and luau and bring you back which is great. There are several restaurants at the resort, at the gold club, and at the vacation club. The shuttle runs about every 30 minutes and will take you to any one of those. The lagoons are beautiful! There are 4 of them, so you can find one to enjoy. If you go toward the right side of the lagoon where the wedding place is set-up, just beyond the bushes you can exit the property onto land with rocks on the ocean. It is a quiet, beautiful place to watch the sunset with an amazing view of the mountains and the ocean with nothing in front of you. At the front desk, they keep a print out for you with all of the activities for that day and the next day. You do get 1 free hour of snorkeling and feed the fish is every morning. They have tiki umbrellas on the beach for you. You can rent a cabana they have set up for $20 that comes with cushions, a cooler, fruit, water, and a flag to raise for service including food/ drink service. The shops there and food is pricey. We didn't eat at the resort much because there are so many other great places to eat on the island. The parking is $30/ day which was pricey. They have valet parking also, so we never parked our car. The price is the same if you park or valet. Valet is easier because if you go to park, they have about 3 levels reserved for the valets. It is a good distance from honolulu (about 45 mins) so you need a car if you plan on going over there. The internet is $12/ 24 hours. Make sure you check your bill when you are going to check out and they didn't put any accidental charges on. When you arrive, they will ask for a debit/credit card to put a $200 hold on. Parking will come out of that each day. If you charge things to your room, it will also come out of that at the end of your stay. I would not recommend you give them a debit card- give them a credit card in case there is a mistake with charging on you bill and they add another hold. There is some construction going on next door, but it never bothered us. I loved being able to drive down to the busy side of the island, but also go back to the resort and be secluded and quiet.

To give you an idea how good this place is, we got married in our room. We did that for two reasons: first, the background from a balcony made for great photos and the father of the bride couldn't walk long distances. Besides \"technically\" speaking, if you get married on the grounds of the resort (other than your room) you have to pay a $500 fee. Now the room. Great, especially the enormous bathroom (which made getting ready for a wedding great). Great balcony. Our room was on the end which on the positve side allowed for a little more breeze. On the down side and this was the biggest complaint was that there is construction next door. However, it never woke me up and I'm a light sleeper. It will be a least a year or two before that construction is done but don't let that alone detract from your decision on this place. Regarding the resort, let me give you the good and bad. First, the bad. It's expensive. Meals were expensive, but good. Parking of $29/day is outrageous and due its location there is no choice but to have a car. If anything turns me off about this place it is that fee. Further, they charge for everything such as internet, local phones, cabanas. Location was good and bad. Since I'm talking about the bad, to put it simply, unless it's the beach, you must drive to do or get anything. Now, the good about this place. Tops on the list is the location (but see above). It is NOT Honolulu. Our parents stayed there so we went there often to see how they were doing. They liked being able to walk to restaurants, but there was a lot of hustle and bustle. Traffic is a nightmare. If you are looking for a quiet romantic place that you imagine to Hawaii to be then the JW Marriott far outweighs everything else. Green grass and palm trees, waterfalls (albeit in man made fountains), sandy beaches, and beautiful sunsets. The service here was top notch. The pool was nice also. Spa service was nice to have if it's what you;re looking for. Also, gym and tennis courts. Bottom line, come here if you want to get it away from it all, go to Honolulu if you want action.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cDon't Do It\u201d", "Author": "BFCNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR40017906", "Content": "This Hotel is exceptionally overrated, over-hyped, and they nickel and dime you for everything. Calling this a five-star resort/hotel (or seven stars in the Marriott rankings), is an insult to two star hotels. The much touted lagoon beach is badly designed. so that there is a huge dead-spot in the water right in front of the hotel, where all of the flotsam and gunk collects in smelly murky green water. The hotel is not near anything, and is at least 30 minutes to anything else. So as a result you are at their mercy for drinks and food. A simple gin and tonic set me back $10. The same kitchen feeds the \"high class\" restaurant and the informal restaurant, but the food is 25% more in the \"high class\" end, and the informal is hardly a bargain either. Lastly, Disney is building a hotel right next door, and the noise is horrendous. It appears construction will continue for the next 6-9 months. If your idea of a vacation is staying outside in Times Square, you'll feel right at home. The staff is courteous, but they have been programed to turn everything into a revenue raising event. When you arrive, you can count on being given the shabbiest room at the lowest level possible consistent with your reservation. Then they will graciously offer to upgade you from the room with the view of the airconditioning compressor to a more spacious room with a better view, but only if you agree to a 20-50% increase in the room rate - even though the hotel is probably only 50% occupied. If you want to see anything on the island while you are there, you will have to drive at least 30 minutes - probably longer depending on what you want to see. And since the only way to get there is by car, count on $30+/day for parking. And don't even think of bagging the car, since there isn't that much to do on site even if you are willing to venture into the smelly green water at the beach. All in all, if I had it to do over again I'd stay at the Kahala Resort or if you're set on Marriott then the one in Waikiki.

We got food from the coffee shop in the lobby for breakfast, muffins and stuff. Bought cereal and milk for the kids at the local store one exit ahead of the hotel and used refrigerator in room.

It is very time consuming to travel to most tourist areas from this hotel, but if you are looking for a quiet family oriented vacation where you dont have to lift a finger this is it. Also this is the nicest hotel on the island, there are a couple at Waikiki but they are noisy and not family oriented.

And it's the same cost whether you valet or not. Everything is extra - no leis, no robe in the room, no in-room coffee, breakfast is $$$ - so when you add this to the high room prices it rankles a bit.

The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom huge; the patio was large with nice furniture. One night there were fireworks at eye level which were amazing. We don't normally play tennis, but the rooftop courts have an ocean view so we played one afternoon and had a really great time. The tennis/spa staff was nice and the workout room well-equipped. Valets were also extremely helpful. Restaurant options on this side of the island were limited, but Roy's, which is always exceptional, is right across the street at the Ko' Olina golf course. The hotel bar has a romantic ambiance and friendly bartenders. The grounds are beautiful and the lagoon a nice addition. Great walking path along all three lagoons that ends at the Marriott Beach Club, which is fun to check out. A few things to ensure your stay is great - there is construction for a Disney hotel on the east side of the building, so make sure you stay on the ocean side or it can get loud. Also, make sure you don't plan your trip when box jellyfish are out or you won't be able to enjoy the water.

We stayed in an ocean room with magnificent views over the pool and ocean (well worth the extra money) and had plenty of space or the whole family - the bathrooms in particular were enormous. The kids loved it and so did I! It was very relaxing & indulgent. There is a shark and stingray pool & tropical fish in the lagoon that the kids can feed. Fish feeding is free and available every morning at 7am. The shark and stingray feeding is at an extra cost and only 2 or 3 times. It was well worth it and was one of the highlights of the trip. The lagoon is warm and very calm - perfect for toddlers. There is also a luau every evening at Paradise Cove next door, but we ended up going to a very good Fia Fia at the Ko Olina Marriott (free in exchange to listening to a timeshare presentation). The food in the restaurants were a bit pricey but no more than Waikiki. We made a short trip out to a nearby Safeway to stock up on drinks/fruit etc. If you are not driving it's a short taxi ride and Safeways will call you a taxi at their end. We also ate at Naupaka and the Poolside Grill and thought both were very good with big American sized servings. We found that ordering two meals was enough for the 4 of us. Naupaka also had a really good 3-course early bird special for dinner. The Expresso Cafe also had inexpensive light breakfasts such as bagels and pastries. Coffee is free for hotel guests at the cafe until 11am. There were kids menu's at all the restaurants and under 4 eat free with the breakfast buffet. There is no kids pool but my two were very happy with the lagoon and hanging around the edges of the adult pool, while we watched from lounge chairs, drinking cocktails and reading books - bliss! Spent the day at the Marriott Beach Club 2 lagoons down that is more family friendly but liked the Ihilani more...a bit more classy and less crowded. The pool at the Ihilani also had more shaded areas so the kids didn't get sunburnt. On Saturday afternoon there was Hawaiian music and hula show by the pool and activities on most days such as lei making and yoga. Staff were very friendly and helpful, with lots of Aloha.

This was the perfect location for \"getting away\" while being within driving distance of all the sites on this beautiful island. I have visited the islands over 20 times and really enjoyed staying for the first time at this hotel. We are from Southern California and spend lots of time at the beach, so we are accustomed to both freeway traffic, the hustle and bustle of tourist cities like Honolulu and beach towns like the ones on all of the islands. We were able to enjoy all areas of the island during the day, and the amenities of the hotel in the late afternoon. We did not eat at the hotel as we were out and about every day. You can get coffee/pastries in the lobby cafe or full on breakfast in the restaurant. We ate most of our dinners in Waikiki at ocean front restaurants, and did not mind the 30 minute drive back to the hotel. Believe me, Honolulu/Waikiki traffic is nothing compared to LA - and the speed limit is 55, not 80+. Don't let the drive deter you from booking your stay here. Also, Chuck's Steakhouse at the nearby Marriott Beach Resort (timeshares) was fantastic, with a great location overlooking the lagoons and lawns, and was probably the best deal we had on dinners as the meals were not a la carte. It was great to come back to the hotel at the end of the day, in the beautiful resort area of Ko Olina, and enjoy the peaceful setting on the water. Our room was very large, clean and had a terrific ocean view. The bathroom was huge compared to most hotels we've stayed in (including resorts) and was convenient to have a separate shower, tub, toilet room and two dressing vanities on opposite sides of the room. We were front and center above the pool, but found it quiet during the morning and in the evening. Our housekeeping staff was fantastic and was quite attentive. The valet staff was superb and was well worth the price - for heaven's sake - you're on vacation - valet your car!! The valet price is comparable to hotels we frequent in the Palm Springs/Indian Wells resort area in Southern California, so again, no surprises here. The pool was just fine, as we were there every afternoon and also at the lagoon which is just steps away. Both were great and the pool bar/restaurant had somewhat pricey food/drinks, but again, we were on vacation and I enjoyed the splurge of a Mai Tai served in a frozen pineapple shell! There are plenty of lounge chairs facing the pool and towards the ocean. There's also lounge chairs on the beach at the lagoon, as well as a full beach activity center. We used the business center for reserving Germaine's Luau (next exit down the highway) online and for checking in for our return flight, and did not get sucked into using a computer in our room while on vacation. (We also saved about $20 pp on the luau by doing this with Hawaiidiscount.com.) Also, the tv was just fine - just used it for viewing dvd movies we brought with us at night . Yes, Disney is full speed ahead with construction of their resort adjacent to the hotel. There is a very large construction site obscured by tidy green fences. The construction DID NOT start early in the morning (like most construction does), but started later and ended around 5-ish. Yes, there are cranes viewable above the fences. Not a big deal and really, not so bad. There is also construction across the street from the hotel, a new restaurant and possibly shops.

The JW is approximately 25-30 minutes from HNL, and given the development, traffic on the H1 can get congested during rush hour or weekend evenings. The property has aged somewhat from when I first frequented, but it remains a welcome oasis from Waikiki. The rooms are tasteful and while not Four Seasons' caliber, they are certainly better then rooms at a Marriott, Hyatt, or Hilton. As an elite member, we had an ocean front room with unobstructed views. Naturally, we left the doors open at night to listen to the waves crashing. The staff is quite attentive throughout the resort especially at the spa. We had massages which, while pricey, were quite refreshing. The signature restaurant onsite is not very good, and I would recommend dining at Roy's at the golf course or heading downtown. The other restaurants serve delectable food. The resort features a beach alcove which is quite nice as you effectively have the beach to yourself. The pool is refreshing although there is only 1 pool at the resort. The golf course is well kept and manned by friendly staff. It's fairly open and not overly challenging, but its worth a round.

There are a couple things you need to know before staying here. One - this is NOT a five star hotel (although everyone of our local friends told us that this was the best hotel on the island - which would then lead me to go to another island but we were going to Oahu for a wedding) I would say a 3.5 to a 4 star. Like other reviews have said there is an issue with the cleanliness of the rooms. The bathrooms, carpet, couch (which was severely stained) and TV have seen better days. I don't remember the last time I stayed at a hotel without a flat screen (which I thought was a requirement of a 5 star). Also, the hallways were filthy - needed some vacuuming ASAP! BUT the best was the lanai (we had a view of the ocean not facing the beach lagoon but the stingray lagoon - this is the way to go as it is MUCH quieter from the pool activities but you get to see the most AMAZING sunsets every night from your lanai) was very nice. Also, no wireless only a plug in for $12.95/night. A bit outdated. Two - there is a new Disney hotel being built right next door and right on the lagoon so this is bound to get crowded and busy once construction is finished but it was getting noisier by the day on the beach with the construction. During our visit they just had finished putting up the HUGE cranes. So beware of a room facing that way. We didn't hear any noise from the construction in our room but it was loud when we were on the beach. We had a oceanview room ($299/night with $100/night resort credit) which was a good deal. Look on mariott.com. However, the resort credit is not valid on the room rate plus taxes but the good news is the place is kinda isolated - as the other reviews have said - so you find yourself eating a lot of meals here. We ate the breakfast buffet everyday - loved the juicer - had room service the chicken fingers were good - we really enjoyed the food here despite the price but we needed to use our resort credit so it worked out. They do nickle and dime you and the price of the valet is the same as self park - so valet. The good news is you can call and tell them that you are leaving in 15min or so and they will pull your car around so you don't have to wait when you get down there. Also, due to the isolation you do have to do A LOT of driving if you are going into Waikiki (30 min) or to the north shore (45min). So rent a car - they have a lot of specials so you can get a good deal! Overall, this hotel was above average - I wouldn't go back unless I had to go back to Oahu.

I almost changed hotels but I\u2019m so glad I took the reviews with a \u201cgrain of salt\u201d and stayed at the J.W. We are Marriott Vacation Club owners and buying a Marriott timeshare was one of the best vacation decisions we have ever had. Marriott is a first class operation and has not disappointed us to date. I will break this review into sections for ease of reference. Staff and Service Top notch all the way. Prior to our arrival I received a message from the virtual concierge. Since it was birthday trip I had a number of requests. I was using points for this trip and had paid $100 for ocean view upgrade. I decided to upgrade further to a Napauka Junior Suite. Although they originally informed me it would be another $100 upon arrival I was charged nothing extra beyond the original $100. So, we had a massive 1000 square foot room for $100 per night. More on the room later. When we arrived the room they gave us was near the ball room so it was noisy. I called the desk and they immediately offered me another room overlooking the pool and lagoon, gorgeous. So, if you don\u2019t like your room or location just ask to switch, if they are not full they are more than willing to accommodate. Also prior to arrival I requested champagne, cheese and cookies upon arrival. They sent a beautiful tray up about \u00bd hour after we arrived and the champagne was complimentary. For my birthday dinner at Azul, they greeted me with a happy birthday and went out of their way to make the evening special. Our room was made up in a timely manner every day and kept tidy. Every one of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful. Public Areas Spectacular is all a can say. The grounds are meticulously maintained and absolutely beautiful. The lobby is very impressive with its massive atrium and expansive marble floors. Some have complained there are no longer flowers on the center table. It did not bother me. I think the art display is lovely and the lobby is very grand. There is a sitting area and coffee shop in the rear. Don\u2019t miss the free very delicious coffee in the morning. The sitting area opens to the fish ponds below. The pool is not big. I found the all the hotels we visited in Honolulu did not have big pools either (Halekulani and Outrigger). The huge water park type pools don\u2019t seem to be the thing here. The pool setting is lovely and the size was fine for us. It was not crowded. The lagoons are fabulous. There are beach toys for rent and also covered double lounge chairs that come with water and snacks for $20. We rented one and it was very nice. The lagoon is calm and great for swimming. It lovely to walk along the lagoons in the morning and evening. There is construction going on next door but there is a barrier. It is a bit unsightly if viewing from above but it did not seem noisy to us. We heard very little. We were out a lot during the week days we were there so it may be a bit worse. I\u2019m very sorry that this area is going to congested by Disney theme park type hotels. It\u2019s a shame, but that\u2019s progress. Location This hotel is on the leeward side so the weather is wonderful. Very predictably sunny and dry. Even when it was a bit cloudy in Honolulu it was clear in KoOlina. It is about 20 min from the airport, 35 min from Pearl Harbor and 45 min from Honolulu. Traffic was a little heavy at times but not unbearable. We are very glad we stayed here. It was peaceful and a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. We went to Honolulu often for dinner and did not have any issues with the commute. Room The rooms are very large at this hotel. Our suite was massive. It had a long marble entrance with a dry bar that contained a mini fridge. There was a massive dressing room with huge closets and a scale (nice for weighing luggage). The only thing is the closets were big but lacked enough hangers, so actually not as useful as they could be. Marriott should provide more hangers in these huge closets. Bathroom was also extremely large. Marble with two sinks a soaking tub, separate large shower with ledge seat and a separate area for toilet. Then there is the bedroom and sitting area which is also huge. We had 2 double beds, desk, couch, 2 dressers, long table and another table and table by the beds. There were two TVs. Yes, as some have complained they are not flat panel and a little older, but fine. Who would want to watch TV here anyway? They there is balcony. This was the best part. It is very large and the louvered doors open completely to the fabulous view. There is a lounge chair and full table and chair. No, the hotel is not new, but the room was still kept very well. I read some complaints about worn bath fixtures. Ours were not new, but certainly very acceptable. Our room was also very clean. One slightly annoying feature was that the clock in this suite was across the room and could not been seen at night. Also, having the light control on the nightstand had advantages and disadvantages. All in all we were very happy with the room. Restaurants Napauka is a very nice casual open air restaurant. The breakfast buffet was very nice with wonderful eggs Benedict and many options. Dinner was also very nice. Azul was wonderful. The food was excellent, the setting lovely and the staff top notch. I loved the coffee served with a tray of chocolate chips, shavings and whipped cream. What a nice ending to dinner. Price I was actually surprised that things were not as expensive as I expected. From reading I expected outrageous prices for food and services. We found the prices to be the same as any very nice resort we have stayed in. As mentioned they gave me a multi upgrade for $100. Yes, you pay for valet parking, and it is bit high, but it is expected that some things we be overpriced in resorts. Is it always justified no, but it\u2019s the way. Something to note is they gave us a multiple upgrade for only $100. They also gave me complimentary champagne and the free coffee in the morning was a nice touch. Spa I had a facial and my husband and son had massages. My facial was very nice and the first time I was not pressured to buy products. My husband said his message was the best he has had. The prices were equivalent to other hotel spas we have gone to. Overall We loved this hotel. It exceeded our every expectation. I would not hesitate for a moment to stay here again. For activities we found the location a good base. We visited Pearl Harbor, sunned on Waikiki beach, took the Outrigger catamaran sail, hiked Diamond Head, surfed the North Shore, dined at Duke\u2019s, snacked on Leonard\u2019s malasadas and had an overall wonderful time.

This last trip we got a taste for a couple of days when we got a nice break for a stay at the JW Marriott Ihilani Resort & Spa at Ko Olina. This resort property is very nice and not for the faint of pocket. Reality set when 4 of us sat down for 3 chesse burgers, chicken wings, 3 beers and a Maitai for $125 (tip included)- Ouch!!.

As with most high priced hotels you pay for everything- $13/day for internet, $30/day for parking, etc etc Our room was on the 9th floor and was very nice with the latest in nice bed/linens.

The room was a good size with a very nice large bathroom- Jacuzzi tub with a separate shower, his and hers wash bowls and a \"water closet\". Service was very good although the valet did manage to give our travel partners rental car to the wrong people however they made every effort to make up for it by making sure we had transportation till the unsuspecting couple returned with our car.

This property, taken over by Marriott in 1999 from the Nikko Hotel chain was built in 1993. I would highly recommend reserving at least an ocean view room or higher if you can swing it. We stayed there on points, but paid to upgrade to an Ihilani Suite on the 16th floor with commanding views. The hotels policy is to give a complimentary one class upgrade for Marriott Rewards Platinum Members (sorry Gold Level members\u2014they are kinda snobby on the upgrade, but you can pay for it). It was $60 per night to go from the standard room to a deluxe ocean room (deluxe is just higher than the regular ocean) with the free Platinum upgrade. If you are Gold or lower it will set you back $90 per night. From there, the upgrades get interesting. To go to the first suite it will cost you $120 per night (rack rate for this room is $800 per night) if you are not Platinum then it is $150 (providing you are using points). To step up to the suite we had, cost $210 per night (rack rate is $1500 per night) again, non platinum members it would be $240 per night if available. The suite we had was really nice. It contained 1400 square feet and two separate and distinct balconies\u2014one off of the master suite and the other off of the living room. If you have kids (we have two) and have the money\u2014I\u2019d definitely recommend it. The suite also has a separate dining area and two bathrooms. Pros: 1. Amazing rooms\u2014with REALLY huge and awesome bathrooms. I understand that we were in their second highest category, but the concierge told me that all of their bathrooms were marble, etc. Our main bathroom had a huge walk in shower and also a huge soaker tub and separate WC. The second bathroom also was done in all marble. 2. Great views\u2014we were on the \u201csunset side,\u201d for the balcony off of our living room\u2014the sunsets were similar to Key West, although honestly not quite as amazing. 3. Really good service. The service happens twice per day, which is really nice for (and almost necessary) for a beachfront property given the sand, etc. 4. Location: this is also a negative\u2014see discussion below. The Ihilani is on the sunny west coast of Oahu\u2014about a 45-minute (or so) drive from Waikiki. It is a new upscale residential area, Marriott is also building a new Ritz Carlton property on this location, they have recently finished a time share as well It is very quiet, calm and peaceful. If you want active nightlife\u2014stay somewhere else. 5. The Marina. We went swimming with dolphins in the wild for our sons 10th birthday\u2014how cool is that? 6. Beaches: they have three man-made lagoons, which are great. The water is very calm and very warm. There is little or no wake. The beaches are beautiful but are man made\u2014they were trucked in. They are also groomed everyday. 7. Restaurants. There are several really good restaurants. They have a great seafood buffet every Saturday night in their open and airy restaurant, on Wednesday night\u2019s they feature Prime Rib. There is also a Japanese restaurant and bar and a more formal dressy restaurant. Bottom line here is that the food is *very* expensive, dinners averaged $200 per for our family of four. The breakfast buffet set up back $80, you get the picture. 8. Golf Course: While it is clearly not Pinehurst #2 (my personal favorite course to play) or Pebble (my second favorite), heck or even Shadow Creek for that matter, it is a very nice and quite scenic resort course. Here too, it is expensive, around $200 per round with everything and is not in the league of the aforementioned tracks. 9. Spa. Perhaps the best for last. Don\u2019t go to the Ihilani unless you plan on using the Spa. It was recently voted the #1 Spa in the world by Conde Naste readers\u2014I wholeheartedly concur. Cons: 1. Expensive. Be prepared to spend a ton of money going into it\u2014that\u2019s what I did and we had a great time. For example, a spa treatment my wife and I get at home in North Texas was triple the cost at the Ihilani\u2014that\u2019s why we skipped the typical treatments and opted for things like the \u201cstone treatment\u201d that you can\u2019t get anywhere else. 2. The time share sales pitch. I didn\u2019t go to this property to be asked to: \u201cbecome an owner.\u201d It was not as bad as the Marriott Ocean Club (see my review of that horrible property), but enough said. 3. You aren\u2019t near any type of \u201caction.\u201d Which was fine for us\u2014but if you in the single crowd and want to go to bars, etc. this is NOT the property for you\u2014go to Waikiki. 4. The entire property is heavily geared to tipping. While I don\u2019t mind tipping this place is insane. Literally everyone seemingly has their hand out all day, I guess this dovetails into the clientele, I\u2019d guess the average household income of those privileged enough to spend time here is 250K+, but I didn\u2019t like being expected to hand out money all day, every day. 5. NO HIGH SPEED INTERNET access in the rooms. There is a business center in the basement that has four stations\u2014but it costs $.15/minute for the privilege of checking email. To me, if they charge you nearly 2K per night (between all the sundry taxes, etc.) they should \u201cthrow in\u201d internet access in each room. Summary: The JW Marriott Ihilani at Ko Olina is a top-notch beach resort. They have one of the best spas on the planet. The views are amazing, the beaches are wonderful, the water is warm, etc. The only item that I would ask you to consider is that be prepared to totally \u201crelax.\u201d I mean that in a good way, as a week was a bit too long for me. I am an attorney with a very busy practice. After a couple of days of sitting on the beach (and swimming with the dolphins) I was ready to go and do \u201csomething,\u201d We explored literally all of Oahu but if we go back to the Ihilani again (and I certainly would) It would be for three to four days\u2014other than that it is a winner!", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay", "Title": "\u201cNice Beach\u201d", "Author": "bacamper", "ReviewID": "UR28566489", "Content": "Stayed at the JW Marriott for 7 nights while on vacation with the entire family.

They were the cheapest, scratchiest, loudest sheets ever. Worse then a motel6. Not what I expect from a JW. The hotel never seemed crowded. The pool is very small as is the deck around it. The highlight of this resort is the lagoon. It was very beautiful, not crowded. Great for the kids and adults to swim in. Can snorkle in there also. They have a fish feeding daily at 7:30am by the lagoons edge. The morning buffet is terrible. I have no issue with the price, actually expected it to cost more then the $24 that it was. But my party was skipped over while waiting for a table. We came across countless dirty plates and glasses as did the people at a neighboring table. There was nothing special or particularly good about the food. I recommend just grabbing something from the pastry shop in the morning or going to the nearby town of Kapolei where there are tons of places to eat any meal. The hotel charges $29 per day whether you self park or valet, so you might as well valet. But if you do self-park it is very close by and easy to get in and out of. The valets were always very nice and very fast. The fitness center is very nice and opens early. Also there is a paved path along the lagoons that is great for jogging. They had some live music by the pool on only 2 of the 7 nights we were there. And that ended at 7pm. The pool bar closes around that time also. We walked down the beach to the Marriott Beach Club every night. They always had live entertainment until 9pm and their bar stays open till 9:45 . The resort is about 45 minutes from honolulu, and everything else. You\u2019ll be doing tons of driving to do your sight seeing.

They have 2 separate little \"ponds\" (don't know what else to call them, and I'm fron Kansas and that's what we call them there :) ) one with little sharks, and one with stingrays. You could spend a lot of time just looking at those. The pool is nice, though for the number of people the hotel holds is a little small. The public hotel areas are realy nice with a lot of lush vegatation. The beach is great. They have little cove's to swim in which are protected from waves so they are very good for swimming in the ocean. Food: Probably about the only bad experience. There were maybe 10 tables full for breakfast and 15 or so empty and we had to wait for a table??? The greeters at the resturaunts seemed very innefficient and were the only staff we dealt with the entire time that I would not consider top notch.

We had the nachos and the quesadilla, as well as many mai tais and lava flows. :) We ate at two restaurants- Chuck Steakhouse by Lagoon #3, which was so-so. The other one was the main restaurant by the pool for dinner. Service was slow and we each had a $15 bacon cheeseburger that was passable. I'd suggest hopping in your car to go to Kapolei to eat. We also ordered room service one night- the creme brulee, which was pretty good. Overall, though, Ko Olina is Hawaiian paradise.

Because of some of the reviews, I was apprehensive about the property. However that completely changed after checking in. Check in was really easy, they had all the right information. The room was beautiful with a great ocean view. Floor to ceiling windows right across the lanai. The lanai was huge, accommodating a table with 2 chairs and two loungers, with room to spare. Every night we listened to the crash of the ocean as we went to sleep. In the morning, we awoke to birds singing. In the distance we could watch whales play. The room clean, with first class amenities. Absoultely no complaints about the room. The room attendant did an excellent job. Note: The side of the hotel we stayed on - with only ocean views, faces private property where some nights, there are parties and lauaus. They can be quite loud, starting after dusk and finishing around 10. However, only 1 event over the 11 days was really too loud. Mountain view rooms might hear the construction from the disney resort next door. Yes, the meals are expensive. That is typical with resorts. If you have a car and you really should have one for longer stays, Kapolei,10 minutes down the road has many good reasonably priced restaurants, a Costco, Zippy's, Safeway, etc. We ate once at the hotel, at the Japanese buffet. The food was good, but not enough variety to justify the cost. We wouldn't eat there again. The lagoon and beach was beautiful. Good snorkeling. The pool is a little small and crowded and the hot tub is way to small for this size hotel. some of the pool loungers are in need of repair. Anyways we preferred the beautiful beach. Yes, parking is expensive. However, many many resorts now charge a resort fee of comparable price, whether you use the resort facilities or not. Fees are a part of hotel operations now, just like baggage fees are the norm for airlines. Valet service was excellent. Ask them a question and they either have pre-printed directions or good advice. All the staff were good to deal with. I honestly cannot understand the negative reviews of this property. I am a very picky traveller and have stayed in many many places. No this is NOT a 3 star hotel. NO this is NOT a bad place to say. I say it definetely a 4.5 star hotel.

It was secluded, but not a far drive to Honolulu and convenient to the rest of the island. The surrounding area was beautiful and tropical. Our room had a fabulous view overlooking the pool, lagoon and the pacific ocean. The balcony was very spacious and had a table and two chairs, a lounge chiar and a beautiful flower box. The room was wonderful and very large. The staff, from the front desk to the pool and lagoon attendant, was very friendly and helpful. We had complimentary Kona coffee and bought pastries each morning for breakfast. We dined one night at the Azul restaurant and it was wonderful. We had the menu specials which were 4 course meals for $45 each. Since we used reward points the property was very reasonable, but if we had paid for it, it would have been worth the expense. My only regret was that my wife wanted to explore the island every day and we didn't spend as much time at the resort as I would have liked. But it was her birthday so she got to choose. We also spent 3 additional nights at the Aqua Coconut in Waikiki and had a very good experience. The hotel was very clean and fun and the staff was excellent. The Aqua Coconut is 3 or 4 blocks from Waikiki but was surrounded by lots of nice restaraunts and shops. We didn't care much for Waikiki so it didn't matter to us that we were not right on the beach.

From talking with other attendees of the conference our room was bigger than most. However the room was filthy. The bathroom had hair and toilet paper on the floor. One of the drinking glasses was visibly dirty and we would set it out each day to be cleaned. It became a game as we would put food, juice, etc in the glass and each day the glass would be rinsed out with the same crud stuck on the bottom. It wasn't until we actually took the glass to housekeeping that we got a clean glass. The wicker furniture was also filthy as we found out when we laid some of clothes on it to dry out and instead covered our clothes with a gray/black grime. The prices of the restaurants, drinks, and amenities were not any where close to the quality expected. One of the dinners was at Azul and was mediocre in quality and the service was worse. The food was not that good and was extremely overpriced. Now for the positives. Our stay was made bearable by the staff working at the hotel. We had some less than stellar staff but the positives more than outweighed the low sides. The valet workers and the beach lifeguards were awesome. They were very helpful and made us feel like we were really welcome at the hotel. One of the gentlemen working at the front desk was also very good.

We have stayed at quite a few Marriott properties with my business travels. Up until this trip we were not concerned with quality.

Unfortunately, we had lousy weather, but that is not the subject of this review. Just as a heads' up to other Christmas travelers, the part of Oahu where Ihilani is situated is very windy, and all of Oahu gets rain at Christmas time. The Ihilani is quite remote - unless you want to be a captive of the resort, a car is a must. The hotel charges a very steep $30 per night to park a car, whether you valet or self-park. However, having a car saved the vacation (particularly as it was not beach weather). There are many possibilities for day trips to the North Shore, Pearl Harbor and Waikiki, etc. The hotel is looking a little worn and in need of a renovation. While our room was spacious and had a nice size balcony which was sheltered from the wind, the corridor carpets were badly stained and walls were scuffed and chipped. Our room had one technical glitch after another, and we had a parade of engineers trying to fix things. Internet is available by ethernet cable and only one computer can log on at a time. You must ask them to only charge you once per day if you wish to use two computers ($13.00/day); once you have paid, you can connect via wi-fi in the lobby. There was a hole where the refrigerator should had been. We asked for one and were put on a \"wait list\", with it finally arriving a day later. The refrigerator is key, as the hotel food is quite expensive, but there is a Safeway just a few miles away. The hotel restaurants were adequate, but on the holidays, imposed a steep fixed price menu ($85 for Christmas and New Years). The higher end of the restaurants on a regular night would cost a minimum $70 per person, before drinks. The night we tried it, we were surrounded by screaming, exhausted children. The lowest priced wine was $17 a glass or $65 a bottle! There is a nice spa and gym, and a lovely lap pool which was always sheltered and uncrowded. I did not play the golf course. However, they allow for 5-somes to tee off , making for a very slow round. The restaurant at the golf course has great food and the prices are reasonable. The beach is man-made, with lagoon swimming which is good for small children. Covered beach lounges are $40 per day - yet another high charge. - and ,had the weather been good, there were not nearly enough to accomodate the hotel guests. Across the street from the hotel is a huge open space, soon to be occupied by a Disney hotel. When the construction begins, the noise and dust will be monumental.

The staff does not tend the beach--beach chairs are scattered all over in a mess every morning, unlike other beach J.W's we've stayed at. Toilets in the restaurant were missing hardware. Stairs had no-slip treads coming half off. Not really acceptable for such a pricey stay. The rooms were very private and clean; good housekeeping. We also liked the lack of crowds and lack of touristy kitsch. But the \"lagoons\" felt artificial and man-made. There are no waves at all, though the beach was nicely uncrowded while we where there.

Why these resort hotels promote relaxation, only to bombard you with their loud, uninvited music is beyond me. One other note is to be aware that they're just starting construction of a Disney hotel next-door to the Marriott. For now, it's not an issue and you wouldn't notice it unless you're using the beach.

The location is undeniably pure paradise. The lagoons are perfect for snorkelling and swimming - we saw a turtle on our first snorkel and colourfil fish not far off what we saw at Hanauma Bay! However, I have to echo a few comments made by previous reviewers. The staff absoloutely let this place down. They're cretainly not unfriendly or unhelpful but they're not exactly welcoming and warm. For a holiday destination like this you expect a little warmth and hospitatiliy. Resort prices for food and wine were ridiculous and be warned .... if you're going during a busy period fridges in room don't come as standard. We reqeusted one on our first day and were put on a \"waiting list\" although I had my doubts. The cynic in me thought it was a convenient way to limit the food and drink we kept in our room. I would strongly recommend you request one in advance of your arrival and find a convincing reason for having one if needed ;-) Rooms are spacious, views are spectacular. However, we did expect an ocean view room and actually got a partial ocean view in my opinion. If you stood to your side you'd see ocean but directly in front of you was a car park and the neighbouring Paradise Cove. Requested a move but they could not oblige due to capacity issues and offered to reduce our rate. Not ideal because it was a special holiday for us and we'd have preferred the view over the cash. Spa prices are ... in my experienced spa opinion ....exorbitant! Whilst the massage was first class and the pedicure / manicure faultless ... a little research into neighbouring spa facilities would no doubt save you a small fortune. Finally, on checking out we had quite a few \"errors\" on our bill. As an example, the reduced rate was only applied for one night, in resort credit offers we had on booking were not applied and there were two or three extra charges (albeit it nominal) that could not be accounted for. Worth taking five minutes to go through it. So in summary. Would highly recommend the resort for families with young kids.

The location is very far from anything and you may think a secluded hotel will ensure a little paradise but this one doesn't. On the sides of JW Marriott there were constructions sites for two very tall buildings and the entire setting looked mass tourism. The local staff was rather dull during our 5 nights stay, I couldn't quite get it where is the Hawaii spirit they keep advertising. Liked : -the room. Very big, elegantly decorated, modern, comfortable. All housekeeping services were spotless.Big balcony-terrace facing the Ocean. (I would recommend to pay a little extra for the Ocean view, the mountain view was dry and pretty ugly) -the breakfast. Simply a perfect 5 stars hotel variety. The location of the breakfast restaurant it's splendid, next to fish pond or inside in the garden. -the view of the pool and the ocean garden illumination during the night. Spectacular. -Beds. Fantastic comfort. I guess it's a Marriott trade mark :-) Disliked: -location of the hotel. In the middle of the nowhere and once you're out on the motorway there are some nasty looking neighbourhoods around. -the beach in front of the hotel is made of ugly looking sand. Looks rather like fragmented concrete than natural sand. -no umbrellas on the beach. We had to move to the pool for shade. -there was a violent scene between a beach boy and a hotel guest. The hotel security intervened but it was a disturbing moment for all tourists. -eating in the hotel was extremelly expensive and not nicely prepared rather on the American mass-tourism fast food trend. -too close to Pearl Harbour which made for terrible noise during their daily flying routine. All in all : probably a superb stay for a congres. Dreadfull if what you're expecting it's exotic holiday in Hawaii.

The manager handled the situation extremely well, and we were offered a choice of a suite as a replacement, but opted for another ocean view room instead. Location This hotel is located on the south west coast of Oahu, about a 45 min drive from Waikiki. There is no public transport, and not easy to get to any nearby towns, restaurants etc unless you have a car, as taxis can end up becoming expensive. For the days we required a car, we hired one from the Hertz desk located at the airport, it opens up at 7am and as long as you drop the keys off with the hotel front desk prior to 11pm, you will avoid the $29 parking fee. Just pick a new car up the next day if you need another. Facilities As the resort has several large lagoons, as well as the pool, we didn't find it that busy when looking for space. There are special lounge chairs with shade available for additional charge, if you need it. The hotel provides 2 hours free rental per day of snorkel gear or kayak. The internet access is expensive, but manage to randomly find that I was able to access free wireless by the gift shop and bar entrance at the stairs. As others have pointed out, the restaurants are pretty good, but you do have limited choice (becomes more annoying the longer you stay) and can become quite expensive. You can also walk to the Ko Olina Beach Resort (15 mins) along the nice walkway, to eat at those restaurants also. They also have a larger convenience store then at the JW. One thing we found frustrating is the lack of tours/activities from the hotel, due to it's location. For example, the Pearl Harbour tour only runs once a week! They run every day from the Waikiki hotels, so be aware if you intend to use the tours. Also the spa located at the hotel was severely overpriced, costing around $200 (after you pay the tax and the 22% tip then add on top) for a 50 min massage. A round of golf also seem a bit steep. Room The room was clean and a good size. The balcony was what we liked the most, and being able to sit outside and watch the sunset. Having the sound of the ocean there is great. As others have stated the birds are quite noisy around sunset, but apart from that we didn't notice it, I would prefer that to the traffic, people etc that you hear from the rooms at the Waikiki hotels any day. The bathroom was probably the biggest I've seen, with two basins, bath and separate shower. There are no coffee/tea facilities which was poor, but we had refrigerators in both rooms, so not sure why the previous reviewer didn't have one. Overall, this hotel is pricey, but we felt it provided value for money. The location added to the relaxing atmosphere, the fact that you couldn't pop down to the shops or restaurants meant that we just chilled. If you want to be right in the thick of the action and tourist areas, this hotel isn't for you. The staff were excellent, and every single one was friendly and helpful. My final tip is to make sure you snorkel around the lagoons, we managed to see a sea turtle that swam around us, which was amazing experience.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location - poor value for money\u201d", "Author": "millionmiletraveller", "ReviewID": "UR21226661", "Content": "My wife and I have just returned from a 2 week stay at the JW Marriott Ihilani Resort and Spa at Ko Olina.

Wonderful well kept hotel gardens and pathway for walking along the shore line 3. Very friendly & helpful staff that are willing to accommodate your needs 4. Large spacious rooms with great views of the ocean \u2013 it\u2019s worth getting an ocean view room on a high floor. 5. Great beach area with fully protected lagoon for swimming, which is open to the public. Weekdays are quite, but it gets busy at the weekends, which was not a problem for us. Negatives 1. The extras really mount up. Expect to pay: - $29/ night to park a car - $12.50 for a pool side cocktail - $35/day for renting a cabana on the beach - $24/person for buffet breakfast - $100+/copuple to eat in Azul restaurant - $60+ for a bottle of wine - $12.95/day for internet access None of the above includes taxes or gratuity 2. Lack of shade on the beach. The midday sun is very hot and most people run for the limited shade. 3. Small hotel pool and surrounding area resulting in some over crowding. 4. Limited facilities in the room. No coffee maker, refrigerator, etc Marriott Rewards If you are Marriott reward member don\u2019t expect any privileges or concessions what so ever at this hotel. I am a gold member and received zero recognition for it \u2013 not even a complimentary bottle of water at check-in. Summary If money is no object and you want a great holiday in a quiet location then I am sure you would not be disappointed if you stayed at the JW Marriott Ihilani Resort and Spa at Ko Olina.

The noise is deafening - you cannot hear the waves. For the price one is paying, I expect to get complimentary internet, choice of USA Today and NY Times, not just the local paper, and bottled water in the room. The free coffee downstairs in the morning is very nice, tbut he prices charged for pastry is ridiculous. The best place for adults to hang out and have something nice to eat and decent drinks is the Hokelau Lounge. Unfortunately, it's only open from 6pm-12am. Final word - we did end up buying the time share. The Ko Olina Beach Club is much nicer than the Ihilani. Cannot recommend this to others.

The lagoon was incredibly beautiful and we spent our time snorkeling, floating and lazing around in the sun. The breakfast buffet at the Naupaka Terrace was defiantly worth the price... fresh fruit, made to order omelets (crab & shrimp please), Belgian waffles, Portuguese sausage... need I go on? We certainly enjoyed it! BUT... don't bother with the seafood buffet, it was not worth the price and left us disappointed. Do however have dinner at Roy's, five minutes down the road.

We had originally booked the room for two adults and one child, with two queen beds We went to our room and had one king bed and no where for a child to sleep. We left the room and had a delicious meal on site and had a look around the property, figuring that staff would bring a roll away in while we were out. We returned to our room to discover that our child still had no place to sleep. We went back to the desk and spoke to another person. After another trip off the property, we returned to find a very nicer than usual roll away bed in the room. It was booked as an ocean view, which is was. We were on the fifth floor, it would have been nice to have been on a higher floor for more view of the ocean. But we did get some nice sunset photos from the room. Our room overlooked the fish lagoon and gazebo. We could see the stingray swimming in the lagoon from our balcony. There were several weddings at the gazebo during our stay. The room was very large and very clean with a giant marble bathroom which had a jacuzzi tub and a large separate marble shower. The toilet was in it's own room. One complaint was that the room refrigerator was sitting in the middle of the bathroom floor and did not seem to belong there, we had to walk around it. There is a room control console near the bed that can control any light in the room, also make phone calls, with a clock and alarm too. There were even lights under the side tables of the bed which were wonderful if someone had to get up in the night. The hotel sits near a beautiful lagoon which was great for swimming and snorkeling. The hotel pool was fairly small for the number of rooms there. The only option for your vehicle onsite is the parking garage which had a $29 per night fee. There were usually three concierge in the lobby to help you plan any number of trips or tours. We had a dive trip which left right from the hotel. And there was a class for children where they were given information on the fish in the lagoon and then actually were able to wade into the lagoon and actually feed the fish and stingray by hand. A bit pricey at $30 a child who had to be accompanied by an adult at $39 if they were under 12.

This J.W. Marriott hotel is first class. Great bed, large rooms, sliding glass doors with wooden shutters which are along the length of the room to the outdoor lanai (offering a breathtaking view), excellent bathroom size with shower and tub, nice atrium in the middle with fast elevators, large hallways to the rooms, very good soundproofing, high quality design and construction, modern architecture even though the hotel is 15 year old, nice hotel layout to access pool, lobby and restaurants, and rooms have privacy from other rooms so no one can look into your room. The hotel is immaculate and kept up as much as possible. Maid service is also excellent and supplies more towels at night. The pool is not done with plaster but is all different color tiles like the pool at the Halekulani Hotel in Waikiki. It is circular and they use salt instead of chlorine. I would say the pool is extremely well taken care of and not like a typical chlorine pool. The pool water has buoyancy to it and fun to swim. It is also was not too cold but not too warn either. It was just right. They have lots of nice staff at the pool and at the beach and can give you lots of attention if you need it. All the staff was quite helpful and considerate from the lobby to the pool and the restaurants. This hotel did not seem like a typical Marriott. It was definitely much better and not so Marriott feeling. This hotel is not a Four Seasons type either. This J.W. tends to be more on the casual side and laid back which we preferred. The hotel is located on a man-made lagoon and beach. It is not on a natural beach. The natural shoreline is rocky and the surf breaks right on the rocks. Man-made lagoon is pretty large with no waves from the ocean since the reef and rocks are right at the entrance to the lagoon and block the surf from forming inside and to the lagoon beach. So it is very safe to swim, chill out and relax. The hotel is located inside the guard gated KoOlina resort which includes a golf course, 3 additional lagoons, two large towers which were the Marriott\u2019s timeshare (Marriott Beach Club), a Condo tower, and a small golf club house that has a Roy\u2019s restaurant. The KoOlina resort has homes along the golf course and is very upscale. It is about 20 miles from Honolulu airport and crowded Waikiki. It is a perfect get away from normal day to day living and to just relax. The location does not easily lend itself to tourist activities such as exploring the island, sightseeing, or shopping. If that is what you want, then you are better off at staying in Waikiki. The food at the restaurants was quite good. The breakfast buffet was very fresh and excellent. Food service was also very good. Dinner at the Japanese restaurant was excellent but it is closed on Tuesdays and Weds. We only ate at the hotel restaurants and one night at Roy\u2019s. We did not have one bad meal. No complaints. The one negative was the excessive billing for parking, internet, business center, etc. They charge $12.95 per 24 hours of internet access and $29 per day for parking (there is no other parking available so you are a captive). The business center cost $.35 per page to print and $6.00 for 10 minutes of internet. Breakfast was $24 per person and dinner can run over $100 for two. Pool alcohol tropical drinks are $12. So, you need to factor that into your budget otherwise your bill at check out might surprise you. My only suggestion would be for Marriott to build the Internet and high parking fees into the room cost so you can better plan for your budget like they do on the mainland. Many folks have complained about the parking and internet since you are a captive when at the resort and we all know what happens when little of no choices are available. At the Marriott Beach Club, they have an internet kiosk where you can get 10 mins of Internet access for $1. That timeshare is within walking distance or the hotel has a free shuttle over to the timeshare Marriott. The J.W. should match what the timeshare is offering its guests. Also, many others have complained about the cost of parking. Since we didn't have a car and ate at the restaurants, I assume the Marriott GM was a happy camper. Although the J.W. suggested that guests should rent a car, the drive to Honolulu can be over an hour at certain traffic times and that is not something we wanted to experience during our vacation. Also, the freeway diamond lane requires 3 people to be in the car and these diamond lanes are closely watched by the Oahu police. Be careful. One last disappointment is the cost to get a shuttle from the airport to KoOlina. The rate is $85 one-way for two. Don\u2019t try to prepay for a roundtrip since some of the shuttle companies are known to take advantage of tourists. I think the hotel offers a fixed price pickup and drop-off which is done by \u201cVIP Trans\u201d. Most shuttles have set prices for transportation from the airport into Waikiki (east) but not to KoOlina which is in the opposite direction (west) from the airport. You need to plan on this expense since the hotel does not offer courtesy shuttles outside of the KoOlina resort.

Food was very good, especially the seafood buffet at the main restaurant that had an amazing selection at a very reasonable price. The breakfast buffet was also pretty good. We also tried the Japanese restaurant and liked it. They have a special early evening event when all sushi and their special cocktails are 50% off. The pool and the beach were great as well. There are plenty of beds available and we never had trouble finding a vacant spot. The lagoon is a great place to swim and is full of amazing tropical fish. The hotel rents out snorkeling equipment. Now, a couple of complaints. The hotel does not provide any coffee or tea making equipment in the room; nor do they have mini bars. This is very surprising for a property of their class. Perhaps they want people to go down and spend money at the restaurants. Another thing that was missing - bathrobes. Also very surprising.

We could not have been more pleased with our experience. Every person we dealt with was super-friendly and helpful, especially the valets. The hotel grounds are beautifully done (very cool fish, ray, and shark pools) and the lagoons are perfect for swimming. The pool/hot tub area is very nice, but we didn't get to use it much. (The 10:00 pm closing time is strictly enforced, but we spent our days out and about.) The hotel lobby is open to the outside and a lovely breeze comes through. At check in (which was very pleasant), we were given a room on the 17th floor, which had an absolutely stunning ocean/sunset view. Being so far up (and away from the pool area), we got no noise from down below. The room was very comfortable with a sitting area and a \"glamour\" bath with separate vanities, a soaking tub, and a separate glass shower. The beds are really comfortable with lots of extra pillows. I did note that the layout of the room was a bit awkward in that you didn't have a good view of the TV from either the bed or the sitting area, but who goes to Hawaii to watch TV anyway? This was not a problem to us at all. We dined in two of the three onsite restaurants. At the Japanese one, we had the dinner buffet which included shrimp, steak, and several varieties of sushi and sashimi. The price tag is steep ($45/person) but its all you can eat, its delicious sushi, and its Hawaii so we went with it anyway. We had the breakfast buffet at the poolside Naupaka Terrace twice. This was outstanding. Again the price is high for breakfast ($25/person), but we filled up there and skipped lunch those days, so it ended up being an okay deal. They have every breakfast food you can think of and then some and its all very fresh and tasty. We weren't bothered at all by the birds. Hello, its an open air restaurant! Of course there are birds!! We had dinner there one night as well and the prices are fairly reasonable ($13 for a tasty chicken sandwich and fries.) The other restaurant, Azul, seemed to be a little more upscale and the menu sounded heavenly, but we didn't get to try it. The thing we most enjoyed about the Ihilani was its location. We wanted to see Oahu without having to deal with the hustle and bustle of Honolulu and Waikiki, so this hotel was just the ticket. Depending on traffic, it seemed to be about 30 minutes to an hour from Honolulu, but its so calm and serene we felt we were a world away. Its certainly close enough that you can drive to Honolulu for dinner if you choose, but if you want to be steps away from the nightlife, this is not the place for you. (We drove into Honolulu for a fantastic dinner at Alan Wong's....highly recommend!!) Pearl Harbor was about a 35 minute drive from the hotel early in the morning. If we had to pick one negative thing about this hotel, it would be the cost. There's a daily resort fee and internet usage is not included here. There is no self-park option, only valet, so you end up spending a lot in tips on top of everything else. The restaurants are pricey, and there aren't other options nearby (at least that we found.)

While we still strongly prefer vacationing in Maui or Kauai, this property on Oahu was just what we were looking for in terms of beauty, relaxation, diverse activities, and amenities. The hotel is in a secluded area on the west side of the island, 25 minutes from the airport and 35 minutes to Waikiki. The property is settled on 4 beautiful coves that provide calm beaches, good snorkeling, and several family friendly options for water activities (free to guests). The pool is nice and shallow throughout - good for floating and kids. The rooms were quite large and the views of the ocean, coves, mountains, sunset, and stars was fantastic. Our first room had a very loud A/C unit (hotel was completely remodeled) and was infested with tiny ants. We complained to the hotel staff several times. After 3 nights of \"fixing\" the situation, my wife and children were covered in nasty ant bites. Finally, the hotel manager moved our room to a jr. suite. No problems in this room, and it was very large (approx. 1,000 sq feet). In terms of food at the hotel, the breakfast buffet was excellent but pricey ($28 for adults) with lots of choices. More local food would have been interesting. Azul, the most formal restaurant at the hotel, was fantastic in terms of food, atmosphere (great sunset), and service. This was my favorite meal of the trip, slightly ahead of Alan Wong's! My wife would disagree. The sushi restaurant was disappointing and only open a few nights. The bar was nice, but had a very limited food menu and only had entertainment (great local band!) on Friday and Saturday nights. Roy's fish restaurant was a few blocks away, and it was very good and had much different selections than the Roy's in the states. The hotel had excellent fitness programs that were free of charge. We did yoga and stretching on the beach, aqua jogged in the cove, and morning fitness walks. The instructors were very friendly and the class sizes were very small. My wife had a massage at the spa, which she enjoyed. There is a huge fitness center attached to the hotel, but we did not use it, as we wanted to be outside. The hotel has several very large pools for fish that are beautiful and kept the kids entertained for hours. One pool contained hammer head sharks and a reef tip shark. Another contained rays that ranged from small to enormous. The other contained tropical fish. For $30 each, my children were able to feed all of the fish, including the sharks. This was a highlight for the kids, as the instructor was very knowledgeable and the fish were hungry. The only reason that I did not rate it as \"Excellent\" was that the service from the hotel staff was only fair. It seemed that few people wanted to go the extra mile when we asked for help or information. It was surprising, as I expected to get much more of the \"Aloha\" spirit that they always sell. Much of the staff seemed bothered by having to assist. I should note that the pool, beach, and fitness was excellent. Last comments: We loved the \"Ko-Olina Cat\" sunset sail cruise. The boat, staff, and entire experience was perfect! 40 dolphins were swimming right off the tip of the boat. They offer a snorkeling event as well, and people were raving about it. Wish we had done that! We did a swim with the dolphins snorkeling event with a different company that was OK. Boat was power only/no sail, too crowded and obnoxious tourists (grabbing the sea turtles and kicking in the water which frightened the dolphins away) The Dole Plantation is a very over-rated tourist trap. Wish we had skipped that!! The Luau at the beach next to the JW Marriott was just OK. The kids liked it, but it was too commercial for adults.

We were refused when we asked to see a manager, and spent an hour arguing with the front desk before getting into the room we were paying for.

We also had red fire ants in our room--we both were bitten on several occasions, even after they told us they had sprayed twice and taken care of the problem. The service was awful, the staff rude. The \"premier\" restaurant was horribly overpriced, with poor food (overcooked shrimp and vegetables, other items cold by the time they were served) and a pitiful wine list (only 4 reds to choose from).

I found this idyllic spot - the Ihilani Resort. It was away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and downtown Honolulu. It is located on the west side of Oahu, 20 minutes away from Honolulu airport and 45 minutes away from the world famous surfing locale, Banzai Pipeline. The resort grounds has 4 different swimming lagoon areas, a hammerhead shark and sting ray pool, beach just outside the hotel doors, and a beautiful golf course. The tide pools filled with sea creatures are on private property adjacent to the hotel, but many guests have no problem exploring the area. In fact, a kids camp, which is basically a babysitting service, take kids to the tidepools to learn about the fish and other sea critters found on the reef and tidepools. Kayaks, snorkeling gear, and surfboards can be rented on the beachshore. The beach itself is not overly crowded as you would find in Waikiki. The lagoon is perfect for early morning swims and safe for children because the outside breakers prevent the strong currents from coming in. The swimming pool at the hotel is on the smaller side compared to some of the pools at other resorts on the outer islands, but it's very clean and doesn't seem crowded. Very nice! There are 3 options for the rooms - Garden view, Ocean view, Ocean front. We stayed at an Ocean view roon and it was breathtaking. From our balcomny, we had a great view of the beach, tidepools, the garden with the sharks and sting rays, and the Waianae mountain range. We had 2 double beds, a sitting area, a bathroon with a large tub and a shower, and his and hers sinks. The only problem we had was with a loose shower knob that at times did not allow us to have hot water. Also, I wish a small refrigerator was included in the room. (We needed to fill up our ice bucket with ice quite often for our baby's milk.) The room was clean without the smell of smoke, and that's throughout the hotel. The staff, housekeeping, concierge, bell service, dining room hosts and servers were very friendly and helpful. The parking was horrendous, charging us $29.00 per night. The overall ambience despite the hotel being 90% occupied at the time we stayed in the peak of summer, was a relaxing, care-free, no-worries feeling. We weren't rushed, no lines to fight through, and we faced no traffic when driving to the Northshore, the countryside of Oahu.

We had an incredible time! I am surprised to read a few reviews stating that the staff was not friendly. We had an absolutely excellent experience with every staff member there - from the valet attendants, front desk staff, to servers at the restaurants. We were so happy with the servers at the Pool Grill, we left a fat tip on our last day. Everyone was super helpful! I am on a medication that needs to be refrigerated, so they put a mini-fridge in our room and on our last day, they kept my medication in their personal fridge behind the front desk - very accomodating! In my thinking, if you treat the staff with respect, they will return the favor. My husband is a 'Gold' status with Marriott, so we have stayed at plenty of Marriott's and this one was just as nice as any other. We had an ocean view room on the 10th floor with amazing views of the lagoon/pool area. The bed was perfect, just like the other Marriott's we have stayed at. This one might not be as fancy as some of the other JW's, but you're in Hawaii! This is the place to relax and just chill. Some ideas for where to eat if you want to get out of the Ko Olina area - I would definitely recommend getting a car to get out and explore the island - it is beautiful. We ate at the hotel only one night. You have got to try Alan Wong's in Honolulu - our best meal of the trip. It is written up as one of Oahu's best restaurants, and with good reason. Also, up in Haleiwa on the North Shore, Haleiwa Joe's is really good for fresh fish and prime rib. Thanks to the bartenders at Ihilani for telling us about that place! Things to do - I highly recommend the Wild Side Specialty Tours in Waianae for snorkeling with wild spinner dolphins - an incredible experience. A marine biologist leads the trip, and they limit the amount of people to 15, so you are always guaranteed a small group. Also, definitely go on a drive to the North Shore - it is beautiful and fun to check out all the surfing beaches (even though they are super calm in the summer). The town of Haleiwa is great - cute, laid back, and fun little shops. We stood in line forever at Matsumoto's for the shave ice - but you've got to -it is awesome! We also did kayaking in Kailua - on the Windward side of the island. Very neat - could see sea turtles right underneath you while skimming across the water. This was my 4th trip to Hawaii and definitely my favorite. I had stayed on Waikiki Beach years ago and this was SO much better. We barely went down there - too many people and way too touristy. We have nothing but positive things to say about the Marriott. It is on the expensive side, but I would think most people realize that if they know anything about Marriott, specifically the JW's. It's a vacation, isn't that when you are supposed to splurge a little??? My last recommendation - get out and explore! The Marriott is wonderful, but the island itself is fantastic - beautiful countryside, hiking spots, etc. There is so much more to Oahu than Waikiki Beach, and that is just another reason why staying at the JW Marriott is a perfect choice.", "Date": "July 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Olympia, Wash.", "Title": "\u201cGreat place!\u201d", "Author": "deborahj62", "ReviewID": "UR17526108", "Content": "I received an offer in the mail from Marriott to visit Ko Olina Beach Club resort, the adjoining property to this hotel.

This was a \"girls' retreat\" so they placed us in the hotel instead of the resort property, in a very nice, large room with 2 beds. The cost of the entire 5-night package equaled about what the cost of 2 nights of the Ihilani room cost would've been. The whole property was lovely and there was absolutely no sales pressure. We don't golf, but the golf course looked high-quality, and we enjoyed the ambiance of Roy's overlooking the green. We used the spa while we were there and really enjoyed it as well.

We like to go to Hawaii to relax, so the beach scene? Not our thing. We chose the Ihilani over the Kahala because it had better rooms for the price, though I think we may try the Kahala next time. First off, the room was absolutely divine. Perhaps just a smidge on the small side for the price, but otherwise--in perfect condition, well-maintained, tastefully decorated, etc. We were fortunate to get a deluxe room on the 17th (highest) floor, with an absolutely gorgeous view of the lagoon. We didn't have sunrise or sunset views, which was a pity, but it was lovely anyway. It was also lovely to close just the screen door every night and have the sound of the waves sing us to sleep. It was also nice to have padded furniture, including a lounge chair, on our lanai. We ate most of our meals at the Naupaka Terrace, their cafe. Although cafe is really a misnomer for it, as this was some of the best food I've ever had. I mean EVER. Even some of the fanciest tablecloth restaurants around couldn't rival them for sheer food quality. I was seriously impressed. I'm not a food snob (one of our meals that week came from Burger King and another from Denny's, so there) but I do know when someone knows what they're doing with the basics. And that chef KNEW. Wow. We didn't ever get to Azul, their higher-end place, but I suspect we may have had to have been carted out of there on stretchers if we did, after going catatonic from food heaven. Also very cool is their little man-made lagoon (one of four at the Ko Olina resort.) It's perfectly designed so there are next to no waves, and only a few small sea critters floating around. Some folks even had their toddlers there, showing them the cute little blue crabs that live on the rocks near the breakwater. Now, for the downsides (and there are some, sadly.) First of all, the location is definitely a little odd. The resort is on the dry, desert-like leeward side of the island, which means it's a chunk of artificially created oasis in the middle of scrub. It's also just down the beach from a major chemical processing plant and port. Kind of cool if you like watching frieghters being guided in by tugboats, but kind of ugly if you'd rather not see chemical mixing tanks on your otherwise-beautiful horizon. Also, the resort--primarily centered around the Ko Olina golf course, along with the Ihilani and the Marriott timeshare just down the road--does tend to cater to a certain kind of...hmm... upscale, conservative sort of crowd. The hubster and I are financially comfortable, but we're also somewhat on the crunchy liberal and low-BS side too, and at times, I kind of felt a bit out of place in my Target shoes among the Chanel bags and designer polo shirts. We aren't trashy slobs or anything, just perhaps a little less gated-community sorts than most of those frequenting the place. We would never, for instance, have behaved like the entitled wench who berated (loudly) the restaurant's host for not seating her whiny brood with a water view. (Clearly, they were the only customers that mattered in the place!) I suppose the best way to explain this issue is to point out that the hotel has a small network of ponds/lagoons on property, with a collection of fish and a few small sharks and stingrays. Not necessarily unusual for resorts like this, but in this one, it really looked like the poor creatures just weren't at all happy in their artificial environment. The stingrays, for instance, had had their barbs amputated, and one of them looked like the stump was infected and irritated. Poor guy. Overall, it seemed like they weren't being taken care of in an animal conservation sort of sense, they were just there in a Let's Dominate Wildlife! sort of way. A small issue, to be sure, given the overall quality of the place, but it did kind of gnaw at the back of my mind. If one can overlook these sorts of issues (and I mostly could) it's a terrific place. Great customer service, great rooms and a great location if you're not into the nutty city life thing. Do definitely rent a car, though, because you'll probably want to go into Kapolei if you want to grab snacks or do other sorts of shopping or off-property meals. Also, one last note: I highly recommend doing the wildlife-watching boat tours offered by Wildside Eco-Adventures, which is just down the road about 20 minutes or so from the resort.

This was my second go around at Ko Olina. The first time was at the Marriott\u2019s Ko Olina Beach Club. I don\u2019t want to bore you with details of my travel experience, but I have elite status with all major hotel chains. I travel a great deal, and I\u2019m only writing this review, because if I was going to bring my family to the Ihilani, I would want to know these details. I wouldn\u2019t be so critical of a hotel in general, except this one advertises itself as a high-end resort/hotel. First the positive: JW Marriott is on a great location. It has fantastic semi-private lagoons. In general, it\u2019s a modern hotel with good common areas including a nice pool. (Nothing fancy but the pool is clean and does the job) It has nice fish ponds and a separate pond for sting rays and sharks. It also has good restaurants. Rooms were above-average sized and well appointed (bit out-dated) with all the basic necessities of a 4 star hotel. (If you think this is a 5-star, you\u2019re out of your mind) Fitness center missed a couple of specialized equipment, but had everything I needed. It has a separate lap pool for the swimmers. I own timeshare with Marriott and typically stay at the hotel portion between 40-60 nights per year. I have trouble believing a Marriott category 7 hotel can be operated in this fashion. Room: As soon as I entered the room, it hit me: A strange and unforgettable odor. It\u2019s a cross between fresh paint and cat urine, more the latter. We aired the room overnight to no avail. They granted us a room change, but the new room had the same problem albeit to a lesser extent. I later discovered it was in the air conditioning. Both rooms were extremely dirty. Dirt/dust everywhere, hairs (not ours) on the bathroom floors and entrance, and food particles in plain sight. Both rooms were the same. Some areas of the rooms look like they haven\u2019t been clean in years. Bugs!!! I stayed a week in Kauai before coming here, but didn\u2019t have any insect problems while staying at an outdoor resort. JW is an enclosed hotel, and we were on a high floor. We had silverfish, mosquitos, gnats of varing size and flies. The problem got so bad, I went to the local Wal-Mart for an insect candle. Our fourth night, we discovered a huge trail of sugar ants from the balcony to the opposite end of the room. We found ants in the bedding and other furniture. When ants are found on the 14th floor, you have to suspect the problem is not localized. Parking: They charged me $30.37 per night. I know what you\u2019re thinking...you could always do without a car or not stay there. True...However, when I made my reservation, my confirmation email showed a parking fee of $19/night. In a matter of two months, they raised $10. Second, this hotel is in a rather remote location, you really can\u2019t do without a car when you\u2019re with your family. Since they\u2019re the only game in town, you have to pay the extortion. I\u2019ll gladly pay a parking fee which is a result of supply and demand. This is something very different. JW has a relatively large parking structure with lots of empty slots. For the money, stay at the Marriott\u2019s Ko Olina Beach Club.

Beach access was great to the private calm lagoon. Plenty of chairs and was never very busy. Cabana rentals were available for $35/day, but we just opted for an umbrella and chairs. The restaurants served great food, but the prices were a bit high. The prime rib was AMAZING!! Room service was VERY fast, but again kind of pricey. Complimentary snorkel/fin, kayak and hammock boat rental for 1 hour a day was nice. Cons - Everything costs extra. You'd think for spending over $500/night you'd get to park your car or access the internet for free. Parking is $30/day for both self parking and valet. Internet is an additional $13/day. $100/day extra for an ocean view room. Tips are somewhat expected for everything. We took advantage of the complimentary hammock boat rental and when I signed the form for the rental the staff made sure they pointed out the \u201cgratuity\u201d line on the form for their help in renting the equipment. Noise from the pool late at night might be a bit much for some, but eliminating it was as simple as closing your sliding doors. The spa is very expensive and didn\u2019t seem worth it.

It was my honeymoon. I called several months in advance to find out if they could guarantee me a deluxe ocean view room overlooking the pool. I wanted that view because I've stayed at the Ihilani twice before, and found out that rooms that face north west get exposed to a spot next to the hotel that often has parties during the day and sometimes late at night, playing loud music. I called the hotel directly and they said they could guarantee the deluxe ocean view I wanted if made in advance. So when I had my dates ready I called reservations and specifically told them the view I wanted. I told them it was my honeymoon and that I knew that there was loud music on the north west side of the hotel. They said they could do it and got even more specific by asking what floor I wanted. I told them the 7th would be fine. I called the hotel directly again about a week later to verify the reservation (though in fairness I don't recall if I again mentioned the specific view I wanted). This was done 3-4 months in advance of my trip. For $417 a night I wanted the same spectacular view I had had in the past. I could step onto the balcony and see the 4 lagoons south of the hotel, and the room was private. Nobody could see into my room from another balcony so I could lay on the bed in my underwear with the windows open getting that awesome ocean breeze. When I got to my room, and realized it was not overlooking the pool, but instead faced north west, I called the front desk. They told me there were no deluxe ocean view rooms available overlooking the pool with a king bed....only twin beds. Plus, when I told them about my reservation they said there was nothing in the notes of my reservation indicating the view I wanted. So then I called the same number that was on the email from my reservation, and had them look up my reservation. They said there was no mention of my request overlooking pool, and then said that if I had requested the reservation specialist to 'put my request in the notes' then they would have. I said how am I supposed to know that I have to specifically tell them to put my request in the notes. The woman just said that some reservation specialists will just do it on their own, but some won't unless you ask them to. LAME!!! So for two nights I heard drumming and singing, one until 10pm. And during the day their was a party. Plus the guy next door came out on his balcony and turned around and looked right into our room where my wife and I were laying. The food at the hotel was excellent. The room was very nice except for the location. The phone system didn't work correctly, so even after I retrieved a phone message, it kept blinking that I had a message. I called the front desk twice and they deleted the message, but it kept blinking so I just left it. The mini fridge was empty and barely cool which made me feel like they were trying to do things on the cheap. The other times I stayed there, it was stocked with drinks and candy bars, etc. The pool was great. The staff well trained and friendly, especially the concierges. bottom line: when I go to paradise and pay $417 + 30 (room tax) + 20 (G.E. tax) + 19 (parking tax) = $486 a day, I expect more.

There were no other cars or guests waiting for their cars so I can't imagine why a 4 star hotel wouldn't offer a more efficient valet service. We've stayed at the Kahala were the car is always waiting for us upon request and the valet and their clerks makes conversation with us instead of their co-workers.

Well designed so that you felt connected to the rest of the resort, but not 'in the middle' of it. Beach -- Great lagoons, a lot of beach-per-person. This definitely IS NOT Waikiki. GREAT snorkeling. I saw more marine life here than I did SCUBA diving. Food/Dining -- Sushi bar is great. My wife and I don't eat shellfish, so we talked with the waitress (Hi Belinda!) and the chef for a while and they custom made a huge platter of sushi for us.

We mainly snorkeled in lagoons one and two (which are the closest to the hotel).. .saw great fish, and sea turtles ... very close~! the hotel's staff were all great~! we never encountered a problem with the service. all staff were very helpful and VERY nice. the hotel is clean, spaceous. we loved our partial ocean view room with balcony. The beds are super (we are picky about bed quality.. nothing makes a vacation turn out poorly than if you have a bad bed to sleep in or a bad sunburn~!) the pool is small, but since that wasn't something we were \"into\" it did not matter to us. we were all about going down and staying on the beach all day. anyway, we would definitely go back to this hotel. And I am very picky with where we stay at in terms of quality, cleanliness, and service. This hotel was GREAT~! loved it. wish we could go back every year. tip~! GET THE breakfast buffet INCLUDED in your package. we did and we very happy we did that... it is a GREAT buffet.. huge , lots of choices.. the items do NOT change at all from day to day but b/c it is so big , if you are staying there a week it will not matter. The price is $28 per person. so ya, get it included in your package if at all possible~! it is well worth it. my husband and I ate the buffet mid morning, then only needed one more meal the rest of the day. do rent a car if possible, esp if you want to go see the rest of the island. which we highly recommend doing the war memorials and driving up to the NORTH SHORE and the eastern and southern part of the island. on the other hand, if you just want to go someplace, stay there and not move around. I would do that at this hotel too. I recommend this for couples and families both. This time of year was perfect to go~! not crowded at all.. and the weather warm and water perfect. We did a snorkeling / dolphin / whale watching boat trip one of the days out of the Ko Olina boat dock area which is just down the road from the hotel. you can book the package at the hotel and get free shuttle to and from the boat dock. The package I thought was expensive. we ended up paying about $255 for two people for a 4 hour cruise. in my opinion the place they took us to for snorkeling was just ok... I had better snorkeling in the lagoons free right outside the hotel~! but it was worth it to see that part of the island from the water, ride the boat and we did see many dolphins at play PLUS a mama and baby whale~!~! that was super , was they surfaced quiet close to the boat. very thrilling. If you want night life, crowds, and tourists.. stay in Honolulu.. if you want more secluded, quiet and restful, I say this hotel is the best~! you can still go to Honolulu if you want for dining, etc. it's just a 20 minute drive away.. but it's away enough so that you feel away and not packed in with hundreds of other tourists.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel In a Remote Location - Get a Car\u201d", "Author": "SouthMiami", "ReviewID": "UR15484283", "Content": "Beautiful hotel and beach area.

It certainly seemed a family friendly resort to me. No one minded the happy laughter and play of the well-behaved children I saw there. The only problem we encountered was with a dolphin adventure excursion out of the nearby marina that had nothing to do with the resort.. The crew was unprofessional and inexperienced, dropping passengers in the open ocean and then dropping anchor 100 yards away in a position that had the passengers struggling to swim back to the boat against the ocean current rather than dropping anchor on the low side of the current to allow the passengers to drift and swim back to the boat with the current. The inexperienced \"first mate\" stumbled around on deck and even shoved my young daughter from the boat into the ocean very near a reef and the boat's metal ladder and motor/propellers.

It was our first trip to Hawaii for myself, husband, and 2 kids, ages 5 and 7. We stayed at the JW Marriott for 2 nights during the first leg of our tour. The hotel is definitely away from the hustle and bustle and is in a residential area. I\u2019ve read pros and cons about this, but my advice would be not to book the hotel if you want to be near Waikiki. It is a nice hotel to get away from it all. The pool was a bit small and just one depth. This was nice for the kids, but a little ho-hum for the adults. The beach area was beautiful and the lagoon was really nice. Great for both kids and adults. There is snorkeling there, but you have to swim out a bit and there is no lifeguard there. I was a little weary about swimming out to where the lagoon met the ocean, as it was late in the day and I was by myself with no life vest, so I only stayed in the immediate lagoon area for a little bit and saw a couple fish, nothing exciting. My husband stayed out a little while longer than I but did not see anything different. The room was fantastic. Plenty of room to spread out and beautifully decorated. Service was top-notch. The only complaint I have was that since the hotel was geared more for adults (i.e., the spa and golf course), we got a bit of a look (or sneer) from some of the guests when our kids were in the pool. The kids were splashing a bit (each other, not other guests) and were a little loud (as kids in pools are, not screaming). All in all, they were being kids in a pool on vacation, but as they were the only kids around, we seemed to get \u201cthe look\u201d from other guests.

The one week wasn't too much of a honeymoon---we were up early in the morning, trying to make the best of seeing what we can while the ship was docked, and combined with having a lousy cruise experience. One thing we wanted to do though was spend a few days at the end of the cruise relaxing in Oahu. After one week of hectic touring, we wanted some solitude and relaxation. And JW delivered! The rooms were spectacularly clean; service was impeccable; beach was gorgeous; and the lagoons were amazing (we actually spotted more fish there then paying for a snorkeling trip elsewhere).

However, I must say we still spent quite a bit staying there. It is really sad that no matter how much a hotel room costs they still have fees for just about everything inside and outside the room. My husband plays tennis, so to use the tennis courts there was a fee. I believe it was about $20 each time or $40 for a week. Even if they arrange a match with a club member, there is still a fee. There is a fee to use the lagoon equipment (i.e. kayak, etc), a fee to use the covered lounge chairs at the beach, a $12 fee per day to connect to the internet\u2026don\u2019t even ask how much the fee was to use the golf course\u2026fortunately neither of us play.

The room was essentially the same as the regular rooms just larger...even the bathroom was exactly the same just slightly larger. The mini bar is totally packed with very pricey drinks. I heard that there is a fee (once again) to have them unload it so that there is space to put your own things in it. Only maybe 2 or 3 smaller water bottles will fit without removing things. The lagoon is great and perfect for families with small children. People even saw turtles in the lagoon which is nice. The hotel grounds are beautiful and the food at the restaurants was very nice.

We tried 2 of the 3 restaurants on the JW Marriott property (I mean where else are you going to eat?). The main dining room was first class, very nice but no view. The terrace restaurant was semi-open air and we had breakfast and a late lunch there. The terrace was a bit spotty as far as service. The busman was disassembling the salad bar and was quite loud. The room was spacious, well appointed, beautiful bathroom, and lanai with a great view of the ocean and some of the coastline. It was a VERY nice room. Valet service was efficient, checkin was prompt, friendly, helpful. The fitness center was very nice with quality equipment and in clean setting. If this is your first trip to Oahu, this is probably NOT the place to stay. If you arrive late afternoon, you're in rush hour traffic going to the hotel.

My husband & I stayed for 7 nights January 6-12, 2008. We used our Marriott Reward points with an upgrade to an oceanview room. The hotel is situated right on the water. Our room had an true ocean view. The room was quite large (king bed, sofa and armchair, plus a desk/chair and cocktail table). There was a small, separate entryway that had a lovely chest, with mini bar, safe and storage. The bathroom was superb. Two sinks/vanities on separate walls, giving you lots of space to put toiletries. A very large tub, and a separate shower with big seat/shelf. All very new and well kept. The pool and pool area is small by most standards and was probably very crowded over the holiday season. But we visited in January so there were plenty of lounge chairs available. The beach is nice with lots of chairs. The water is in a lagoon and good for children to swim in. Everything was very well maintained. There are 3 restaurants; Azul (expensive), Asian (didn't try it), and a large all day dining one. Our first night we ate at Azul and were disappointed. Prices were very high, wine prices were ridiculous and service was terrible. We felt extremely rushed. Then we discovered the Roy's Restaurant down the block (within walking distance). Can't say enough about what great food and service !! And far less expensive. Try the fixe price menu; great value and the chocolate souffle (really a lava cake) is out of this world. We tried Azul one more time and told the waitress of our unhappy experience the first time. She slowed down the pace of the meal and we happily found a great reasonably priced red wine. We must have overlooked it the first time. The food were served in a more leisurely pace and it was all prepared very well. They comped our dessert to make up for our first experience, which was nice. There is a lovely walk along the water that features several lagoons. It is well paved and lots of water fountains and rest rooms along the way. In about 20 minutes, you can reach the Marriott Vacation Club, which is just being built. Two buildings out of 4 are up already. Very high density and family oriented. Beautiful pools but if you are looking for a relaxing time, stay at the Marriott Ihilani.

We arrived a check-in time to find one room ready and the other not...not terrible, but frustrating after a 6-hour flight. It seemed to take forever for housekeeping to finish up, and we didn't get into the second room for about 2 hours.

The rooms were large, bright and had wonderful balconies. We had corner rooms on the 10th floor with 2 balconies each, and the lanais were good for viewing whales and the nightly hula show. Considering prices for rooms in other places, it seemed fairly reasonable. What was NOT reasonable was the way the hotel socks it to you at every possible opportunity. Fees upon taxes upon surcharges...$18 per night for parking, and then a tax on top of that! They tried to charge both rooms for parking even though we only had one car! The mini bar, room service and restaurant prices were much higher than usual...$28 per person for a mediocre breakfast buffet, with no other cheaper options nearby. We ate in all 3 of the hotel's restaurants and found them to be good but not great and too expensive. Service was usually pleasant and at least competent. One rather nasty feature is the business center which charged the highest per-MINUTE rate I have ever seen to go online. 5 minutes' worth to check E-mail cost me nearly $7! The beach/lagoon is pleasant enough and especially good for families. Don't plan on doing any body surfing; they are man-made and still as bathtubs. There is pretty good snorkeling, although high surf beyond the breakwaters pushed in a lot of sand and made things rather murky. The pool area is OK, albeit a bit crowded.

I would definately suggest renting a car because depending on your length of stay, there isn't a whole lot around the resort area except for relaxing or golfing. The restaurant choices at the hotel are decent. They have a beach and poolside grill, which serves ok food, at least the drinks are nice. They also have a outdoor restaurant called the Naupaka Terrace that serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food was good, especially the spicy chicken lettuce wraps. The portions are large, so if you're looking for a light lunch, maybe sharing a plate wouldn't be too bad of an idea. The fanciest restaurant is Azul located next to Naupaka Terrace. The food is better there, but unfortunately the service was lacking the night that we went. It's not that the waitress wasn't trying, but they only had one bus person for the whole restaurant. When we finally got our food, it was good, although I have to say that some of the pairings that the chef had suggested in serving the food, like Lemoncelio with our chocolate dessert, was odd. Stay away from the organic chicken, it was really dry! They do have a sushi restaurant, but the night we wanted to go there it was closed, I will have to say that if you want good sushi, go to Nobu in Honolulu in the lobby of the Parc Hotel, it was fantastic!! We had all the suggestions that our waitress had recommended and she didn't fail us. The resort itself is nice. They have a pool, which was a little small, but ok for the kids. The beach is nice and you can reserve cabana seats for a fee (I think $40 for 2 lounges). That does include a cooler with a couple pieces of fruit and two water bottles. We enjoyed the beach more than the pool. The kids used the kayaks a couple of times. I believe that you can also get complimentary snorkel gear from concession on the beach.

Telephone greetings were always professional, as they greet you by name on the phone. -Great location for people with kids and for those who want to get away from the hustle of Waikiki. We stayed at the Halekulani last year and it was very nice, but there weren't that many other kids around, mostly young couples. Also, I personally do not like the crowds in Waikiki. All of the commotion detracts from the resort-I am on a vacation atmosphere (my opinion). When you go to Waikiki, you will see what I mean. I live in Tokyo and the strip on Waikiki is more crowded. -There is a KMart about 2 miles down the road on H1 East (exit 1B). So if you travel light in order to buy things on location, it is convenient. -Beach was very nice as was the lagoon. It was not too crowded and the beach was very clean. -Food at the resort was good, but you will pay for it (it IS a resort). Now the bad: -We were planning to arrive at 7am on Dec 29th, therefore we decided to pay for a room starting on Dec 28th, so that immediately upon check in, we could shower, unpack, tend to our 4 yr old and 1 yr old baby. When we arrived we discovered that the hotel had given our room to someone else on Dec 28th, even though we had a confirmed reservation AND they knew we were going to actually check in at 7am on Dec 29th. When I asked about the reason, they said they needed to give it to somone else (they must have known that it would inconvenience us because they said they were fully booked and the people in our room were not scheduled to check out until 12 noon). I was astounded by this. They gave us a choice to wait until the afternoon for our original room or to take a similar room on the 4th floor which would be ready \"in a couple of hours\". It still irks me just thinking about it. We decided to wait for our original room. So there were were at 7am, just off a 12 hour flight with a 4 year old and a 1 year old, waiting in the lobby with all our luggage for 6 hours. The only thing they offered us was complimenatry coffee (which is free anyway). -I agree with some others on this board that the pool was freezing. Other guests I talked to complained of the same thing. Even on the sunny, 80 F days, the pool was pretty empty except for the kids. -The staff are professional, but only a handful really projected a warmth and sincerity. I felt that they were just tired of all the tourists. The staff at the Halekulani last year were a little better, but not by much. We also stayed in Maui 2 years ago at both the Sheraton Maui and at the Westin Maui. The Sheraton's staff had the Aloha spirit in spades. The staff there were genuinely friendly and made for a real resort atmosphere. The Westin was much like the Halekulani and this hotel...professional, but missing sincerity. I guess I would be tired too if I had to deal with tourists 365 days a year. If I hadn't stayed at the Sheraton Maui, then I wouldn't have known there is something better out there.

The biggest weak points I noticed were the somewhat sterile and dated lobby/atrium and the ho-hum pool, which can\u2019t compete at all with the surrounding gardens, beach and fish ponds. Also, the hotel charges for their Internet connection and don\u2019t think of staying here long without a car. The rooms were large, spotless and fresh looking, with bathrooms with separate showers and Jacuzzi tubs and beds that were very comfortable. The manufactured bay makes easy swimming, even when the ocean is rough or you are with children. The three restaurants plus pool bar offer a nice range of eating choices, although nothing is cheap.

There were many signs of wear and tear as well as signifigant mold in the shower area. The property clearly suffers from delayed maintenance. I aggree with many of the other reviews. It is located a long way out of the activity zone of Waikiki beach. If you came to Hawaii expecting to just chill out at the beach it is an ok choice, but, if you seek any kind of nightlife I urge you to not book this property.

We also stayed at the Four Seasons on both Lanai and Maui and there are reviews on those locations posted as well. My impression of the JW Marriott at Ko Olina was that it was ok, but it was also marred by two incidents which I will detail below. As a Marriott Rewards Member we had a ton of points to use so we got 5 free nights at this hotel to start our Hawaiian adventure, paying only a small fee each night to upgrade to an ocean view. We arrived late (about 10pm) to a very basic check-in (no leis or anything). We were starving so I asked where we could get something to eat. I was told the only place was the lounge and it would be closing soon as well. By the time we unloaded our luggage in our room and got to the lounge we were told we had our choice of only three things on the menu - altogether not a good first impression. The resort is about 20 minutes from the airport and about 40 minutes from Waikiki. Although its nice to be away from crowds of Waikiki, just keep in mind that if you don't want to spend most of your time on the resort you will have to drive almost a half hour or more to go anywhere. Our room was nice with a very large bathroom, making the size of the room a little on the small side. I had requested a refrigerator in the room since we were traveling with our kids and that had to be put in the bathroom, where the coffee maker was located as well. It was an odd arrangement - I know people love that wow factor of a huge bathroom, but at what cost? The ocean view was wonderful, though. Since the hotel is on a man-made lagoon the water here is very calm, perfect for small kids or people who don't like waves. The sand is somewhat rocky with bits of coral in it, probably going back to the whole man-made process and not having hundreds of years to weather and soften. There are no services at the beach unless you rent a cabana, so you need to get your own towels from the pool area to bring to the beach, try to lay claim to one of the half dozen or so permanently afixed thatch umbrellas if you want shade and then walk back up again to the pool area if you want a ice water or something to eat. For something different, take a walk along the shore away from the lagoon (to the north), there is a rocky beach that has tons of little tidal pools where you can see fish, crabs and snails. The pool is perfectly round with stairs at either end meaning most people, especially kids crowding at the edges. The pool deck seemed to be small. I know the hotel was not full while we were there, yet the pool deck always seemed crowded. Also, they were working on the grout around the pool deck everyday, so there were cones and caution tape up on one or two sections of the pool deck everyday we were there. What was nice were the fish ponds under the lobby, my kids loved trying to pick out the sharks, sting rays and starfish. We ate one night in the Japanese restaurant when they had their buffet and it was ok. The breakfast were delicious though - carmelized banana french toast - yum! Breakfast buffet was about $30, entrees about $15-$20 for breakfast and lunch, Dinner entrees about $20-$35. Tropical drinks are $8.50, pretty good for a resort on Hawaii. The hotel is also a short walk away from Roy's, which is a fabulous restaurant - I highly recommend it! Service was good, not great but not bad either. It did not seem like anyone went above and beyond, as demonstrated by the two incidents I hinted at earlier. The first were the additional guests in our room. From the moment we checked in we saw a creepy critter on our floor. I had heard stories about bugs in hotel rooms in Hawaii and this was only one so we let it go, but the next day we say another, then another. My husband complained to the front desk who said they would check into it. Never any follow up after that and we still found one the day before we left. Second, I realzed after the 25 minute flight over to Lanai after checking out that I had left my camera battery charger behind. In a panic I called the hotel to describe the item and advise exactly were it had been left They informed me the housekeeping staff was not done their rounds and when they were they would contact me. They did call back to say nothing had been found. I hung up the phone but after thinking about it I called back and ask to speak to a manager, again gaving very specific instructions as to the exact outlet it was plugged in to. I was told the room would be specifically checked and I would get a call back. By the next day I called again since I hadn't heard anything and now had to tell the tale all over again to someone new. Again the room was to be specifically checked and I was told to call back. I did and supposedly nothing was found. I was quite irritated by this since I called them within a couple of hours of leaving the room and I know that charger was right in that socket so it was clearly stolen by someone. I don't like leaving a bad review just because of a specific incident or incidents, but my overall impression of the hotel was not too great to begin with so add that other stuff on top and now I would not go back or recommend it.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotts Valley, California", "Title": "\u201cVery enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "nrbailey", "ReviewID": "UR10486498", "Content": "We spent 5 nights at the beautiful Ihilani in early October and were very pleased with everything.

Ihilani Resort & Spa for our honeymoon. We both had fabulous time and felt that the resort provided us with a wonderful experience. The staff was friendly and attentive, housekeeping provided impeccable cleaning services and our view from the room (partial ocean view) was gorgeous. With that said, we would like to highlight some of the memorable things we did while keeping in mind that this is a category seven Marriott hotel, (so expect to pay a pretty penny). If you have a rental car, parking is $18 per day at the resort and movies can be rented for around $13 a piece. Drinks at the Poolside Bar average at $8/ piece, while food is around $12. I felt that both food & drink was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Things to Do: We highly recommend trying the breakfast buffet at the resort, which is served daily at the Naupaka Terrace. Cost is around $26/ person and includes a wonderful selection of food including turkish sausage, eggs benedict, bacon, pastries, fresh fruit, gouda cheese & meats, a \"made to order\" omelet station, and perhaps my favorite, a juice bar, where you could add different combinations of fruit to a blender to create your own personalized fruit smoothie. We splurged and got massages at the Spa, which has provided its services to celebrities like John Travolta and other NFL players. I received an aromatherapy massage ($125 + $25 gratuity tip), while my husband got a reflexology foot massage ($140 + $28 gratuity tip). If you purchase a spa package, you also receive complimentary access to its other services (needle shower, sauna etc...) for the rest of the day. Otherwise, it is a $20 fee per day for access to the spa. We felt it was well worth it, if you can afford it. Go go the Fia Fia Luau. My husband had previously attended the Paradise Cove Luau on a past trip and felt that this luau was exceptionally better. The food was delicious, our host was entertaining, and they only accepted approximately 200 people (at the most), making for a much more personalized experience. Reservations can be made with the concierge at the Marriott Beach Resort (next door). The luau is held on Tuesdays and costs $70 per person. For a romantic dinner out, try Roy's (at the Resort) or Alan Wong's (Honolulu). The average meal ranges from around $30-52. Both places had excellent food and celebrated our honeymoon by giving us free dessert, that was decorated exquisitely. Tour Pearl Harbor -- The U.S. Arizona tour is free and opens at 7:30 a.m. I would recommend getting the headset, which is $5 per person, and provides you with a narrative as you tour the site. Climb Diamond Head -- Parking is $5 for the day and the view is worth the hike. Tips: Kapolei is 10 minutes away from the resort and offers wonderful meal selections at affordable rates. My husband & I got all-you-can-eat pancakes, 1 meat, & 1 egg selection from the Hapa Grill for breakfast one morning for around $10.00 total for both of us.

We stayed for a total of 6 nights. We had an Ocean View room and the view was really nice. The lanai overlooked the pool and one of the lagoons. It was very peaceful in the mornings and we would eat our breakfast there. It was very noisy at night as there was usually music by the pool. The room doors, once shut, absolutely shut out the noise ... but it's hard to just relax on the lanai in the early evenings. For $13 / day you can have high-speed wired Internet in the room. No wireless connection worked for us (only one was available, but I believe it was secure ... so, not free). Fairly steep and no weekly option was available. We rented a car the week we were there and there's really no other way to do it. Part of the allure of the Ilihani was being in a nice, peaceful setting (ie, not Waikiki). But we still wanted to get around and go to North Shore, Diamond Head, Waikiki for a day, etc. Plus we're very much \"chain restaurant\" people and Kapolei is only 5-10 minutes away and has a good variety of familiar restaurants (Outback being our favorite). We also got a mini-fridge for the room and got supplies at Safeway (also in Kapolei) to have cheaper drinks and snacks. One night while we were there we decided to get some floaties and watch the sunset in the lagoon. It was a great idea until we noticed a lot of commotion over on the shore and a very large animal was in the surf. As we started swimming towards shore we saw that it was a full-grown seal that was making its way onto the beach. We decided that if the sea creatures were fleeing the water that we probably should too, so we missed the sunset. We asked the hotel official that was keeping tourists away from the seal if that was a regular occurance and he said it was the first time he had ever seen such a thing. So, rare as it may be, remember that swimming in the lagoons is the same as swimming in the ocean, and large animals CAN make it in there with you, however rare it may be. We also did the hotel's \"Reef and Ray Adventure\" and fed the fish, baby hammerheads, and stingrays. Feeding the fish is, well, throwing pellets at water. The lady was informative and friendly, but feeding fish is feeding fish. The hammerheads were a bit more interesting. You stand behind a small rock wall (so as not to be bitten) and throw fish chunks at them. Very similar to feeding the other fish, except these are sharks. And sharks are cool. After that we fed the stingrays. There are two adults and two babies. The babies swim right up next to you and to feed them you have to place the food on your hand, submerge your hand to the bottom of the shallow pool, and they glide over you and suck the food up. Really fun! The adult feeding is more complex to explain, but still extremely fun and you're right there in the water with them. No real barrier, and they swim right up to you. I highly suggest doing this activity if you're an animal lover, as it is a very unique experience. We got some massages at the spa. The spa is VERY nice and has all sorts of stuff that was available for free aside from the massage ... jacuzzi, sauna, 360 degree shower, a cold water dunk tank right next to the spa (I thought that was a kid thing??) etc etc. The massage itself wasn't anything spectacular, but then again I'm not really a massage person. We were suckered into the timeshare presentation the first day we got there. I understand why they do it, but it's a bit disappointing to be spending so much at a resort and having the employees there give you a sales pitch for things like that. Overall, it was a very relaxing way to begin our honeymoon. Oahu is a fun island, with tons of stuff to do (especially if you have a car). There's a lot outside of Waikiki that others may miss.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place for a Family\u201d", "Author": "NRS6", "ReviewID": "UR8654461", "Content": "We had a great time here.

We left the property only for a trip to North Beach and a Ko Olina Catamaran morning trip. I had called the property directly for reservations and I was given a great room with 2 lanai's overlooking both ocean and mountains. The kids ate free at the Naupaka Terrace. Azul is very good.There is a restaurant just outside and few restaurants just a couple of exits away. The only trick was getting back on the highway. They all cost around the same.North Beach is just 20 minutes away and worth a trip, with Dole plantation on the way. If you want to enjoy the beach and pool and hang out, this is the perfect place. If you want to tour the island, and looking for night life, you are better off elsewhere. The lagoon rents water hammocks, kayaks, peddle boats etc. Come early enough you have plenty of spots with shade and you can drag the beach chairs. In season pool is full of kids and families have a good time. There is a pool on the upper floor of the Spa for adults only, where my wife went every morning. The pools are only 3 to 4 feet deep and there is no lifeguard. Spa facility is great and you can use the facilty for a basic fee (free with a treatment). The Hanuama bay snorkeling is supposed to be good but has limited parking and after early arrivals fill the spots, they close it. So we went snorkeling on the catamaran trip, which is average. Marriott has time share buildings and each has its own man made lagoons (4 of them), all next to each other. You can walk to these.

My husband and 19 month old son were also on the trip. When we first arrived, we were about an hour early for the 3 pm check-in, so we had to wait around until they called us when our room was ready. This took about half an hour, so not too bad. When we got to our room, it was on the 4th floor (which is really the first floor above the lobby) and it was pretty much the last room on that side of the hotel. Not only that, but we had a lovely view of a roof/wall from our patio. Needless to say, we asked for a change of room right away. After a few phonecalls and threatening to go to another hotel, we were moved to an acceptable room on the 10th floor. The hotel itself is quite nice, but I wouldn't say extremely luxurious. It's very clean, nice bathrooms, common areas and lobby. We had a package which included breakfast and I have to say that was really good. There are many choices in the buffet and I would recommend getting a breakfast package if you can. The pool was a little small, although we never really spent time there, as there is a private lagoon right behind the hotel. This lagoon was very beautiful, no waves, and great for small children. Most of our time was spent there. The hotel is located about 20-30 minutes from Waikiki, so if you want to be in the middle of the action, you shouldn't stay here. But we were ok with being further out, as it is more quiet and secluded. But the dining options in the area are limited. There are basically all the fast food places and a couple of more decent restaurants, but that's about it. You will have to drive to get anywhere exciting, so getting a car is highly recommended. As we were with an energetic toddler, we didn't do much sightseeing, so I can't really comment on that. There are some shopping centers on the island, including the Ala Moana center which is the nicest, but again this is closer to Waikiki. Overall, I would say the hotel is quite nice, very clean, the staff was just ok, and the lagoon is gorgeous. But it is out of the way, and there is not much to do around there, so be aware of that when booking. For a nice quiet place, this is good, although it is not exactly cheap.

This resort is GREAT for families and children (which wasn't our focus since we don't have kids, but it should be pointed out!). The snorkeling is far from great around the lagoons, but if you just want to put some fins on and swim around for fun, its fine. I'm sure some guests miss out on this part so I am adding another note: If you walk out towards the ocean on the right of the lagoon (facing the water), make a hard right and walk north along the path. There is a sign that says 'you are leaving the resort grounds' (or something similar), and keep going down onto the beach. There is a nature (not man made) lagoon here with a little beach. It feels much more wild and natural than the resort lagoons!

We know Hawaii is a destination for lots of honeymooners and we did not go in expecting special service or a room upgrade. BUT, since the hotel contacted us a few days before our stay and asked us to complete a questionnaire including a question about whether it was a special occasion, we assumed there would be some congratulatory note or mention when we arrived. INSTEAD we were greeted with an offer to UPGRADE for a hefty price, not once but TWICE. AND the wrong type of room -- based on our repeatedly confirmed requests -- TWICE. It wasn't until we asked to speak to a manager that there was (miraculously) a room available that met all of our confirmed requests. This is a beautiful hotel. Our room, once we finally got to it, was lovely and the beach off the lagoon is SO nice. But a good hotel experience has as much to do with the service received as it does with the building and grounds. I have never felt so nickel and dimed as I did at this hotel. The hotel definitely used its remote surroundings to squeeze every penny out of us -- ridiculous given the prices charged for the rooms. When we returned from our honeymoon I noticed an unauthorized charge on my credit card from the hotel for over $150. When I called the hotel, I was informed this was for mini bar charges (we never opened the mini bar). I understand a hotel running a few dollars worth of charges from the mini bar without first contacting a customer -- but $150 must have been the WHOLE mini bar. I think a call was warranted in this case BEFORE the charge rather than requiring the customer to review her credit card statement and then dispute such a large charge.

This was our 13th trip to the islands, where we have stayed in some premier locations. This resort was just as lovely as many of the other highly rated, but at least half of the cost. The hotel is off by itself on the western shore, so if you are into nightlife, you might find it too quiet. What the hotel lacks in activity, it makes up for with the rooms and service at a relatively reasonable price. The room we were upgraded to for free was a huge two bedroom suite, with a lovely entrance hall and a very large bathroom, comparable to the Four Seasons, but even larger. There were two separate vanities, one with a stool to sit at the make-up mirror. There was a wrap around lanai, with views of the mountains and ocean. It would have been nice to have two lounge chairs instead of one so my husband and I could enjoy lounging outside at the same time. There was a teak table and two chairs as well. The housekeeper, Cynthia, kept our room well stocked and spotless. The hotel is on a calm, man -made lagoon, which was nice for the paddle rafts and water hammock my daughters and I rented, and we were not charged a fortune to use these as some other resorts do. If you like ocean waves, you will be disappointed as there aren't any for body surfing or bugie boards. There were some tiki huts on the beach to offer shade, so get to the beach early if you want to use one, and we loved relaxing on the hammock set between two palm trees. The infinity pool was not large, but was never crowded. Great lounge chairs with padded cushions. Service was terrific with pool attendants offering cold water and shaved ice. When I put my towels in the bin, the attendant said \"I'll do it, that's what I'm here for\". The virgin pina coladas and lava flows from the bar were excellent and creamy, and again, not an arm and a leg like at Wailea, Maui resorts. We ate all our meals at the Naupaka Terrace, which had great quality, lovely presentation, and good service at a reasonable price for a resort of this caliber. The nightly special was a good deal with a soup and salad bar, choice from three entrees and dessert for $25. I had the fresh fish each night, which was outstanding, and my dessert was one of the largest and best creme brulees topped with fresh fruit that I have ever had. The dessert alone at comparable resorts would cost up to $15. There is a nice walking path along the lagoon that passes the glassed in wedding chapel, condos under construction, and timeshare buildings. We took a 20 minute walk to the marina where snorkel trips and sunset cruises leave. On our sunset cruise we saw many spinner dolphins that entertained us. There is a general store at the Marina where there is a grill and you can get liquor, supplies, and snacks. At the Marriott time shares, there is also a general store for supplies, souvenirs, and alohawear. There are also a couple of restaurants there that were lower priced than the hotel if you want a change of scenery. There also seemed to be some nighttime entertainment as well, and a bit livelier atmosphere. The Ihilani is a very quiet resort, a good half hour away from the hubbub of Waikiki, so if you are looking for rest and relaxation, this is the place. It would have been nice if there had been a little combo band playing in the lobby as other resorts have, and perhaps shuffleboard and ping pong for some activity.

Pool is only 3 1/2 feet deep and small all the pool chairs are crammed together and its not romantic. no drinks on beach no coffee in rooms As usually they didn't give me a mini bar key no laundry bags atm is hidden in the basement they charge for calling the golf course ? and local calls of course. Lots of construction going on Charged me for parking even though I didn't have a car for stay but my girlfriend did. I think they add this too all bills even if you come in a cab! For the $400 starting price you can do a lot better elsewhere. The beach is nice and the golf course is good except for the greens are very slow.

We were not terribly impressed with the food. Unlike others, we werent impressed with the breakfast buffett. The food was cold and there were birds all around. Room service breakfast was much better, although pricey. We werent impressed with the sushi place either, maybe b/c we are spoiled and have good sushi restaurants at home.

Having 2 kids in the room with us, a king simply would not work. We were informed that if a king bed wouldn't work, we would have to find lodging elsewhere. Long story short, we went around and around with the manager and *miraculously* a double oceanfront room was available. My opinion is that they didn't want to give us a free upgrade, even though they screwed up... Then we got to the room.... it had a fabulous view, however, I would compare the decor / furniture to that of a cheap beach house. Sagging wicker sofa, dated looking beds and nightstands. Not what you would expect for a $350-$400 hotel room. The second night, our A/C went out, we were miserable and their solution was to send a tech to our room at 3:45 a.m. when we called.

The week before the trip to the island of Oahu, I read almost every review on the Ihilani and was aware of those both satisfied and dissatisfied. To those who left with ill feelings. I must only conclude, yours was a rarity. Our trip began with the ONLY disappointment. There unfortunately is NO free shuttle service to/from the airport. So after a 11 hour trek from New York to the Islands. It was somewhat frustrating to have a $75 tag for car fare from the airport to the hotel. Travel Tip: RENT A CAR ( Aside from the airport use, A trip from the hotel into Waikiki is $100 one way on a metered cab and more using transport service) Upon arriving the bellhop, Check In and general hospitality was both efficient and comforting. We were directed to the Gold plated elevators that would take us to an ocean view room on the 8th floor. Travel Tip: Join AAA Auto Club. The membership is $10 annually and the perk? The membership lowered the cost per night (6 nights) from 325.00 to 285. for the Deluxe Ocean View Room. Very, Very, Niceee. The room was located on south/west side and simply put was \"amazing\". The room with a sitting area, grand bathroom with separate tub and glassed shower, Hawaiian decor and a 25 foot long opening to an equaled terrace was captivating. The view below displayed the pool and its mosaic logo. The views ahead brought palm trees, lagoons and the Pacific Ocean. Travel Tip: We have included photos to bring our experience from our eyes to yours. Once Outside the hotel you are greeted with palm trees, hammocks, canopy chairs, tiki sun umbrellas, torch lit walkways and 4 individual lagoons. Travel Tip: To the right of the lagoons is a rock jetty that allows for perfect sunset viewing, snorkeling and a private beach area. careful as the jetty at certain points is quite rough. PS.

We rented a car for one day only, and this was enough. The beauty of the resort kept us occupied for the rest of the time.

The staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean and spacious. We were upgraded from a mountain to an ocean view room without asking. The only comment I have about the room is that the shower was clear glass so it prevented my niece & I, who were sharing a room, from using the sink & mirror while the other was showering. The restaurants at the resort were pricy, but so is everything in Hawaii, so we drove about 10 minutes to Kapolei where they have all sorts of fast food restaurants as well as Chili's & the Outback. We did eat at the breakfast buffet at the hotel twice and although it's $25, it carried us through lunch. If you're looking to do souvenir shopping, the Big K (KMart) in Kapolei is a great place to go! Lots of trinkets as well as coffee & chocolate covered macadamian nuts at cheap prices. We also bought water & snacks there rather than going to the hotel gift shop. I never had a problem getting a lounge chair at the beach and I'm not sure what people were talking about when they said the pool was small?? Just an aside, don't waste your money on the luau at Paradise Cove near the hotel. It was really cheesy and cost us $65 pp (and that was the cheapest price).

The Ko olina course was off limits due to an LPGA event and the other 2 courses the conciege set us up with were just OK. The kids loved the fish in the manmade ponds but the swimming lagoons although safe and beautiful were boring compared to natural waves and tide pools. The lagoon/ocean view rooms are large! We got adjoining rooms and it was a lot of space. The restaurant food was great for breakfast/dinner but overpriced. Even though we liked our food, we found ourselves not liking the restaurant, just not an upscale feel for the price. Also did the Paradise Cove luau, fun for the kids but not great compared to others we've been to. Another example of just ok is the outside furniture.

We got to the hotel and from the first moment, knew it would be special. They were getting ready for the Pro-Bowlers (the NFL rents the hotel out), so everything was sparkling clean and everyone was so helpful. We got an amazing room (Rm 315), it was so private, and HUGE, with a great lagoon view. I have never stayed in a place like this! Yes, it is pricey, but if you want a little splurge at the beginning or end of your Hawaiian vacation (like we did) and want to be away from the dump of Waikiki, this is the place. Yes, as other reviewers have said, it is about 30 mins from Honolulu (with no traffic). We were a little perturbed about there not being a single convenience store, other than 15 mins away, but we dealt with it. If you take the Barber's Point exit, there is a mall, with an Outback Steakhouse, KMart, Starbuck's, Jamba Juice, etc... We had the breakfast package at the hotel, which was great. The breakfast buffet otherwise was $24.99 pp!!!!! Yikes. I wouldn't buy it for that price, but if you can get it as part of your package, do it. There was everything you could think of...there is also complimentary coffee to get you going in the lobby which is also good. We ate at the japanese restaurant one night and had the buffet, which was soooo delicious; there was sushi, sashimi, teriyakis, noodles, and huge shrimp and vegetable tempura (among so many other things) , and the drinks were half price before 6:30 so we loaded up!! We also saw Tiki Barber at the restaurant, so that was cool, too!! :-) Valet and garage parking is $18 a day, which I thought was a little nuts, since you are in the middle of nowhere. I think you can park in the lot just before the entrance and not pay. You pay the $18 whether or not you valet it, so we just did the valet. We also used the mini bar in the room, and then realized the same things (sans alcohol) are available in the store on lower level, for about $2-4 dollars cheaper! So don't use your bar, load up on waters, etc. before you check in and just use the fridge (charges are not weight based, so you can load the fridge up). The beach and pools were nice, too. If you take the walkway to the end, then walk about 50 feet, there is a nice, little stretch of real beach that you can use if the waves aren't too big. The lagoon is nice, too, but if you wanted a little privacy, you could walk to this little beach. The snorkeling wasn't great in the lagoon, the water seemed cloudy, although we did see a nice turtle. The neighborhood is gated and secure, which is nice. You can take a walk at night and feel safe. It is a nice area, don't be disturbed at all the industrial plants you see on the way from the airport! (I was a little scared). All in all, we had a great time. We went to Pearl Harbor one day, GO EARLY!!!!! We got there at 8 am and still had to wait an hour to get in. After Pearl Harbor, we went to the swap meet at the Aloha Stadium (the valet has directions), and got a lot of our souvenirs. This was great! Just booths and booths all the way around the stadium with clothing, magnets, key rings, jewelry, fruits, towels, etc, etc, etc....well worth the stop in our opinions. Then we took a ride to Waikiki to experience it, and promptly turned around and drove back to the Marriott.

I agree with the comments about the lobby being bland, however, the espresso bar was a welcome addition to the distinctly average food on offer in the restaurants. You can at least get a decent coffee and a toasted bagel without taking out a second mortgage! The construction was the worst and most frustrating part of the stay. There is no way such extensive work should be conducted without guests being informed in advance. What's more, the staff were completely dishonest about the duration and extent of the work. We were told at check-in that the work would be completed the following day only for it to continue for the duration of our trip. The sounds of hammering and drilling don't feature in my vision of paradise. It was surreal to be sitting in such a beautiful position, overlooking the Pacific with workmen wandering past. We thought we had arrived at a Village People convention. The noise was unbearable at times. I would not return to the Ihilani and would strongly advise people to consider other options.

The pool is crowded, especially since a section of it was closed for construction while we were there. To make up for it, they gave us coupons for free shave ice at the \"Lagoon Lawn.\" But when we got there, the shave ice machine was shut down and remained so the entire time that we were there. Pretty lame. The Japanese restaurant was excellent. We tried the Monday night buffet, and the food was uniformly delicious. They had a ton of different types of dessert (somewhat unusual for a Japanese restaurant) and I enjoyed all of it. The gym is small and poorly designed. It's divided into two small rooms: a weight room, which was empty, and a cardio room, which was overcrowded. My wife and I stayed using our Marriott points, and they gave us a free upgrade to a deluxe, ocean-view room. The view was very nice (especially of the sunset), and the room was spacious.

I had read the reviews, seen pictures, and felt prepared for what to expect, but felt disappointed with the property none-the-less. There are some great things about the hotel, don't get me wrong, but I feel the property does not come close to other JW's we'ved stayed at, or the many other hotels we have visited in Hawaii. Overall, I think the property is unimpressive. I am used to the big grand lobby with views out to the ocean, comfy furniture, lush tropical flowers, ponds, etc. The lobby is stark and cold. Nothing impressive about it. Even though I had seen pictures of the pool area, I guess I was expecting more. It is small and crowded and not much fun. You can find the same or better at a condo. Again, NOTHING compared to the meandering pools, lagoons and fun water features of the many other 5 star Hawaiian hotels we've been. Also thought the poolside service was spotty. Some staff great and friendly, others cold and grumpy. We have two young children and thought the lagoons were great. Nice white sandy beaches with calm waters. Perfect for us. There is a really nice path to walk or jog along, but to get anywhere, you need a car. Our room was really nice, with a great ocean front view, but it was such a pain to have to call for ice! I read that in another review and didn't think much of it, but we called for ice everyday at least once (for which you have to wait and are expected to tip.) The food was a total disappointment. Very mediocre at best. We ate at Roy's several times which I think is the only good food option around. The above review does not even take into account the fact that they are doing construction on the hotel (shady portion of pool deck and hot tub closed for 3 days) which is still going on. CALL if you are going soon. The stone work was still being done on the pool deck when we left, as was the work over the lagoons and lobby area. MAJOR construction noise (hammering, pounding, drilling, etc.) which we could hear perfectly from our 10th floor lanai. ARRGH. Biggest issue with that was that we were not informed prior to our visit. But...that's another issue. So....I guess if you want to visit Oahu and avoid crowds, this might be the place for you.

Per the previous posters, the location of the hotel is definitely out of the way - it took us about 40 minutes to get to the hotel from Waikiki without any traffic. The rooms are serene and lovely. We had an ocean-view king on the 7th floor. The bed was extremely comfortable, the room was a decent size, and the bathroom was fabulous. A few issues we had included the very frustrating set up of the tv/closet/dresser - very annoying! The bathroom shower seal leaked at the bottom of the shower door, so there were large puddles of water on the floor. The lanai was large and very nice, and the lanai furniture was comfortable but stained. The pool was not huge and COLD - I assume it's not heated? Also, the hot tub was really dirty - sand and dirt on the side walls and in the water. Regarding the beach and lagoons, the sand on the beach was very rough (rocks) and quite dirty (lots of cigarette butts). But the lagoons/water themselves were calm and nice. And the sunsets from the hotel grounds are fabulous! We ate dinner one night at Naupaka Terrace and the food was good, not great, and we thought the prices were decent for a hotel. However, our waiter was quite pretentious and a male chauvinist. He called my husband by our last name (\"Mr. XXX\") yet did not refer to or talk to me at all, except when he took my order. He even called my husband \"Captain\" - weird. We are an attractive couple in our early 30's, and our waiter was in his early 30's as well, so who knows where any of his attitude came from. We did get room service for lunch on our last day, and the price was pretty outrageous...$6 for a can of diet coke! Our $55 order consisted of simply a burger, salad and two cokes. The food was fine but way too expensive for what we got. We did go to Roy's one night for dinner and it was wonderful, from the staff to the food. We highly recommend it! So here is our summary about the hotel. It's a very nice place to go if you are going just for the hotel (or to golf or spa, which we did not do), and not to walk around, see sights, tour, do activities, etc. It's quite a distance from Honolulu and I would not want to make that trek every day.

My two children ages 7 and 12 love the pool (though a little on the small side) and beach and there are always tons of kids around to make friends with. This hotel really is a great family hotel. Each morning we enjoyed the breakfast buffet (though costly). The resort area is gorgeous and the 4 lagoons make for a great beach front run. The staff at the beach rentals are helpful and friendly. I do have a couple of problems with the hotel. First of all, it seemed understaffed. It took over an hour and several phone calls to get house keeping to bring extra pillows to the room. Also, the turn down service was sporadic and every request took two phone calls. Second complaint, the food. As we did not rent a car, we were stuck within the resort for dining. The three restaurants on the property are pricey and frankly not that great. They lack variety and imagination. Given the remoteness of this resort, the restaurants always seemed to be unpleasantly crowded. The food at the pool is horrible. The hotel needs some more restaurants. We did dine at Roy's at the golf course twice which was good and we also ate over at the Ko Olina pool once which was actually better than the Ihilani.

My wife and I celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in Hawaii. First in Oahu at the JW Marriott and then in Maui, at the Marriott Wailea Resort (see separate rating). We took our children (ages 10 to 21) and we just wanted to relax\u2026and relax we did. The JW Marriott was extremely peaceful (we definitely chose a good time of the year to go (Dec. 16-24th)). The holiday decorations were absolutely gorgeous. Check-in was perfect (Stasia was extremely welcoming). We had already been upgraded to a garden view (did I want more? Sure, but this was fine). We had two rooms side by side and the way the doors worked were perfect (separate doors for each room, and then an outer set of doors for both of our rooms). Our rooms overlooked the gardens (and stingray pool). The staff was incredibly pleasant and professional no matter where we were or what we did. Dinner (the seafood buffet) was very expensive (we expected this based upon the reviews), but incredibly good. My boy and I ate at Roy's for lunch one day and were not nearly as impressed as the reviews led us to believe. We ordered up pizza one evening \u2013 exceptional and not a bank killer. Oh, and the free coffee in the morning was one of 'my' favorite things since I am more of an early riser in my family. We all had Spa treatments (except for my 10-year old), and man, what a treat. SO SO SO glad we decided to indulge hear at the JW rather than the Mandarin Spa at the Marriott Wailea in Maui. Again, the staff was amazing! At the end of our 4-day stay here I realized one thing\u2026We should've ended with the JW on our trip, as opposed to starting. The only negatives: Bathroom towels were nothing special, our room was on the 4th floor \u2013 right above the restaurant outdoor seating and heard the clatters of dishes throughout the evening, and the Lanai furniture was not that clean.

Positive: Big clean room with very good bed ans nice bathroom Very nice and helpful staff Nice swimming bay Very calm Negative: Pool too small Jacuzzi walls very greasy and dirty in the evening Parking too expensive, no possibility for free parking We had dinner in 3 restaurants in the Hotel Naupaka Terrace (medium quality) Ushio-Tei (Japanese buffet with good quality) Azul (very good quality but quite expensive) Outside we had dinner at Roy\u2019s (not very satisfied) Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak house in Honolulu (very good beef) We liked the hotel and we can recommend it in any sense.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "las vegas", "Title": "\u201crepeat traveler review\u201d", "Author": "frequenttraveler27", "ReviewID": "UR6471861", "Content": "Have stayed at this hotel many times over the past years. The hotel was pure paradise before Marriott took over (as mentioned in previous posts). The hotel now draws a different type of crowd vs. when it was privately owned. At this time the hotel attracts some conventions and families whereas before it was very upscale and private, not much noise, more of an adult resort. Much more traffic now with visitors also using the hotel ammenities from the time shares next door. As mentioned in many previous posts there is one main (small) pool and is always filled with little ones. For an adults only swimming experience one can walk over to the spa and fitness center where there is another larger pool but you do not have the ocean views. Overnight parking is $15.63 with tax and if you also have a breakfast buffet package there is another add on charge of approx. 2.63 per day that will show on the final hotel bill. So those were the negatives, now for the positives. The breakfast buffet is wonderful and one of the reasons we keep coming back to the Ihilani. Standard rates are $27 per person but as mentioned above one can include the buffet in a room package. Each morning there is an assortment of muffins, breads, waffles, pancakes or french toast. There are also potato/sausage selections as well as a small japanese breakfast with miso soup if desired. One can choose their own fresh fruits and make a smoothie. There is also another large regular fruit station with Hawaiian grown favorites such as mangos, papaya, pineapples, etc. All of the food venues are very good at the hotel. For lesser priced dinners one can drive to the town of Kapolei, about 5-7 minutes away where there is a Zippy's, Chili's, and cheaper restaurants. We love Zippy's! Kapolei also has movie theatres. We had an ocean view room facing the Paradise Cove luau side on the 6th floor. The views were beautiful, not just of the ocean but of the mountains too. There were lovely sounds of birds singing at sunrise and sunset. All of the staff is very friendly. A new feature we learned of since our previous stay is that the spa is now offering daily specials. They generally seem to be 15% off a specified treatment per day. Also there are now daily sales in the gift shops. In the business center internet usage is .50 per minute and the price to print is $1 per page. There is also a shipping service. There are covered canopy chairs at the beach for a fee and standard beach chairs that are free. Also there are a few covered huts, around 8 or so on the beach and grass. The lagoon is very swimable and generally very safe. As mentioned in previous posts driving time from the resort to Honolulu can be anywhere from 25 minutes to an hour depending on traffic. If you are looking for a getaway from the congestion of Waikiki this hotel is a good choice on the island. If you are looking for total quiet without interruption perhaps the Big Island would be better. When visiting this hotel don't forget to check out the sting rays and fish in the hotel's lagoons, there are scheduled feeding times during the day.

Okay honest opinions... The hotel is very nice, the staff is very friendly, and the concierge is the best. Our view from our room was a bit less impressive but that's okay. The room was very nice and i LOVED the huge bathroom. However, i hated the fact that there was no mini fridge to use. Yes they had a mini bar in the room... but there was a $25 charge to have them empty it out and for us to use it for our own personal use. That is a rip-off! I also hated the doors on the closet. It was a huge door that had 4 pieces to it that would slide back and forth. But if one side was open, the other side had to be closed. It was very hard to get into the closet, especially if my husband had his side open. It's hard to explain. It was just an annoyance for us. The pool was nothing special. It was a bit disappointing actually. It was just a huge circle pool. The Marriott beach club down the road had an awesome pool though. We absolutely LOVED the restaurant Azul's though (which is in the JW). It was so good!!! We also got the room service pizza... which was SO GOOD by the way. We got that a few times. very yummy! Bottom line... the hotel was okay for us. We loved that it was secluded from Waikiki. Waikiki for us was only about 20-30 minutes away and we went there often. One thing we didn't realize was that they charge you $15 a day for parking in their garage (you have no choice). I just wish i was told this when we checked in because we used valet every day thinking it was cheaper than paying for parking in their garage. We would have rather parked our car ourselves if we knew we were paying for the garage no matter what. I will say that it would be much nicer if there were a few surrounding hotels with other restaurant choices available. We definitely liked the hotel and we had a good experience.

It's a gorgeous place. We asked for an oceanview upgrade (as hubby is a platinum member). The room was spectacular, we swung the doors wide open and took a few pictures after we set the luggage down. Then . . . our neighbors w/ young kids stepped onto their lanai . . . kids screaming about the rays, look look look! There was absolutely NO WAY I was staying in a room where screaming-aged children could see into my room. A quick call to the desk scored us a jr. suite. Sweet! Can't say enough about he property, it really is flawless. The valet staff and Bell Captain are priceless. Lots of great help from Tommy, and he's pretty easy on the eyes. I referred to him as Hot Tommy when showing hubby all the places that he suggested on the North Shore. Every one was right on! Giovanni's shrimp truck, Sunset Beach & the Pipline and Ted's Bakery for choc/coconut cream pie! When checking out they loaded our luggage like puzzle pieces. They were great. Overall everyone there was pretty nice. We ate at the bar and the pool and the pool was better. We had a cooler of beer that we tapped into everynight while we sat on the lanai during/after sunsets. We were going to try the Saturday night seafood buffet, but it was loud, crowded and we saw people standing at the buffet w/ plates in their hands waiting for something to be refilled. Not our scene . . . which leads to the not so fabulous points. This place is in the middle nowhere. We took a drive north on Farrington and could not find anywhere to eat, just lots of homeless villages on the beach.

I basically plan my travel around the reviews on tripadvisor- so I am going to be as detailed as possible, but try to not repeat things I agree with on previous posts! Sorry for the length- but hope it helps! It was very easy to find from the Airport and after we rented a convertable at the airport (I would not do it any other way!) and it took us about 35 minutes to get to the hotel. We checked in and were given fresh towels to cool our hands (no leis to our dismay!). Our room was unbelievable! It is very large, with a couch, chair, coffee table and desk across from the bed. The decor is minimal which is great b/c of the view. There are large window/sliding glass door. Balcony is very roomy. You can either have shutters, screen, or shut the glass doors. Note the nitelite under the nightstands! A nice glow for late at night- the switches are next to you in bed on stand. The bed linens and comforter were AWESOME, but I think Marriott usually has softer beds, so I was surprised it was not as soft. Six pillows on the bed- so have your pick of hard, soft, or med! Plenty of places to unpack your clothes- and around 10 hangers. You also have robes and shoes. We paid for garden view upgrade and they \"upgraded\" us again for ocean view- which put us over the stingray pool with a partial view of ocean. But we could see the sunset easily which was great. Pool was okay- and unfortunately, it was 8-10 days after a full moon which is when jelly fish come, so lagoons were out for a few days (however people were in them and I did not see anyone get stung). If I could recommend going to the back of the pool area- by the lagoon, the chairs are turned to the lagoons so you get the breeze from the lagoons- but you can have your drinks! No drinking IN pool or down by lagoons. So this spot worked out well for us and no one else seemed to notice how perfect the seats were! They are VERY generous with their towels by the pool and we never had a problem getting any. A beautiful walk in the morning around the lagoons. There are cats and some kind of other animal, like gophers or something that make it even more interesting! Back to the room: water is the DOSS water and pretty expensive- I think $4. We made a trip to Sam's and got lots of bottled water and our own liquor. No one seemed to mind when we kept it in the fridge. We also kept lei's in the fridge the whole time. Now, on a common topic- ICE! I have to say, I have never been offered ice so much in my life. I had the opposite experience as most posters on here. Whenever our room was cleaned, someone came soon after to fill our ice, whenever we got room service, they offered a seperate bucket of ice with it. We never had to ask for it and like I said, we made alot of our own drinks in the room. Great service! Now on service: EXCELLENT!!!!!!!! The front desk was always available and friendly, the cleaning service was amazing and we hardly ever saw them! The concierge was helpful and had a lot of real advice. The wait staff was hit or miss. It seemed to take a LONG time to get a drink no matter where we went. I'll go more into restaurants. First I have to talk about the valet- they were the best valet ever! VERY friendly and like said before- they know the island better than anyone- even concierge. They also give towels out as you are on your way out in case you need them which was a nice bonus! They even always had our top down on our car for us! Naupaka- first night we had Damian as a waiter and he was the best we have ever had. I ordered all of his recommendations and was more than pleased. The second night we ate here- the wait staff was not as helpful and food and drinks took a long time. We got Mike at the end to replace who we had and he made up for the bad service and bad food we had rec'd (we DO NOT recommend the seafood platter for two- shrimp, tuna, oyesters, and crab, it had no taste) But the OPA specialty was great as well as the corn chowder. Mike got us a free piece of pie for our anniversary. The breakfast buffet is GREAT!!!! A bit pricey at $26 pp, but VERY VERY good! We walked down to the sister hotel and paid $16pp, it was a decent buffet, but not as good as Ihilani's. You can also get a sweet breakfast or ham and cheese croissent with your free coffee in the morning (of course the food and latte's aren't free). Azul- pretty much same food as Naupaka, but fancier, better service, more pricey and you can get a great view. More steaks. We did see the management correcting the hostess in front of us which seemed a bit unprofessional. Hokulea Lounge- we only went twice and were not impressed. Took a long time to get a drink and no view. It was okay. Pool bar- better than most pool bars as far as food. we had drinks there the day of the earthquake and I don't think the bartender was too happy he had to work. The waitresses were very nice. Recommend the pork sandwich and a sandwich that was like a cuban but better! They made all this w/o electricity (earthquake day) and it was just as good! Still wish we could have drinks in pool and lagoons, but oh well. As far as the earthquake- I think it was handled very well. It was our first earthquake and we ran downstairs. The friendly face at the front desk said it was a \"tremor\" when a man behind us laughed and said it was no tremor, but everyone remained calm. The electricity was out, yet they kept Naupaka and pool bar opened and made what they could. They made an announcement when we could expect electricity back on and they were right on. After hearing some nightmare stories from WAikiki, I was glad they handled it so well. I did not give it an excellent, b/c I have to admit my husband and I got BORED! It is pretty far from things and the bar is not \"fun\". No dancing or anything. We ended up leaving early and heading for Waikiki for some night fun and more daily activities. The first few days were nice for relaxing but we can only relax so much. So if you are looking for a relaxing vacation, this is the place! If you want a little more excitement and not into routine as much, you may want to try Waikiki. As for myself, I think a few days at KoOlina and then a few at Waikiki would be perfect!

I have no idea why anyone would complain about the rooms being small. They are very generous as well as clean and comfortable. The bathroom was gorgeous and we felt like we were living in the lap of luxury, what with the spa robes and slippers provided and the spectacular views from our lanai. I recommend requesting a ''sunset view'' if possible. There is construction taking place off the other side of the hotel, and three huge cranes are visible. Every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful. The concierge gave excellent directions to any of the sights on Oahu. The parking attendants provided fresh towels and bottled water and were also very willing to offer island info. I would HIGHLY recommend purchasing the breakfast package. The buffet every morning was awesome - - with a wonderful and delicious variety of fruit, waffles, omelets, eggs, etc. A person could live off of it until dinnertime, which is what we usually did! The restaurants at the hotel are expensive, but driving to Kapolei is no big deal .. and there are many options there. The only drawback might be the location. The hotel itself is in an upscale environment .. but just up the coast are miles of beaches inhabited by homeless people living in tents. Don't be tempted to turn left on the highway to explore, you'll regret it! And to the other side of the hotel (heading towards Kapolei) is Barber's Point, which is a big industrial park.

The hotel itself is very nice, well appointed, and in an excellent location. The on-site lagoons are great for swimming or snorkling, and there is plenty of space and available lounges to lay out and relax. At some resorts, I've had to get up early to stake out a spot and a chair - not this one. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.

Negatives: Slight extra cost for a refrigerator in the room - didn't deliver it until two days after we requested it - after a second request, and then tried to bill us for it for all of the days. Mistakes happen. When brought to their attention, they apologized and didn't hesitate to remove the charges from our bill. Cost of food at the hotel - hey it's Hawaii - what do you expect? ALL hotels have expensive food. We got the refrigerator and got some snacks at the Safeway in Kapolei - a 5 minute drive from the hotel. Other food in Kapolei: Outback, Chili's, McDonalds, Quizno's, Jack in the Box, Burger King, etc. Plenty of cheaper food options close by - just not in walking distance. Traffic driving into the city - worth the trade off in my opinion. Figure an hour in the morning to get to waikiki, and about a half hour to get to Pearl Harbor during traffic time. Hey, it's vacation - who's in a rush? Overall, I looked at a lot of other hotels while we were there. I didn't see any that made me wish I had stayed there instead. The best place in Oahu for me.

This is a spectacular property with wonderful service. I specifically booked this property to avoid the congestion of the Waikiki area, and anyone who relishes the feeling of seclusion will appreciate it. This resort is a twenty minute drive west from the Honolulu airport, which is approximately forty-five minutes from Waikiki. The resort is nestled within the gated Ko'Olina resort community. When we pulled up to the resort, we were greated by the valet who said \"we'll take care of everything.\" After an effortless check-in, we received a call from the bell desk asking if we were ready for our luggage. This was an excellent start to a great stay at the Ihilani. We booked an ocean-view room with the breakfast package. (More on the breakfast later). Our immaculate and spacious room (4th floor) overlooked the pool and one of the Ko'Olina lagoons. It was magical. I travel a lot for business, but this trip was our anniversiary and the Ihilani did not dissapoint. The room...is very nice with a separate seating area, a large balcony, and a huge bathroom with his/hers sinks and tub and a separate shower. There is a fully-stocked mini-bar, but beware as there are many goodies which carry a hefty fee. You will have to figure out all the other great features of the rooms when you get there! Dining - The Ihilani has a magnificient Japanese restaurant called \"Ushio Tei,\" which served a fabulous buffet on our first night. The selections were numerous and fresh, including out-of-this-world creme brule. Again, for more detail...go there!!! We wish we could again, and again. They also have the absolute, without a doubt, best breakfast buffet...ever. (There is a scale in your room, which I recommend that you don't pay any attention to while you are there). They have smoked salmon, eggs, fresh fruit, omlettes, etc. (I promise...I don't work for the Ihilani!). The grounds are immaculate, and just the right size. They have a shark and fish pond as well as a pond with manta rays. Note...Manta Rays are not dangerous and we are troubled to hear that people are attacking these poor creates in the wake of Steve Erwin's death since our stay conincided with that tragedy. The Rays at this resort are tame and quite used to the presence of people. We spent most of our three days on activities around Oahu including swimming with dolphins, skydiving, soaking up North Shore sun, etc. We wish we spent more time at this resort and the great lagoons, but get out and explore the wonders of O'ahu. The biggest mistake I hear people make is that they didn't think that there is much to do on O'ahu and they don't allow themselves enough time here. We had read other reviewers complain about the size of the pool, but it was fine as there are huge lagoons to go swim in, as well. I really don't have anything to complain about regarding the Ihilani. We were disappointed in the Turtle Bay, but all was right at the Ihilani. This resort is on the leeward, or dry, side of the island. The surrounding mountains are very brown and not much to look at in late-August / early September. So if you came all the way here to save money on a mountain view room, you may want to cough up the extra money to get an ocean view.

This Hotel is spectacular with great service. We were upgraded to a suite that was fantastic. Call before your trip to request a room on a high floor with a view. Worst rooms are any that face the spa or carport entrance side. There is no coffee in the rooms although they do have a station from 6am to 10am in the lobby that offers complimentary coffee. Nice, large rooms well appointed and very clean. We really liked the remote control for the lights and ceiling fans. Did not like having to order ice, rather than walking to an ice machine. Bathroom was well appointed with giant tub and separate shower. Sign up for the Marine Life Program at the hotel. You can feed the sharks and rays in the hotel's ocean ponds that are ironically adjacent to the pool. It's totally safe and the kids will really enjoy this experience. Spa - Nice selection and okay fitness center...a bit small, but good machines and free weights. Food - Typical hotel food is the norm at the JW Marriott, just more expensive. Room service was okay if you have kids, but always skip the Poolside Grill - food is worse than McDonalds. Take a short walk over to Roy's if you want to stay close to the propery or walk over to the Marriott Ko Olina Time Share for breakfast buffet at $12. Visit Sam Choy's in Honolulu, especially if you have kids. Pool - Very small. Go to the beach instead, you're in a tropical paradise. No worries about getting chairs at the lagoons and never too crowded. Some advice for your stay: Rent a car; it's worth it. Stop by one of the K-Mart stores on the way from Honolulu (exit 7 off H1). There's an area in nearby Kapolei with restaurants and you can check your room phone book for coupons, which will yield a lot of deals at local eateries (not in the resort). Jurison's for breakfast, now that's good! sorta like a i-hop or Denny's but way better! Visit Pearl Harbor - Go early in the morning, around 7:00 am. Visit the USS Arizona first, then tour the USS Missouri. Opens at 7:30am. If you get there after 10am the lines can get long and you may spend 1-2 hours in line. Battleship USS Missouri and Submarine USS Bowfin are in the same area. These are about $15 each so you can go or skip them. Look for coupons in brochures for two for one. You can take pictures of them from Arizona Visitors Center and the Arizona tour ferry. Go on the lawn behind the Visitor's Center. You can also walk around the Bowfin Memorial area for free without taking the tour. Its worth the time. Visit the Swap Meet on weekends and Wed. It's only a couple blocks from here at Aloha Stadium, so it is perfect for visiting after seeing Pearl Harbor. Well worth it if you want to save $$$ on gifts. Hanama Bay - O'ahu's most famous snorkeling destination!!! Go early since it's on the other side of the island and it gets crowded. A reminder: The beach park is closed on Tuesdays. If you visit this side of the island, hike to the top of Diamond Head Crater -- The entire family can make this easy 1.4-mile round-trip walk to the top of the 750-foot volcanic cone with its rewarding view of Oahu.

The weather was perfect and the accomodations were really great. We have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the country, and the JW was wonderful. Before I begin, I must say the JW in Cancun is my favorite spot by far. The best hotel there. We were so impressed with the Cancun hotel, we had no reservation booking here. My children range in age from 18 to 5, and we were all pleased with everything the hotel had to offer. The rooms are very large. Huge bathrooms and balconies. We spent a lot of time reading and enjoying a wedding below us on the balcony. We were upgraded to an ocean view, but we could see everything happening around the eel pools and gazebo, plus a view of the ocean. We had adjoining rooms which were attached by a main double door which opened up to two individual doors. We were able to get from room to room very easily. Long entry ways into the rooms and like I said huge, marble and travertine tiled bathrooms. Make sure you do the buffet in the morning. A great way to get started. We would eat sort of late, fill up on good quality and well prepared breakfast items, then just eat dinner in the evening. We were able to eliminate lunch all 6 days this way. The breakfast was included in our room rate-a great thing. The fresh squeezed juice was amazing. Try the dragonfruit too. On the north shore hit Matsumotos for great shaved ice and a t shirt. There may be a wait, but it goes fast. Proceed up the north shore and visit turtle beach. A small beach where the turtles come right up to you. My kids had a very close encounter with 2 amazing turtles. We picked the moss off the rocks and hand fed them. There's a white picket fence across the street, and you will most likely see others parked and walking across the highway to thebeach. Visit the Mormon Temple. Beautiful. There is a great little local restaurant right by the temple called the Hukelau (I know I spelled that wrong) right in the middle of a residential area. Closed on Sunday and Monday. The other direction, visit Pearl Harbor. Go early! Also the swap meet is a GREAT place to get local stuff CHEAP. Get all your souveneirs here, for sure. Great prices on unusual beads, t shirts and local Hawaiian gear. Open Wednesdays and weekends. We went twice. All in all the hotel was wonderful. Just get up a little early and go get your loungers. Enjoy the morning with a free cup of coffee. It is absolutely beautiful at 6am by the pool. No one is there, and it's quiet.

We stayed in Maui at the Ritz Carlton in Kapalua the last time we were in Hawaii and were pretty sure no other resort could top the Ritz. We were happy to be proven wrong at the Ihilani. Not only are they an exquisite immaculate hotel, they do these little things that just put them head and shoulders above all. For example: -- in the afternoon, they deliver ice to your room. I know this doesn't sound like much, but the Ihilani does not have ice vending machines so having ice is a big deal. I think this is a great service. -- at the pool, they come around offering ice cold face towels with a touch of refreshing essential oils. There is nothing like being offered an ice cold towel when you're out in the sun. -- if you rent a cabana (only $35 for 1/2 day) they bring out a cooler for you with some fruit and ice and bottled water. -- the valet guys know the island like the back of their hands. They will always ask if you need directions somewhere and they give you the best routes to where you want to go. They have copies of the island's map and they will whip one out and mark it up clearly so you don't get lost! It's all about the little things because the big stuff, which they excel at, is what you would expect in a resort of this caliber. The pool is small, that's what everyone says about it, but seriously, you need maybe 10 minutes in that pool before you're \"done\" with it because right around the corner is the most incredible lagoon you will see! After taking your first dip in the lagoon, you're not going to be interested in the pool! If you want to use the pool for laps, you're much better off swimming in the lap pool on the fitness lanai at the spa -- which I believe is complimentary to all hotel guests along with the gym there. There is a fee to use the tennis courts ($22) but they have a choice of a hard court or a sand-filled synthetic grass court. They bring out iced water and tennis balls, too. We brought our own rackets, but they have rackets for you to borrow as well. Great service, great amenities and a wonderful place to relax. Expect to pay resort prices at their restaurants, but the japanese buffet at Ushio Tei is NOT to be missed -- totally worth it for $39. Lastly, I totally agree with the last reviewer's suggestion to have a Lava Flow.

The hotel and property were in great condition and the service was impeccable. The pool at first looked small but seemed to accomodate all of the guests who wanted to swim. Yes, there is limited area for lounge chairs shaded from the sun, but when we could not find one we walked down to the beach and lawn area and pulled up a lounge chair there. No problem. Here are a few tips that may help: -Yes, rent a car. Traffic can be a pain at rush hour but there is so much to see on the island. Concierge has great directions to the restaurants they recommend as well as other excursions. If you choose to rent a car on the property and not at the airport (there is a Hertz desk on site), call the concierge before your trip and they will set up a car service pick -up for you. It is $70 and much better than getting a cab - the Marriott does not have a shuttle. -Yes, the resort restaurants are expensive and so are the drinks. However, if you like sushi, the Japanese restaurant has 1/2 price rolls and sushi, as well as 1/2 price drinks such as frozen drinks or martinis from 5:30 to 6:30 for dine-in. There is at least one buffet most nights in the resort and they are all $39 for adults, $19 (I think) for up to 12 and 4 and under free. Again, if you like Japanese, the Japanese buffet is worth looking at. Children's meals are a whopping $8, so definitely choose the buffet for your child 4 and under. -There is a walking/running path along the 4 lagoons that is 3 miles round trip. Try to wake up early at least one morning and take a walk on that path. Hawaii is just as beautiful in the morning as it is in the evening. Wow, what a sight. -The pool area has entertainment every night and on the weekends they have hula dancers. Great for the kids. -Try the drink called the Lava Flow while you're there - no other place can make it like Hawaii can. -Complimentary Kona coffee until 11:00 am daily. It is so good.

We have stayed at the Halekulani and the Kahala Resort when it was still with Mandarin Oriental. These were 5 star hotels. Very classy, with history and great service. The JW Marriott is on a similar level with the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki, just not as big. The best thing that it has going for it is the location. It is away from the Waikiki area and has its own beach/lagoon, this is a great advantage. The Halekulani has just a sliver of beach left in front of it, but the pool is nice. The JW Marriott has a limited choice for food and everything is relatively pricey. Azul was very nice but if I had a choice between Azul and restaurants similarly priced in Honolulu, like Alan Wongs, Chef Mavro, Michel's, etc., I would not choose Azul. Service was fine, no complaints there, everyone always had a smile.

Well, we got up graded to a deluxe ocean view room. We had a great view of the pool and beach/lagoon area, but we also got a view of the industrial park. But this did not bother us as much as we thought. Also as we have a 9 year old son, our dinner schedule starts around 6 to 6:30, which means we completely miss the sunset, so I guess it worked out well for us.

Additionally, if you find yourself stuck staying at the Ihilani, bring the manager with you to the room to inventory the mini-bar. The staff either does not restock the mini-bar between guests, or takes things during your stay. The result of this criminal activity was a charge of $73 on my credit card after I returned home.

First off, we LOVED this place. Secondly, we have twin 6 year olds and were traveling with my sister who has a 22 month old. So we found it GREAT for families with younger children. That said, you should know that there are a LOT of kids at this place and if YOU have kids, that makes it good. If you do not, you may still like this resort (it is VERY nice for a time share). Third: This is a time share resort, obviously researched, planned and built by a company that knows what people want in time shares. I generally do not like time shares as they usually do not have the following, but this one does! - valet - self parking (with a fee) - bell hops - concierge - Ritz level accomodations (seriously!) - huge, fluffy beds and pillows - pool side service for drinks and food Like many timeshares, they also have: - activities for the kids (games, crafts) - huge pools - several jacuzzis (some adult only, which is nice) - beautiful gym with sauna, steam room, showers (VERY nice) - cheezy events to get to know thier vendors (tours, taxis) This is seriously the nicest time share resort I have ever been too, and (unfortunately, in most cases) that has been a lot. I've found they usually don't have hotel ammenities that I really like - (bell service, essential when you are trying to corral several kids and your husband is going to park the car). Also, many time shares look run down and the jacuzzi is mildewy, etc. This one is not like that at all, at least as of July 2006. With all this said, here are a few tips and tricks to make your stay at Ko Olina better. If you get the chance to go here, I would DEFINATLEY go!! (Caveat: other reviews have done a good job telling you restaurants, that you need a car (this is a bit remote), etc. - so I'm trying to write stuff you won't find on other posts). Tips: - They will give you free, beautiful leis here upon your first visit to the concierge - so save yourself $12 at the airport and get one free here. - They have 2 free events where you can meet their vendors, get free mai tais, free coffee (the morning event) and they have drawings and stuff. We didn't go to either one, as they were very crowded (popular), but you could do so and learn a lot and get free drinks. - You don't HAVE to have a car if you plan to stay mostly on property - as they have LEO's transportation and plenty of tours to things like Pearl Harbor. Plus if you drive yourself you have to pay parking each day ($7 self, $9 valet). Next time,we will probably save our $400 and not rent a car. You can walk to Roys and the Ilihana. You can take local transport to Sav On and still be ahead several hundred dollars. - Pearl Harbor requires tickets, that are free -- but you gotta show up in person early that morning. We tried and didn't get tickets (we showed up at 10:30 am -- too late) - so next time we will do a tour anyway, and they make sure you get in. Special Fun Things for Kids - The \"kiddie\" pools are GREAT for kids! One has a \"real\" beach entry pool with real sand. Its only about 18\" deep and ALL the little kids had a ball. SPECIAL TIPS: I would STILL put my kid in one of those floaty suits, as they can get into the bigger part of the pool. There are no life guards. I saw several little ones go too close to the bigger pool for my comfort level, especially when you knew their parents were drinking Mai Tais or reading a book... - The \"real beach\" pool has pretty \"gritty\" sand (large grains) so I would also put my kids in water socks or those pool shoes. These are great for the beaches and snorkeling too - as there always seems to be coral around. Invest in them. - The other pool also has HUGE \"Baja shelves\" - only a few inches deep to 2' deep. So there is a LOT of room for the little ones to play - as well as deep areas for adults and older kids. But its unusual to find so much for the toddler set. It was nice. - Next to the beach pool is a little play structure (slide, climby thing) also fun for the little ones. - The resort offers a LOT of fun activities for the kids - crafts, temporary tatoos, shaved ice ($3), video games, group games like tag, marco-polo, bubbles and more. We often just sat on our butts and watched the resort staff play on the big lawns with our kids (and about 30 others). It was VERY nice as a parent! Some are free, others require a small fee. - If you go on the time share offer, they do have a nice child care area for kids over 3. Video games, sodas, cookies, crafts, etc. Our kids didn't want to leave. Tricks - Their is fish feeding done at the 1st bay each morning. If you show up at 7:30 the guy will give you a fish finder (lamenated card) and you can identify several who literally fly out of the water to eat the fish food. - Bring your snorkel gear and you can watch this fun event from below the surface! - If you get a spa visit at the Ilhiania spa you can charge it back to your villa and get 10x Marriott miles. The spa was awesome. - The 4th lagoon is heavily visited by locals and my kids had fun playing with \"real Hawaiian\" children (which were actually from all over the USA, due to the military bases there). Very fun. - You can rent kayaks, snorkels, water trampoleens and a paddle boat (called a baracudda) at the 1st and 3rd lagoon and charge them to your room. The rates seemed very reasonable to us (like $10 or $15 per hour). - If you have to check out early in the day, but your flight is later, they will give you lockers in the timeshare spa. We stayed all day and played, took showers at five, drove to Waikiki and ate dinner and still made our 9:45 pm flight out. It is a wonderful benefit to be able to use the showers after all day. Hope you go!

We found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful, showing us the way to little breakfast spots (We liked the Hapa Grill in nearby shopping center) and directing us to cheap spots for gear like Safeway and Kmart. During the mornings, we enjoyed the bran muffins and lattes at the espresso bar, which serves very good FREE coffee every morning. I'm a sushi fan and very picky about what I eat, and I very much enjoyed the sushi bar on the premises. Go there during their happy hour and it's half off! A great value for very fresh fish. They made up fresh ahi steaks for the kids, even though it wasn't on the kids menu. The only bad thing was they wouldn't make my favorite spicy scallop hand rolls; not sure why but they said they couldn't do it. The poolside bar was expensive, but of good quality. The fish burgers were exceptional, with really yummy homemade tartar sauce. The mai tais were excellent! We usually ate at the Napuaka Terrace, where I really enjoyed the grilled vegetable wrap with cilantro hummus. So good, and so healthy!!! The only bad experience we at Naupaka Terrace for dinner. There was a bone chip in my husband's filet, and the avocado in the mango spring rolls was totally rubbery and not ripe. I think they were going through some kitchen changes, as we saw a culinary applicant being interviewed at the coffee shop that morning. We quiety told the manager and he fixed the problem straight away by taking those items off our bill. The Ihilani Iced Tea, made with a special blend of passion fruit juices and Pekoe tea, is stellar and a must-try. Gourmet magazine has featured the recipe in a past issue. The poster who complained there were no refills doesn't realize that this is a signature drink that takes some trouble to make and is not simply made of tea bags and water. I do agree about the ice situation; it was never filled daily as it was supposed to. And yes, they did expect a tip for bringing it up. It was annoying. But still, it was easier to tip for free ice than to head over to Safeway every day and pay for it. Perhaps they are trying to save water?? The lagoons are perfect for families, where there are fish, sea turtles, jumping crabs and other little critters. Our children loved the pool and swam in it every day. It's only about 3 feet deep at the center and was always a good temperature. The spa was on the cooler side, but after mentioning something, they heated it up the next day. I had a spa treatment during our stay, which was a therapeutic massage and absolutely wonderful! There is a roman bath and nice sitting area. Not as lavish or big as other spas I've been to, but I still enjoyed it very much. Roy's was absolutely wonderful and we ate there three times. Ask for Suzi, one of the best servers and friendliest women we've ever met. She was so attentive and wonderful. The seared ahi was great, as was the macadamic crusted fish. We also ordered the appetizer boat, scrumptious! They are very kid-friendly with a whole menu for children that starts out with quesadillas followed by veggies and dip, main course and yummy homemade cookie ice cream sandwiches for dessert. A great value for kids and a great menu for mom and dad! In all, I highly recommend this resort. I liked that it was away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.

For luxury Hawaii, it was average, but on the whole it was good. The room for 4 was average sized. The best part was the large balcony with a table, chairs and lounge. With 4 people crowded into one room, the balcony was a welcome respite. We could also watch the nightly entertainment at the pool from our balcony. My biggest complaint is that nothing other than 2 double beds were available. \"Double\" is a misnomer. It is difficult for 2 average sized adults to sleep comfortably in a double bed. If you regularly sleep on a queen or king bed, you will have trouble trying to squeeze in to a double bed. The view was amazing. We had an ocean view room, directly facing the lagoon. Perfect. The pool area is small, as many have remarked. It is also kids, kids, kids. From prior reports we were aware of this (which is one of the reasons we selected this resort for a trip with our kids). But if you are a couple looking for a quiet romantic time, I would suggest elsewhere. The pool is round, so kids were everywhere. There is no \"shallow end\" or \"kids end\" which could provide some corner for adults. In our opinion, the finest part of this resort is the lagoon. Well manicured, lots of loungers. No waves. Just wonderful clean, warm sea water. It remains shallow well into the water, so the kids had lots of room to play. Our kids ran in and out of the water all day. Be advised: There is no bar service and no alcohol is allowed on the lagoon beach. We like the pampering of bar service, so that was an issue for us, albeit not a major one. The cost of everything is off the charts. While Hawaii is expensive as a whole, the cost of food at this resort is outrageous. Unfortunatley, this resort is well off the beaten path, so the food options are quite limited. Be prepared to drop a bundle on food. We had our kids in the kid's club one morning. It is nothing other than glorified babysitting. Not worth the investment unless you are desperate for some adult alone time. Certainly this place is nice, hence my 4 star opinion. But it is expensive, and with such expense comes expectations. That's where the resort fell a little short. All in all, a nice place.

My husband and I stayed in the JW Ilihani Marriott last week for 10 days. First if all, the fact that we had to ASK for ice each time from housekeeping was very inconvenient and were expected to tip the person that brought the ice to the room. RIDICULOUS. We just didn't tip because of principle. Talking to other guests we realized that many guests were annoyed with the ice situation. We were supposed to get ice each day with the room service but found that ice was not even given to us although they said they would. Just poor service and hospitality. In addition, the valet parking department were annoyingly phony with the guests and ofetn would team up to unload our bags which we then had to tip both guys and found that to be simple robbery. We didn't tip both guys just one and that they were upset but we didn't care. Anyway, the ONLY worhty restaurant was AZUL-excellent. The breakfast buffet was mediocre at best. The Japanese restaurant was always empty.....tells you a lot about that establishment. The concierge make mistakes. Be careful. Check your bill daily. Watch out for extra charges. The time share representative was very rude to us. Pushy and rude. Don't waste your time going to the 90 minute tour. WASTE OF TIME. The reception area/check-in staff was unfriendly and were not able to answer questions regarding Marriott Rewards. Come on...no one can answer our questions? Those guys need to do their homework. Our advice is avoid the poolside bar. Overpriced for sure and below average food. The hamburgers were cold and disgusting. We refused to pay for them and sent them back. There are great places to eat on the island and nearby the hotel. Roy's was fabulous and worth every penny. Outback Steakhouse was a 3 minute drive and well worth it. Buying cold cuts and fresh bread from Safeway nearby was worth it. Make your own sandwiches and eat them on the beach. AVOID the poolside bar.THe lagoons at Ko Olina are fun. Nice concept. Very appropriate for kids. Overall, the hotel is not a good representation of a JW calibur hotel. It's average and expensive. You are far from Waikiki. Traffic is always bad. Gas is expensive. Better to stay in Waikiki since the Marriott Ilihani is not all it's cracked up to be. We share this opinion with other fellow travellers.

We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and my parents came with us to celebrate their 50th wedding Anniversary. The Ihilani Resort sent to each room a chilled bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries and hand written greetings. The lovely rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are like mini spas. Our room (1218) had a magnificent view and large lana'i. The sunsets were beautiful, on the last night we ordered room service and had private dining on the lana'i. The pool is clean and the pool lounge chairs all have padded cushions. We all enjoyed the pool bar/grill, the strawberry coladas are the best! Even the pool area bathroom is clean and decorated well. The lagoons are truly lagoons. They are for swimming and calm water activities. There are no waves, just in case you thought surfing was on your list. You will have to go north for that. The walking path ( 3 miles round trip ) through the complex was a fun walk and you pass by all of the lagoons. Our 10 year old daughter enjoyed a day at the kids club and made some crafts to bring home. We did rent a car and spent a full day seeing the sights. The Dole Pineapple farm has great pineapple muffins. The ease and comfort of the Ihilani made for a very relaxing time together. The restaurant staff was always cheerful and greeted us by name.

Originally, the plan was to explore the island of Oahu, and save our beach relaxation days for Maui. However, upon reaching the JW, we could not bring ourselves to move. The lagoons are a great idea. They are so calm, it is possible to swim from one shore to the other, and, if it wasn't for the terrific snorkeling, you might think that it was a pool. Speaking of which, I have three kids in my family, all of whom were apprehensive about the conspicuous lack of pool at the hotel. Trust me: the pool looks small, but, even at full occupancy, it is never crowded, and perfectly adequate. Even the restaurants here are decent: Ushio Tei has great sushi, and the Napauka Terrace is diverse in menu and taste. I steered clear of Azul: it looked too sterotypically overrated and overpriced, and I did not enjoy Roy's quite as much as everyone on this site. Other than the hotel restaurants and Roy's, there are not many places to eat here, though the drive to Waikiki is manageable for a dinner. When I drove into Honolulu, and saw just how tacky it had become, I was pleased with my choice, and remain so. The JW is quiet and relaxing on an island that is anything but. Its service is not quite up to the level of a Four Seasons or a Ritz, but its facilities definitley are. In conclusion, a perfect place to spend a week or less. PS: rooms are great.

We have stayed in many of the top hotels on the islands and found the JW Marriott to be very enjoyable and relaxing. The grounds are just beautiful with walking trails along the 4 lagoons and plenty of room to spread out and not feel crowded by other travelers. The pool is small - and the pool attendants could be more agressive about clearing up deserted towels so that more seats around the pool could be available. But all in all the pool was very enjoyable. We swam a little during the day - but mostly swam in the evenings after dinner. Not many people in the pool at that hour and the pool is open until 10pm. The lagoon was pretty and very calm for swimming and wading. What we liked was that there were always plenty of lounge chairs that could be moved around on the sand or the grass surrounding the lagoon. Our delux King room on the 4th floor was beautiful. Very spacious with a large deck that was extremely private. We looked at the water side away from the lagoon and loved out view. Nice furniture on the decks also. The bathroom was wonderful and very large. The bedding was terrific. We could not have been happier with the room in general. The open air restaurant by the pool was good. We had a buffet breakfast with our room and enjoyed it each morning. We also had lunch there twice and found the food good and the service very nice. We also ate at Azul - and found the service to be perfect... but the food a little lacking. But they were so nice that I cannot fault the place at all. When they noticed that my son did not eat much of his dinner they presented him with a free dessert to make up for his dinner. It was a very pleasant surpise. The drive to downtown Honolulu and to Pearl Harbor could not have been more than 20 minutes. We did not find a traffic problem at all. I would not let the distance of this hotel from Waikiki to be a deterant. We liked being away from the crowds... but I don't think I would stay there for more than 3-4 days.

The staff told us that once we stayed in the suite, we would never want to leave...they were'n't kidding! It was the absolute nicest, most luxurious room I've ever stayed in. It had two very large lanais, one overlooking the more quiet part of the beach and the other with a view of the green mountains. It had a huge marble bathroom with a jacuzzi, a sitting area with a nice furniture and a desk and a very large bedroom with a very comfortable king bed. The whole place was stunning. It was very generous of the staff to upgrade us and give us this experience. The second time I stayed, I made my reservation late and could only get a mountain view room. Once I arrived, I asked for an ocean view and they were more than accommodating, considering I didn't have a reservation for one. They gave me a wonderful room with 2 beds and a very large lanai overlooking the lagoons. It had the same beautiful marble and elegant features throughout. The rooms are extremely spacious, light, airy, clean and modern. I love their beautiful, large bathrooms. The linens on the bed and in the bathroom are really soft, new and comfortable. We ate at all of the restaurants there during our stay. The food served by the poolside is very good and great for a casual lunch. The brunches are delicious, whether you choose the buffet (excellent spread) or choose a single menu item. Their signature restaurant is also very good. They make very fruity, great cocktails and drinks. I had a massage in their spa, which is also wonderful and worth making a reservation at. My friends and I went swimming in the lagoon at 2 a.m., and no one ever bothered us. That's one of the special things about Ko Olina...you can stroll on the beach at all hours and have so much space around you. It's never too crowded and it feels like you have the whole beach to enjoy to yourself. While it is a 45 minute drive, it's well worth it if you want to get away from overcrowded Waikkiki. I recommend that you rent a car, just to get you to and from the airport and any where else if you desire. I never had problems with traffic like the previous reviewer mentioned, and we drove at all times of the day, weekday and weekends. He also mentioned a refinery nearby...you can see it in the distance to the south, but you can choose to focus on this one thing far away or choose to revel in the beauty of what's close at hand in the midst of the property. Ko Olina and Turtle Bay Resort are my two most favorite hotels on Oahu...Ko Olina is more upscale and Turtle Bay, while very nice, is more casual. They both share in common seclusion, privacy, quietness, and being gorgeous properties right on the beach without any other hotels close by.

Sorry for the long review, but I want to be thorough. Here's the blow-by-blow: (1) Hotel is located in the (gated)Ko Olina area. You need to go through \"security\" each time you enter the area by car. I guess they want to weed out the hoodlums :-) (2) Hotel entrance, while nice, very bland. We actually drove past it. Once you drive down the alley way, you come across the main entrance. The hotel charges $15 per day for parking whether you valet or self-park. This is a racket. (3) The inside of the hotel (atrium, front desk, etc) is as sterile as a hospital. I did not feel like I was in Hawaii at all....felt like I was in a local library or office building. It was such a let down. (4) We had a deluxe ocean view room, and I must say, it was nice. Nice touch with the ceiling fan and buffet in the \"foyer\". I would say, the rooms were great...very homey and comfortable. I felt like I was in my own bedroom, rather than a hotel. Large lanai, although the furniture was yucky and had some stains on it. The hotel made sure to point out that the fridge in the room is for the mini-bar and not for personal storage of items. If they notice that their items had been removed to store personal items, they will charge you, even if you dont consume the item. I disregarded that and just made sure I put their items back each morning before housekeeping showed up. (5) Pool and surrounding pool area are small, crowded, and very UNimpressive. Lounge chairs are crammed in, with only a few inches between them. If youre claustrophobic, stay out of the pool area. Also, it was overrun with kids. I didnt expect to see so many young kids (and babies) at a resort like this. I dont think I saw one adult using the pool my entire 5 day stay. (6) Lagoons are OK. nice and relaxing. If you want a spot under one of the \"huts\", be sure to get out there by 7am. Please note that it is a man-made lagoon, NOT a beach, meaning no real waves. Just think of it as a gigantic natural swimming pool. If you snorkel, you can see one or 2 turtles in Lagoon 2, but thats about it. We brought our own equipment. If you dont have your own, you can rent snorkel gear for $15 an hour or $20 per day (again, another racket) (7) I cant comment on dining because we didnt eat there. All I know is that the food is godly expensive, though it didnt surprise me. My husband and I spent our evenings in Waikiki so we ate there. We ate breakfast at the Hapa Grill in Kapolei which is 10 min from the hotel. Their pancakes and omelettes are very good! (8) Service is pretty good, nothing outstanding, but sometimes not consistent. One time I got ice delivered in 10 minutes, other times I had to wait almost 30. Turn down service occured 3 of the 5 days I was there. (9) In case you havent realized already, I hate being nickeled and dimed when I'm paying close to $500 per nite to stay somewhere. They charge you for every little thing. For example, some of the beach chairs had hoods on them, kind of like a pseudo-cabana. I thought cool, since all of the little umbrella huts were taken. I walk up to them and see a huge sign saying that those particular chairs must be rented on an hourly basis. why? because someone glued some cardboard and cloth on it? another example, coffee is free from 6am - 11am. I asked the lady behind the counter if I could have some vanilla syrup in my coffee. After squirting some in my cup, I say thank you and start to walk away. She hollers back to me that she has to charge me 50 cents for the added flavor. This is crazy, but it's not her fault so I choose not to argue. I hand her 2 quarters. As I start to walk away, she chases me down, now saying I owe her 2 pennies because of tax. WTF??? so overall, hotel is OK, but unimpressive. definitely not worth the expense. I read in Travel+Leisure that this hotel is one of the top rated in the world. I can only wonder who's doing those reviews. If youve never stayed anywhere else, then yes, you'll be blown away in awe.

As for me....no thanks, been there, done that. When I go on vacation, it's to recharge my batteries and this place is perfect because it's between 30 to 45 minutes away from the main strip at Waikiki.

It's also perfect for those exercise fanatics like myself that want a good outdoor jog in the morning. - The rooms are all spacious and nicely designed with modern furniture and all the amenities you could need. Most offer nice views -They have 3 nice restaurants and a bar in the pool area - The pool is a nice size and has plenty of loungers and umbrellas - Parking is $15 a day whether it's valet or self parking (however, the self parking gate was always open, so we used that after the first day and ended up not being charged for parking at all) -There is a 24 Hour Safeway located about 5 to 7 minutes away in case you want to stock up your room with any goodies. -They have a decent gym with 3 treadmills, some quality bikes (similar to what you would find in a spinning class), a variety of resistance machines and free weights. They also offer yoga classes at a nominal fee and some other classes. -I didn't partake in any spa treatments but they do have a full service spa. -Internet access is free in their business service center. There are only 2 computers but they did have 17 inch screens. -They have wonderful, piping hot coffee that is complimentary every day between 5 and 11. There is also a bakery that sells nice morning pastries. -Our price was $299 before tax. There service was definitely 5 star across the board. I'm probably leaving something out, but you get the idea. Try it out....you'll like it. No wait, you'll love it!!!", "Date": "May 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is not 5 star - Would not revisit, even if you paid me!\u201d", "Author": "RJB1000", "ReviewID": "UR5040147", "Content": "Firslly apologies this is one of those annoyingly long reviews but it does have a summary at the end. Whenever I read a low score in Trip adviser amongst high scores I think its a one off and always you will have people who are never satisfied. However I've come to the conclusion it's not, its probably more to do where your accustomed to staying. I have just returned from staying at the hotel for 11 nights during late April, which is a reasonable stay, given I didn't see the same people twice during that whole time. I'm a regular traveller and stay at really good hotels both on business and leisure. Why I origninally choose to stay here: A few of the other 5 star hotels seemed to have issues, All the 5 star trip advisor ratings which were given, it wasn't in downtown Waikiki where there is development working happening, it was a JW resort which are supposed to be 5 star and above what the standard of a typical Marriott. Finally because I could also use my Marriott rewards which I had accumulated. Why now I wish I had saved those rewards for somewhere else: Location: I previously read from someone who had stayed there that it was 45 drive minutes from Honolulu, they must have been driving at 3am in the morning. We're fast drivers but generally the trip took an hour minimum. The traffic generally was pretty busy all the time.from Koolina side. When we found the hotel it was located virtually slap bang next to a large industrial park about 1 mile away, with what looked like a large oil refinery/storage park, not what you concure up as a mental picture of Hawaii. Hotel Modern, clean but frankly downright dull, it has an interior attrium which cuts through the 17 floors but so do many hotels now. The lobby etc I felt were souless and dull, there was no ambience at all I felt I may aswell have stayed at an Airport Marriott or somewhere in a city centre. It wouldn't take alot to brighten up but clearly no one has bothered here for years. Put it this way if you're looking for a wow factor and you regularly stay at good hotels you won't find it here. Rooms Had booked an Ocean View room but as I'm a platinum Marriott rewards card holderI was pleased to get an upgrade to a Deluxe Ocean View room which overlooked the lagoon. The room was big, with large bathroom, wardrobe and balcony space. Overall it was fine, I woulnd't say it was out of this world and given it felt about 7 years old I wouldn't want to stay here in 2 years time. Service: Very patchy. Occaisionally it was very good, like the waitress at the pool bar or room service but generally if was mixed and just ok. The worst I thought were the valet's whom I thought were actually building our car rather than retreiving from the car park, best service oddly enough was laundry service which was the best I'ver ever come accross. Food I'm never a fan of 4-5 star chain hotel restaurants often the food is overpriced and bland. Again it depends what you're accustomsed too. Here was no exception though. Breakfast was just ok as was the choice. It was lierally like staying in a Marriott at an airport or somewhere in a city, the only difference was that this place had an ommelette station and you get faster and more effeicient service at the airport Marriott. Lunch: Don't know, if you want anything you have to go to pool bar, nothing available in the lobby, not even coffee!!! The coffee shop closes at 10am, its partly why the lobby area is souless. Dinner: Two of our party went to the main restaurant which was \u00a340 for an italian buffet, they described it as OK but they wouldn;'t be going back. The have another restaurant which charges \u00a340 for an entree we didn't go as it looked like somewhere I'd be happy spending $25 in not in reality probably \u00a380 per head. The only hotel bar apart from the one at the pool was very small for the size of the hotel and again lacked ambience is was just ok, if you've stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai the seaview bar there is 10 times better than this one. In the end we went to Roys at Ko Olina gof club which is 2 minutes away and which produced excellent food and value for money. Worth booking ahead, each time we went it was busy. Apart from that there aren.t any really good restaurants in the area we drove to the Orchid restaurant at the Halekulani hotel in Honolulu instead, which was excellent. There are a few tony roma style steakhouses a few miles away but you could go there anyime you don't want to go there on holiday. Activities: The hotel has a fantastic man made lagoon and beach which no one would deny had crystal blue water and was excellent for swimming and kids. The reef experience...mmm 3 pools with a few baby sharks and a few (and I mean only a few) tropical fish, nice but so what, once you've looked at them when you arrive for 10 minutes you don't automatically get drawn to think again oh I must look at those pools again. Value: When at reception one day another guest standing next to me asked to upgrade their room to the same level as mine the Deluxe Ocean View, I couldn't believe he was quoted $585 by them, I don't know if he paid it but I wouldn't pay any more then \u00a3350 tops even only for 3 days. Who will like this hotel: Those who have young kids and want sand/safe sea will love it, I think teenagers may get bored. Those who only want to stay in Oahu for 3 days and don't want Waikiki Those who like to go to a hotel and not leave it, some do and some don't. Those who want to pay stupid prices to pay a round of golf its on your doorstep Those who want to be an hour from general civilization. Those who don't mind a lack of hawaian ambience Finally those happy with 4 star hotel at 5 star prices Who will not like this hotel Those wanting 5 star hotel Those staying longer than a few days. Those wanting an oil refinery in the distance as a view. Those wanting to do alot of driving driving during their holiday. Those expecting a wow or even just a feeking your in a really really nice hotel Those wanting to eat in good restaurants. Those wanting a coffee during the day without having to sit at a packed pool. Those who want the choice between relaxing at a pool but with the option of going to civilization within 15-20minutes. Summary: if I was visitng Oahu again in the near future and wanted something 5 star, if I was staying less than 4 days I would stay at the Halekulani in Waikiki and if I was staying longer then I'd stay at the Khala Resort instead. During my stay at the Marriott I visited both, even though both have the odd minor disadvantage, they would have been better places to stay overall without a doubt. I wish I had booked one of those and saved my Marriott points for another hotel.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, OH", "Title": "\u201cBest hotel I ever stayed in\u201d", "Author": "Takemetoaspa", "ReviewID": "UR5032391", "Content": "We went to this hotel for our honeymoon.

If you use Trip Advisor a lot you already have read the great things about this property. We did get an upgrade to a partial ocean view room 730 which actually faced the sunset. I think this view was better then just a direct ocean view were you would not see the sunset if you wanted to. Here are some practical pointers for those who are practical people like me. 1.Go to the Grocery store in the town before the Ko Olina and stock up on a few things that I refused to pay for at the hotel. $3.50 for one bagel, $10 for drinks by the pool, $8 for a kids hot dog, etc. We bought 6 bagels for $3 and some PB & J for our little boy who is 3 \u00bd. We would get our free coffee from the lobby and just sit on our Lanai enjoying our view without spending a lot of money just for breakfast. 2.Walk down to the Marriott Ko Olina Beach Club and check out their buffet menu for the week. For some reason the prices over at the Beach Club were less the JW. On Saturday night they had a seafood buffet for $33.95 at the hotel the same seafood buffet was $42.95? The buffet at the Beach club was really good and I think the view was even nicer. 3.I was actually looking forward to getting a babysitter for one night or even putting our son in their kids club. Forget that at $16 an hour with a 4 hour minimum just to go out for dinner for an hour and a half was not worth it to me. Even the kids club at around $50 a day I thought was way too pricey. 4.If you valet or park it your self you get charged $15 a day which I guess if your spending the money for the hotel what\u2019s $15. Except last year when we stayed at the Marriott in Kappalua Bay (which has been shut down for renovation) you at least got something for your parking. They called it a resort fee which got you an appetizer in the bar each # and a discount in the restaurant. 5.If you can bring your own snorkel gear. It\u2019s not the best of snorkeling so why pay to rent their equipment when you can bring your own.

Having traveled AROUND the world and stayed at places such as the Ritz, St Regis, and the Fairmont, I was somewhat concerned. So here are my thoughts about what everyone has been saying. 1) It is far out but when you look at the description on Marriot's site, you get that feel. If you want Waikiki, then stay there. The beauty of this resort is the fact that you are secluded from Honolulu and Waikiki. Yes, the traffic is AWFUL in the am but knowing that, leave early, get your sites seen in the morning and go back to the resort for a relaxing afternoon. If you want hustle and bustle, stay in Waikiki, if you want to relax, stay here. 2) Kids, yes, they are everywhere but I have noticed that trend in all of my travels. And there is nothing that you can do about it. We do not have kids nor do I want to be around them on my vacation, so we went to the beautiful adjoining lagoon instead. And to be honest,the lagoon is so breathtaking that you feel guilty for not taking advantage of it to go sit by the pool. Bottom line, I wish I could go to a resort where kids were not allowed but unfortunately we have to co exist....outside of the pool, I didn't seem to notice. We were also there Easter week. 3) Breakfast...no, I would not spend 50.00 on a bufffet either for two people but they do offer a lobby cafe that has a variety of pastries, toasts, fruit, smoothies, coffee, and juice. Having read the reviews I was expecting that there would be no options, but there is. So for those going - do not worry. Or eat later in the am and combine it with lunch (which we did one day), you will be stuffed till dinner. 4) Restaurants, having lived in NYC for over ten years, I consider myself a food snob to say the least. However, we ate the hotel every night and never once was I dissapointed. If you are looking for a cheaper meal, the lounge has great pub fare and there is even sunset sushi where they discount the food (and some drinks) 50%. And for those that might not know this HAWAII IS VERY EXPENSIVE. Yes, a sandwich (BTW, the tuna fish sandwich is so yummy and fresh) was 13.00 at the pool bar but it was everywhere we went in Hawaii. I paid 8.00 for a smoothie at Pearl Harbor. Even truck stop plate lunches (with are supposed to be the thing in Hawaii) were 10.00. There are cheaper places on the island but not by that much. And what you will save in the meal, you will spend in gas getting there. PS- AZUL is unbelievable and the staff was terrific. Overall, this hotel is first class ALL the way. We had an oceanfront view on the fourth floor and was amazed by the beauty of our view. The bathroom is every woman's dream. Bring candles for your evening bath and really relax. And everything in the room was NEW and tastefully done. And there are so many little touches (along with an accomodating staff) which make this hotel a definite in my book! This hotel is great and truly worth going....Marriot, if the only things people are complaining about are price of breakfast and children, then Marriot, you are doing just fine! The only way I would even consider going back to Oahu would be just to go back to this resort.", "Date": "May 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Washington", "Title": "\u201cA 4 Star advertised as a 5 Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "HAPPYBIRDJZ", "ReviewID": "UR5019098", "Content": "We spent 7 days at the Ihilani. Overall, it was a nice experience. The room was very clean with a very comfortable bed and oversized bathroom. Service was also very good. However, for a hotel this expensive, I just didn't experience what I call the \"Wow!\" factor. I have traveled extensively, and for the price, this hotel was just \"very nice\". It didn't pack the punch that your expect when booking a 5 star hotel and paying 5 star prices. I have stayed previously at the Sheraton Moana in Waikiki, also the Hilton Waiakoloa on the Big Island and the Westin on Maui. This hotel didn't rate above any of these hotels, which are billed as 4 star hotels. My biggest gripe is about the pool area. The pool was constantly overrun with children, sometimes 20 or more. The pool is small to start with. We were unable to utilize the pool at all. The entertainment was also at the pool, so to watch it, you had to peer between the children who were constantly running around and jumping into the pool during the entertainment. Of course the parents were oblivious. Just try to enjoy a drink and some entertainment in the evening, go ahead. The hotel desperately needs to build a separate pool with a water slide AWAY from the bar area, so maybe the adults can enjoy a drink and a swim and the entertainment. Only had dinner there once, it was also just ok. Breakfast and lunch were better. Also, Melvin at the water activity shack was very helpful--great service-loved Melvin.

Despite the constant rainy weather, we had a very enjoyable time. The staff was uniformly cheerful and went out of their way to accomodate us. They seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a great time. I've traveled extensively and the only hotel that matched this level of service is the Broadmoor Resort in Colorado Springs. Our standard ocean-view hotel room (room 621) was spacious and well appointed, with a beautiful bathroom and a large balcony. The free morning coffee in the lobby was of good quality and very much appreciated. The resort is very well laid out and we enjoyed wandering the grounds. We had a great view of the three large manta rays from our balcony. The pool was okay and all the lagoons were great. If you like to snorkel, you can see many interesting varities of fish in Lagoon 2. Dining was a mixed experience. We very much enjoyed the breakfast buffet, but the surf and turf evening buffet in the main restaurant was disappointing. I found the prices a bit high but as other reviewers have noted, there are many good inexpensive restaurants within a 10 minute drive to Kopelie or a little farther in Ewa - at exit 5 off the H1 highway. And our favorite dining experience was at Roy's at the Ko Olina Golf Club. If you read more than a few reviews, you will understand why you must try Roy's on your vacation. Ditto what others have said about the need for a rental car. The Ko Olina is beautiful but there is much to see and do elsewhere, especially if you get caught in a rainy week like we did. We enjoyed trips to Wakiki, the north shore, and the windward shore. The Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor was a particularly moving experience since my dad served in the US Navy during WW II. I also recommend a visit to the USS Missouri where you can walk in the footsteps of Pres Truman, Gen MacArthur, and Admirals Nimitz and Halsey. It is amazing that in one morning you can experience the spot where the war started (the bombing of the Arizona) and ended (the signing of the surrender documents on the deck of the Missouri). Like many other reviewers, we took the 90 minute tour at the Ko Olina Beach Club. They give you the choice of several valuable incentives and as promised, it was a low-key presentation without the pressure that is known to be part of the time share industry. And although we went in with no intention of buying, we liked what we saw and after talking to many owners, we joined the club. Not all, but many of the people who have stayed at both the Beach Club and hotel actually prefer the Beach Club. Based on our experience at the JW, this is saying a lot.

Very beautiful and acessible. The rooms are very large with large Lanais and huge, very clean bathrooms. The view was tremendous from our room EXCEPT, major pigeon problem!!! Somedays it was so filthy we could not go out there, the hotel was very obliging in cleaning it up but very inconvenient and patience trying (and the noise of the pigeons starting about 6:00 a.m., one had laid her egg in our flower box so if you do not want this problem ask for a room without, every other floor has them.) Housekeeping was very nice and polite but many spoke very little English. Ko OLina is expensive but some of the amenities are worth it. The food is very satisfactory not outrageously priced but not cheap ex: drinks are from 8.00-10.00 frozen and mai tais ect.. tuna wrap 11.00 burger 9.00) The lagoons are beautiful but a little artificial, excellent for small children, which there seemed to be alot of. The walking path is nice as is the marina. It is easy to get everywhere from here and wonderfully quiet. The pool is nice, towels are plentiful, hot tub good in evenings for happy hour when they have drink specials, otherwise a lot of children. The golf course is nice, fairly challenging(Michelle Wie's home course) about 160.00 per round. MAJOR TURNOFFS: 12.95 per day for internet access, they have computers available for .15 a minute (we had just stayed in a much lesser hotel where it was free and free dvd player in room) ALSO Tennis is 22.50 per hour but worse than that 12.00 to hit the ball against the wall!!! Parking your car there is 15.00 a day. MAJOR PERKS: Free coffee in lobby from 5:30a.m. to 10:00 a.m. also and this is really nice; if you have a late flight you can check out, they will store your stuff and come back and use the hospitality room or spa to shower and change after the beach or pool.This I thought was great.

The room (15th floor Deluxe Ocean View) was smaller than expected and included a view that was part ocean, part industrial. The neighbouring room's balcony had a clear view of our bed and dressing areas, which required careful attention to the arrangement of the plantation style shutters to allow light and air while blocking unwanted attention. The staff could not move us to the other side and we were stuck with the refinery, the lack of privacy, and with pool noise. The noise wasn't terrible on our high floor, but any lower and it would have been unacceptable. Ask for the \"sunset view\" if you're booking an ocean view before you arrive and ask about the arrangement of the neighbouring balconies. The concierge, front desk and valet parking staff were competent and helpful. The housekeeping staff was inconsistent and we had to remind them several times to refresh items. The hotel restaurants are disappointing. If you have foodie pretensions (we do) you won't be satisfied. They charge first class prices and provide food and service that is of chain restaurant quality. The wine list at Azul is spectacular, but completely out of proportion to the quality of the food and service. Usho Tei has weird overhead flourescent lighting more suitable to a fast food joint. Their sushi was OK, but the selection was limited to the basics. Naupaka Terrace drove us to drive into Honolulu to eat breakfast at Longhi's in the Ala Moana Center when we were looking for more than coffee and bagels. Roy's at the golf club has a decent reputation, but based on our one visit, it's as noisy as a cafeteria and the service is more like a rugby scrum than fine dining. I'm afraid you'll have to travel a fair distance into Honolulu to find truly excellent dining. (Chef Mavro and Alan Wong's are worth the price and the travel.) The bar was better than the restaurants, with good pupus and well made drinks. The entertainment at the bar (Thu, Fri and Sat only) was by a very laid back acoustic guitar player/singer. Sitting at the large open windows, looking out at the darkening ocean over the palm tops with a terrific drink and some soft music made up for a lot of other things. The nearby Paradise Cove luau show was fun, but have something to eat before you go and take a pass on the food. It won't save you money, but your tastebuds will thank you. Whether you're up for the hokey games and ceremonies before the show is your call. The lagoon beaches are OK, but the selection of activities is limited and of course there is no beach service (illegal in HI). A little boring for adults after a couple of days. The golf course was interesting and challenging and pretty much as advertised. My wife enjoyed her half day at the spa, and rated it good, but not extraordinary. All in all, it doesn't quite squeak into our definition of a five star resort.

We stayed there for 5 nights in April 2005 with our then 20 month old son and were treated like royalty the entire time. The room we had was elegant and spacious with a large balcony overlooking the ocean and a huge luxurious marble bathroom. We brought our own portable crib with us and found there was more than enough room to accomodate it without crowding the space. As hotels of this caliber are sometimes not especially \"child friendly\" were delighted to find out how welcoming everyone was towards a small child. There was so much for him to do every day from the daily fish feeding at the lagoon to the stingray pond in the entrance (which was a major hit) and the sheltered lagoons which were rarely crowded are ideal for a toddler to swim in. We were also offered a complimentary luau and show at the nearby time-share resort which we all enjoyed immensly. (Apparently my husband is now a Samoan chief!) The resort is off the beaten track so you do really need a car unless you plan to stay there the whole time and as expected, the restaurants at the hotel are not inexpensive but we found the food was fabulous. The hotel and the grounds were beautifully landscaped as you would expect of a hotel in this class but the best thing about this resort is the staff. No snooty \" 5 star\" attitude here, everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. Staff made a point of welcoming us back with a smile whenever we entered the property and went out of their way to make us feel like valued guests. Our son stumbled and fell once when he exited the elevator (his fault) but no sooner did a front desk agent see he was crying, than she came over to give him a stuffed toy and some candy.

As a side note I must say that a great majority of our trip was a blur because we found out that my wife was pregnant with our first child my son Blake who is due May 21st. So to the nitty gritty. We stayed at the JW Ihilani for 10 days in September to celebrate our 1 year anniversary. After planning for about 9 months to make this a great vacation I was pleased to read a majority of the reviews. I will now attempt to give you a brief but thorough review my way. I. The Transportation. You can not survive here without a car. We rented a convertible which was an added plus. If you are cold natured I do not suggest ridding around at night with the top down, the cool air there will sneak up on you! The ride into Waikiki is not bad at all, about 20 minutes, and the little city next to the resort is great. II. The Food. Food seems to be a major issue for everyone from the reviews that I have read. Yes the resort is pricey, but if you are relaxing and just don't feel like having valet bring your car up then you are trapped. The breakfast buffet is ok and room temp. The omelet station is acceptable and yes be prepared to pay about 40 to 50 dollars. Due to my wife\u2019s morning sickness we ate room service quite frequently and it was quite good. Zippy's in town is an option for those wanting to save a dime but you will get tired of it quickly, they offer the usual breakfast suspects and of course they have the infamous SPAM. PLEASE budget for your food as it is all flown in and when you see an appetizer at Chili's for 14.00 don't pass out. There are great meals everywhere, be adventurous and try new places. Roy's was one of my favorites and it is a stones throw from the resort, great sushi, and steak!!! III. The Hotel. We are Marriott rewards members so I don't know if we received good service because of that but we certainly enjoyed the front desk staff. We were upgraded to a junior suite which provided the two of us with more than enough space, there were days in which we didn't even go into our adjoining room. The staff was courteous and the turndown service was a definite plus. The grounds were beautiful and well cared for. The stingray and shark pools were great as well. The concierge staff was ok but I do suggest that you do your research first and then just have them make the reservations for you. The rooms where well appointed and the smart phones were great. IV. The Island. I will keep this one short. We will be back time and time again and I live on the east coast. We did a great amount of damage with our shopping and enjoyed every minute. There is just this vibe there that calms your nerves and soothes the soul, must be the sun. In Closing. We are a travel happy couple, we try to travel every quarter for rest and relaxation so I m a little picky when it comes to my accommodations and this experience ranks right up there as one of the best. We had just visited Cancun in June and stayed at the Ritz Carlton and this experience was easily twice as nice. I highly recommend the JW Ihilani. The lagoons can't be beat for convenience. We travel with our own snorkeling gear and I was able to see a great variety of tropical fish and coral within feet of the resort. Overall I can't wait to go back, we are headed to the Bahamas next week for our babymoon but my heart is in Hawaii!!!", "Date": "February 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel on the peaceful side of Oahu\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4449218", "Content": "This is a beautiful resort on the peaceful side of Oahu.

The balcony had a nice setup with a table, two chairs and a lounge chair. The bathroom was large with a two sinks, a separate soaking tub, a stand-up shower and a closed off toilet area. The beds are very comfortable For recreation, the hotel has a pool, a Jacuzzi and a lagoon directly in front of it that is perfect for snorkeling. (Bring your own-expensive to rent). There are actually several lagoons in Ko'Olina along the walking path leading to the Marriott Ko'Olina Vacation Club. All are available for snorkeling. (Don\u2019t forget a to get a towel at the hotel before you visit the other lagoons) There are also Kayaks and water bikes for rent in front of both resorts.

It is isolated from Honolulu, which we all thought was a good thing. We did go downtown one day and had lunch at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (one of the grand old hotels right on the beach) and enjoyed that a lot, but we were very glad we weren't staying down there. Before going to the Royal Hawaiian for lunch, we toured Pearl Harbor. We arrived at the visitor center by 7:30 and were in the 5th group. But there is plenty to see while you're waiting for the boat to take you out to the Arizona. Compared to the downtown beaches, the Marriott beach was empty with comfortable chairs for your use. There are only a few umbrellas so we did get down early to reserve on those days we knew we'd be hanging out on the beach. We only swam and snorkeled in Lagoon 1. The water was warm (probably 78 degrees or so) and we saw great fish and even a couple of turtles while we were snorkeling. We did the timeshare presentation for 90 minutes one afternoon and were able to get $100 passes for the dolphin watch/snorkeling boat that goes out of the marina at Lagoon 4. We also did the Fia Fia luau which was eh. I'm glad I did it and the food was good, but it went on too long with too much audience participation (probably to give the dancers some downtime). But you do need to stay to the end of the show - their finale was the best part. The one downside of the Marriott area is the lack of restaurants nearby. We went to the nearby Roys twice (which was fantastic) and drove to an Italian restaurant about a half-hour away one night, ate at the hotel one night (pricey but very good), and called out for pizza one night. For breakfast they do sell pastries in the lobby in the morning where they also have the free (and delicious) coffee available. Great resort, everyone very friendly and helpful.

Stayed at Ko Olina from Dec 24 - Jan 1, 2006. Loved it, and the photos give you some idea. The other reviews say much, but here are the tips. Tip: you must have a car if you stay here; although your entire trip on Waikiki Beach could be car-less, using the bus and tours, here you are about 28 miles away from Waikiki Beach (a good thing). You can use the valet (they drive like maniacs) or park your own car each trip out in the four story garage--always spaces. Either way, your bill will have a $13/day parking charge. We prefer to go in and out when we choose. Tip: free hot cofee in lobby each AM, and great place to have quiet time at 0300 (which is 0700 central time). Tip: the restaurants are pricey (Xmas buffett that was slightly better than Hometown Buffett chain was $50 per person w/out tax or tip or any mixed drinks!) and thus you must drive for good eats on H1, but very easy as few cars out on this part of island. 8 miles away is Barber Park exit (staff has directions if you inquire) with Kmart, Outback Steakhouse, Home Depot and movie theaters. 14 miles inbound on H1 is Kunia Road, with Wal-Mart, many small oriental food restaurants, and a fabulous pasta house called Auntie Pesto's; crowded at night, but great lunches! Also use Kunia Road to travel to the North Shore, Haleiwea and Banzaii Pipeline; a nice route over the mountain by the DelMonte plantations, Ko Olina is a fast 30 mile ride to the north shore via Kunia Rd (less congested than H1 to H2). See my pic of Waimea Bach Park, with few parking thus get there early (like 0800) for a free spot. Also, know that you can take the stunning H1 to H3 across the island to Kunia Bach Park on the east side and have lunch outdoors at Kuleawa Market. Bottom line, you can get anywhere on the island (Dole Plantation tour, Poly Cult Ctr, etc) more easily from Ko Olina than you can from Waikiki Beach, period. Once at Ko Olina is is all Ko Olina, beach homes, townhomes, golf ($170/round!) all owned by Marriott once you get past the gatehouse. Tip: the best rooms are over the pool (despite prior reviewers) if you want a direct ocean view and don't mind every day from 530pm to 8pm some live light rock music poolside). Higher floor better. The two side to the resort, also ocean views (this was my view) and rather than just open ocean, can actually see more trees and mountains. Caution: the lagoon side of hotel is better than the non-lagoon (which we had) as the Laua makes a big raquet of noise nightly until 10pm. Worst rooms are any that face the spa or carport entrance side. Best bet, ask for any room that does not face this and you are okay, and any rooms that face the lagoon or pool, esp high floor, is gorgeous. Tip: ask for breakfast buffett coupon, and they will work into rate; the buffett should you pay for it is $23 each! But they discount for you when you book, and it is a great way to start each day (basic buffett but still hearty, we ate there every day) before spending rest of day by pool or driving around island (and avoiding Waikiki Beach). Tip: each room has a fridge with expensive stuff, but you can move it out and put your own sodas in there (but cannot store a bunch of stuff); they give one ice bucket daily when they clean the rms unless you ask for more. Tip: you must get to the poolside on weekends and in crowds by no later than 0730 AM to get a chair. Everyone catches on and throws a towel and a book on a chair, even though some don;t arrive until 11Am to use the pool! It is a disgrace, we even spoke to the pool manager about it and they have no, and seem not to care to have a, policy about unoccupied chairs. Anyhow, then play their game. A great day at Ko Olina would be to awaken at 0300 (keeping on central mainland time), free coffee and newspapers in the lobby, throw a towel on the pool chairs by 0600 (ha ha, beat them at thier own game), enjoy the spacisou nand clean lobby near the shark tank and stingrays. Each breakfast at 0630 or so, when it opens (big weekend waits after 0800), when it is clean and the food fresh. Then either hit the pool or lagoons (ta DA, you have a chair), or drive up the North SHore (saw training for surf competition including Kelly Slater at Eukhai Beach--ask staff for directions) via Kunia, or easy H3 to Kaneohoe Bay and Kulia Lanaki for the day, or Dole (a ripoff) or Poly Cult Ctr; it's all there-- you will beat the rush for parking by being there around 0900. Enjoy the day, then eat at one of the exits I mentionj en route back to hotel around 3pm (again, beating dinner crowd and in Oahu most resturants serve lunch speciasl until 4pm), and get your suntan lotions, magazines, etc at the Kmart or Wal-mart, then back to Ko Olina by 5pm for the poolside music, then hit the sack at 7pm (11pm central time)... best of all worlds! I do not agree that staying on mainland time is a disadvantage, it actually works well to beat everyone to the punch. Ko Olina is, as everyone says, fabulous.

We returned from dinner and a walk to find a cleaning cart blocking the fire escape right outside of our door, and a work cart with a variety of repair items, including tiles, tile grout, and even a gallon jug of paint thinner! The hallway and our room had a strong odor from the paint thinner. We called and asked to have the items moved, and 15 minutes later found that they had simply moved the items around the corner out of sight. We then asked to be moved. They said they were upgrading us to an oceanview room, but put us in 1219. I recommend against staying in any room ending in 19, as it is in a seem in the building on the ocean side and gives you a 9/10 view of a white wall and a view of the ocean if you lean waaayy over and look out the west end of the lanai - not good. We got moved again to the 6th floor, mountian view and all was well from there on. The service was very good, particularly from the valet folks, who were very prompt, attentive and kind to our 4 year old daughter. The fish feeding at the lagoon at 7:30 a.m. was great. Also, jelly fish come in for 7-10 days after a full moon, but we did not see any, even though we came in on the 8th day following a full moon. The pool was also great-never crowded and great for teaching my daughter to swim. The best thing about the Marriott is that it is away from the crowds of Honolulu, but close enough to be convenient. We drove into Honolulu 3 of the 5 days and went to a nearby exit for supplies and reasonably priced food. You definitely need a car to get everything out of it, unless you are willing to stay in one location. One more point - the 90 minutes to look at the Ko Olina Beach Club down the road is well worth it - we got $150 in credits against our bill, and we also got $30 tickets to the Tuesday night-only luau Fia Fia. This is something you do NOT want to miss. The food was excellent, the setting ideal and the performers top notch. I can't believe they dont have this every night, as it was much better than Germaines down the road and also better than the Hyatt Regency luau on Maui that we attended the year before.

They have a manmade lagoon (which is 1 of 4 in a row) on the property which offers some pretty decent snorkeling and a nice beach. The pool is a little on the small side but it never seemed to get too crowded. We did not experience the large number kids running around that I read about on this site. They have a couple of fish tanks in the outdoor center of the hotel which are very interesting; one holds 3 stingrays and the other holds baby hammerheads and baby black tip reef sharks. Apparently they catch these and raise them until they get to about 3-4 feet long and then release them into the wild.

There were very large glass sliding doors leading to the balcony that had a small space at the bottom where air could get underneath. When the wind would blow outside (the tradewinds were just beginning to blow) we would hear a very loud whistling sound. I called down to the lobby to see if we could get a different room, but they could not accommodate. We did notice that as we walked around the hotel we could hear the same sound whenever we got close to any door outside door. I guess it's just a case of bad engineering. Otherwise, the room was spectacular: Huge bathroom with a garden tub, separate shower, separate toilet; a very comfortable bed with many pillows; tons of closet space, and a nice sitting area with a desk and separate sofa. If I had to make one more complaint about an otherwise excellent resort, I would say that it is a bit isolated on the island. It's a trade-off though. If you stay in a convenient area like Honolulu or Waikiki, you have to deal with droves of tourists and over-population. If you stay in Ko Olina at the Marriott, you are a little off the beaten path, but you don't deal with all the crowds. Overall I highly recommend this resort.

Kapolei Korean BBQ - it was so yummy that my hubby and I went back twice to eat there. Kularb Thai Restaurant - I thought this place made their food bland but my husband liked it. If you like spicey food make sure you ask them to hook you up. Also, for snorkeling gear and snacks you can check out the Kmart in that same food strip. You can also buy all your chocolate covered Macadamia nuts for our family and friends since it's cheaper than some places. If you are a golfer, you must check out the Koolau Golfcourse!

We researched many, many destinations for our honeymoon and narrowed it down to Oahu, since we could fly to Honolulu for free on my frequent flyer miles. Our desire was to do nothing but relax, so the Ihilani was perfect for us. Those who are looking for more active touring, adventure, etc. would be better off at another destination. We didn't rent a car (and didn't care to), but if you want to go off the resort you really need one. Here's our synopsis of the different facilities at the resort: ROOMS: Excellent. Beautiful, spacious bathrooms with a separate soaking tub and shower. Two sink vanities. Very comfortable bed. Furniture is in great condition. Wonderful maid service. Upon arriving, they honored our \"special occasion\" with a free bottle of champagne in the room. SERVICE: Overall, very nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Restaurant servers were all excellent. RESTAURANTS: We were incredibly surprised by the wonderful food. We set our expectations for mediocre \"hotel\" food, but actually had excellent meals every night. The variety was wonderful and we ate every meal on the resort and didn't get bored. The Japanese sushi restaurant is not to be missed! Go for the house-smoked salmon sashimi. Breakfast buffet was excellent with a wide variety. The only so-so food was at the pool bar. SPA: If you want to relax, book some spa appointments! It's a splurge (about an average of $150 for an hour of treatment), but well worth it. I had the Lomilomi massage, ginger scrub, rejuvinating wrap, and a manicure (one of the best manicures I've ever had). Everything was wonderful, and you should definitely take advantage of the non-treatment, general services of the spa (steam room, roman pool, needle shower, etc.). It's all incredibly relaxing. GOLF: My husband and I brought our clubs and played 2 rounds of golf. It was incredible. If you don't care about score and are looking to save money, book your tee time for after 2:00 so you can get the twilight rate. It's about $150 for greens fees, $90 for twilight -- we lucked out and got the \"aeration\" rate of $50. We didn't care about sandy greens, so it was a steal! And there's a Roy's restaurant at the 18th hole so you can have a nice dinner after the round. Wonderful. POOL: I agree with some other reviews that this pool is too small for the resort. But it's a beautiful pool. The music coming from the pool bar is wonderful and the drinks are great! We stuck to pina coladas garnished with fresh pineapple and a beautiful orchid. There were a lot of families with young children around the weekend, so consider this if you're not a huge fan of listening to children play in the pool. (We had fun watching them.) Chairs in the shade were popular -- they were all taken by about 9:30 am, so you had to have a strategy to mark your chairs early. OTHER: We definitely recommend the sunset cruise on the Ko Olina Cat (catamaran). It's about $45 per person which includes 2 drinks per person and light appetizers. It was a blast. There was a good wind that evening, so we were able to go under sail. Incredible, and the crew was very nice. We hope our review helps.

We loved this place. I know many people complain about the pool. My wife and I were amazed at how many people stayed around the pool when they had 4 huge and amazing lagoons right after the pool that very few people used. We didn't even use the pool. Why would you want to? As for jelyfish warnings - there weren't any when we were there, not that I'm doubting other reviewers - it just wasn't when we were there. We had an amazing ocean view room, with a comfortable bed, large lanai, huge bathroom, and a perfect view. They pool area had dinner-time entertainment that we heard from our room. It didn't go too late at all and it wasn't too loud, so it provided some nice background noise. We also preferred being so far away from the hustle of Honolulu/Waikiki. It wasn't a long drive and you did need a car, but I never expected to go to Hawaii and not need a car. I've seen many complaints about the food prices. My wife and I had breakfast there both mornings we were there, and it was well worth every penny. They were 2 of the most amazing breakfasts either of us has had in our entire lives! The prices weren't too bad. The buffet is 20+ bucks, bet our meals were around the 15 dollar mark, and well worth every penny. One reviewer wrote they could've gotten dinner at Ruth's Chris. I'm not sure. Our bills for breakfast were about 40-45 after tax/tip and the food was better than Ruth's Chris. Like I said, it was the best breakfast we've ever had. The staff was very helpful and friendly from the moment we checked in until the moment we left. We loved our stay in every aspect and we'd defintely stay there again. Oh, and instead of criticizing the size of the pool and the noise of it, walk the extra distance and go to the 2nd or 3rd lagoon. It's quiet, only a few people, and it'll be like you have part of Hawaii to yourself. Oh, and if you want to avoid the loud kids and families everyone writes about, don't go in the summer.

Of all the times we've stayed at Ko Olina, we've always been treated with the highest customer service. We were so fortunate to not have experience the lack of service other Hawaii residents experienced. When requested, we were allowed to free upgrade to a larger room without any problems. It could be the fact that we don't take advantage of the resident room rate (kamaaina rate) and pay the regular rate as everyone else does. It is possible that you get what you pay for. The restaurants on the property are excellent, however, they are pricey. For example, since we were there to unwind from our business, we don't drive anywhere but just retreat at the hotel, our food bill alone was almost $350 for 2 Adults, 2 kids ages 6 & 4. For this, we would suggest, especially families with kids, to drive off property to the Kapolei shopping center- its about 5 minutes away. There you will find a bunch of eateries and little shops to gather necessities. In regards to recreation, the pool is definately too small for a resort. Sure my kids were one of those who laughed and screamed, as kids often do, however, I made it a point to have them tone it down a bit out of respect for the other guest that were enjoying the area. As far as the pool being too small, my only thought here is maybe it's that way because of the 4 man-made lagoons. Who comes to Hawaii to swim in a pool anyway? Just a thought. But then again, who lives in Hawaii to vacation in Hawaii?- back at me :-) In my opinion, the only thing the lagoons lack is cabanas, at least for lagoon 1 which is situated right in front of the JW. My husband enjoyed running around the resort. I think it may be close to 2 or 3 miles around all 4 lagoon walkways and sidewalk access. Newspapers and daily activity memos are delivered to you room every morning. Even so, the ice bucket was always replenished. Overall, this property has been our favorite weekend getaway on Oahu. Since we live outside of Waikiki, Ko Olina takes us away from all the chaos of city environment. Besides, your vacation will probably take you into Waikiki at least once or twice, therefore, the drive is only 30 minutes away, the only drawback is the morning and afternoon traffic M-F, which could add another hour to that commute.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cRead All Reviews\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3986346", "Content": "I stayed at the JW between Sept. 26 and 30. Unfortunately I did not read any reviews until my return. I read both good and bad reviews and found all of them relevant to my experience. I guess the first impression I had was the location itself. Ko Olina is far from Waikiki and in a very remote location. You MUST have a car if you want to leave the resort grounds, which I strongly advise for ALL meals. The hotel pricing is outrageous for meals. For a standard buffet breakfast, they ask $23.50. At most Marriott's this breakfast is usually $15 at most. It was actually quite amusing to receive a breakfast bill for $60 for two people. Normally I could eat at Ruth's Chris for the same price. I didn't have any negative experiences with staff, but was told that our room was an ocean-view but had two double beds instead of a king size. Everything else was allegedly booked. Those \"bookings\" must have been relatives of the Invisible Man because the guests sure were not on the property. Being 6'3\" and 235 pounds their double bed was only a twin for me. My wife slept in separate \"double\" beds the whole week. The room and bathroom were unusually large. In fact, I actually measured off the room and made the assessment that you could actually have put (4) of their \"double beds\" into the room and still have plenty of space. The bathroom was also quite large which my wife appreciated. For me, too many mirrors and seats. I don't want to sit down in the bathroom other than on the toilet. The pool is quite small and shallow. There are many kids present, but that's too be expected. The spa (jacuzzi) was quite dirty with lots of floating debris in it. The lagoons are very appealing to the eye and quite comfortable to swim in. However, as another reviewer pointed out, there were jellyfish warnings posted everywhere. It did not stop me nor many other guests, but I was told that three children had been stung earlier in the day. I didn't do any snorkeling out near the lagoon opening, but was told there were some exotic marine life. One thing that has not been posted much is the very cool shark and sting ray pools on site. They are not interactive, but are very cool to see up close. Overall, it was a pleasant holiday. I don't think I would return to the same location, but cannot really pinpoint why. The whole experience was just \"okay\". And for the amount of money you're spending for the week, it just isn't worth it.

We found the service to be pleasant and good. Everytime we called downstairs the phone was answered on the first ring with an \"Aloha how may we help you?\" The rooms are very big and comfortable. The food was great although the resturants are expensive. Try visiting Roy's resturant across the street. You will need a car to get around unless you desire to stay put at the hotel. There is a small town located less than five minutes from the hotel that offers Starbucks and inexpensive dining etc. The lagoons and beaches are quiet and private. I read a previous honeymooner's review about how they complained about almost everything here but we find their review unfounded with the exception that there are a number of familes with children here. If you have children then you will probably like it here but if you want away from the kids be prepared there are a number of children. This did not present a problem though because we often spent the day touring the island anyway, and we found that the familes and children quieted down early in the evening leaving the resort very quiet at night.

The isolated location and basically private beach is what captivated us the most about staying here. We paid $450 for one night in a deluxe ocean view room and a contintental breakfast for both of us. Although I thought the room was wonderful and the resort nice, I don't feel that it was worth the $450 that my husband and I paid for it. Prior to Ihilani, we stayed at the Hawaii Prince (in Waikiki) for $150/nite and had better service and rooms that were smaller, but just as nice. Let me tell you a little more about our experience: We checked in and got up to our room only to find that the key didn't work. No big deal except that we had to go back down and get a key that actually worked. The room was very lovely. We had a HUGE closet, separate living area and an amazing bathroom. They even had a fridge except that you can't use it to put your own drinks in because it has a special lock on it with \"their\" drinks in it. I think it cost something like $3 for a bottled water (which you can expect at a resort). If you want ice, you have to call the maid service to bring it to you (which is done quickly). The great advantage of this resort is that it is basically next door to the Paradise Cove Luau. A shuttle will take you and pick you up from the luau (it's about a 3 minute ride) from Ihilani. The luau is AWESOME and a must see for all vacationers. The view from our balcony was very beautiful (great view of the lagoons and ocean). So beautiful, in fact, that two huge pigeons stole our chaise lounge for the evening to look at the ocean and stars. The only downfall for us was then we couldn't sit in the lounge chair since the birds left little \"presents\" everywhere! The continental breakfast was good. Made to order omelets, cereal, pastries, etc. The only complaint I have about breakfast is the birds! Birds are everywhere here since the restaurant is open air. My husband caught one of the birds eating my fresh, make-to-order omelet. I guess the birds need to eat too! The lagoon was nice. My husband and I went snorkeling and saw some unique fish by the rocky areas on the edge. After spending the morning at the beach, we ate at the poolside bar and the service was so slow. It took a long time to take our order, get our food, get our check, and even a long time for the waitress to take our money. I think we spent 45 minutes waiting and aobut 5 minutes eating nachos. Normally I would not have cared so much about slower service but we had to clean up and head to the airport to fly home so time was of the essence. Overall impression: Everything at the Ihilani is beautiful except for service. Beautiful rooms, beautiful lagoons, beutiful ocean. Average front desk service, average pool side service, average overall impression. Overall, I am so glad that my husband and I were able to experience the Ihilani, but as I drove away I found myself serioulsly questioning whether it really was worth $450/nite.

It certainly wasn't for US & I really wish that I had known about the atmosphere here, BEFORE we booked our honeymoon stay at the Ihilani. I must add that we are both mature adults in our late thirties & seasoned travelers who have stayed in hotels all over the world. The staff here can be pleasant enough (try to make a friend or 2 so that you can get some inside advice), but they never go the extra mile it would take to make them memorable. And sadly, they lie. Blatantly. Upon booking our room, I was told that our Deluxe Ocean View room would have a FULL PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE OCEAN & instead, our balcony view was of the ugly industrial park at Barber's Point & of the Ko'Olina under construction, complete with industrial cranes (see my pics). When I asked the desk clerk what happened to our 'full panoramic ocean view', she sheepishly admitted that NONE of the rooms actually face the ocean. Not actually??? After flying 10 1/2 hours, we didn't appreciate this technicality. The hotel pool & hot tub were jammed w screaming kids, morning, noon & night. No exaggeration. We don't dislike children, but we don't want them invading our expensive, $400.00 a-night-room-vacation either. This factor really diminished the quality of the hotel & the enjoyment of our stay. And, there were constantly big, noisy weddings (almost every day), on every inch of the property. This is the poorer, drier side of the island. Outside of the hotel grounds, there is very little to see or do. Rent a car so that you may explore the lovely northshore & east side of Oahu & by all means, go to the Kapolei Shopping Center for a few of your meals (try Julie Z & En Fuego for some great, local food & at decent price) or drive north to Hale'wa town, which has some terrific restaurants (pronounced ha-LEE-va) or you'll go broke eating at the Ihilani. Lastly, we reserved a table for our wedding night dinner, thinking it would be a wonderful & romantic experience. Our meal at Azul was probably the worst that we had on Oahu & the service was far below par, for what the Ihilani bills as 'An Award Winning Restaurant'. I'd be curious to know what awards it has won exactly - perhaps it was the Below Average, Ho Hum Dining & Average Service award? As a newly-married couple (less than an hour to be exact - we were married on the beach, behind the hotel) we should have been given a bottle of champagne, SOMETHING to acknowledge the obvious (I was in my gown & the staff was told WELL in advance, MANY times, that this was our wedding dinner for 2) ... yet nothing special materialized, even though we were guests at the hotel for 11 nights. The bottom line for us is that the Ihilani isn't special, nor is it unique or worthwhile. We would have gotten far more enjoyment had we rented a shack on the beach of the scenic north shore & watched the sun set each evening.

We had intended to stay at the 5 star, adults only resort Secrets Excellence in Riviera Maya (Cancun) but, a grumpy lady named Emily changed that at the last minute! We had to make some very quick decisions and went with trading in our margaritas for mai tai's. Of course I checked trip advisor to do my last minute research and saw a wide range of reviews. I determined to write a \"definitive\" report to help sort out the current state of the resort and deny or corroborate others postings. Of course vacations are always subjective but I've done a fair amount of traveling to various areas at various pricing tiers and I feel somewhat qualified. I always wonder about the background of posters so I will let you know that I am a 28 year old male who works for an International Wine Brand in sales. I'm accustomed to fine dining and am by no means a snob who can't be pleased but I'm not a \"pushover\" either. If there is no traffic you can get to the resort from the airport in 20-25 minutes. Rush hour (3-6pm) will make that trip 1 hour plus. The resort is located on the \"Leeward\" side of the island; SW. All of the hawaiian islands have a leeward side and a windward side that are very similar. The leeward side is drier and sunnier and the windward side is more lush and rainy. The hotel is located within the Ko Olina resort area which is guarded with cameras and friendly staff who welcome you back from your excursions. It is a very beautiful entrance with ponds and waterfalls situated right next to the golf course. The general feel of the hotel itself is Understated Elegance, NOT Oppulence. The lobby is very clean but lacks a dramatic centerpiece which would be nice as it makes the first impression besides the drive up. You do not want a Mountain View room here, the ocean views are not to be missed. We stayed in room 620 which had incredible Sunset ocean views! Request a \"sunset\" view room as the other ocean views are located above the noisy pool area. From our lanai you could only see other lanai's, the sting ray and fish pond, the mountains in the distance and swaying palm trees just before the ocean which I could have hit with a stone. There are only 2 \"jaw-dropping\" things about this resort; the sunset views and the final bill! It is expensive but the serene beauty of the resort area is enough to subdue your left brain temporarily. We went on an exploratory walk upon arrival which I highly recommend. The layout of the resort is very user friendly, no issues here. The 4 natural/man-made lagoons are simply awesome! I wish we would have utilized them more; we took a dip in the bath water temperature lagoon only once. The water is pretty but the sun would have to be shining very brightly for the snorkeling to be worthwhile. If the first lagoon is too crowded for your liking, just walk a few hundred yards to the next one and it is far quieter. By the time you get to the last lagoon you may be the only one there! By the way, there are two very nice timeshare properties right by the third lagoon, they are Marriott Vacation Clubs and they are spectacular! If you are thinking of owning a timeshare--this would be the place to buy. The 90 minute presentation is offered to all Ihilani guests and they give you ONE of 3 different prizes for your time: 15,000 rewards points, $100 dollars of resort money, or two tickets for the catamaran sailing/snorkel/dolphin watching excursion that leaves from the adjacent marina. Each of these tickets costs $100.00 each so, duh, the best bet is to take the tickets. The 3 hour trip was a lot of fun and you never even lose sight of the Ihilani. We snorkeled on a small but nice reef that had water visibility of about thirty feet--a good beginner snorkeler tour. We saw a pod of about 30 Spinner dolphins that did a few nice aeriel acrobatics for us. Snacks and unlimited cocktails are included. Heads up on the timeshare, 1 week of ocean views per year will cost you $41,000.00 at present and these prices are sure to go up, up, up. Financing is for 10 years with 10% down and an initial APR of 14%. A great investment though--these things are not just yours for life, they get willed to your children and grandchildren. We would have done it, but just bought two weeks at the Marriott Shadow Ridge in Palm Desert, California. The Ko Olina property is the #1 most requested area to trade to, so basically you need to own there to be guaranteed a vacation there. Just an FYI. Back to the Ihilani... This resort is billed as having the best kid's club in all of Hawaii, so be prepared--there are perhaps more children under the age of 12 at this resort than there are adults. If you are taking a \"family\" vacation, your kids will think they have died and gone to heaven! The place where they tend to congragate and make the most noise is also the largest snafu of the resort--the pool! What were the resort makers thinking with this pool? It is absolutely tiny for a resort of this size! At 4ft max depth it is just a plain old circle pool that is no larger than 40ft wide! Kids will be kids, it is not their fault. However the splashing and occasional shrieking of kids in utter jubilation may be too much for the adults to endure. I love kids, and I must say that I do envy their utter disregard for high society and ettiquette but it's going to --- some people off. Just keep this in mind as you are turning red and about to towel smack some annoying kid who just soaked you, your cigar and added the wonderful taste of chlorine to your mai tai: At one time you also knew how to let loose and have fun regardless of what others thought about it--in fact, you didn't even need \"helpers\" such as alcohol to get the party started! Let them have their fun--sooner or later the world and our \"adult\" ideas takes it out of them; or, atleast, most of them. In fact, the concept of vacation is foreign to them--from what does a child need a vacation from? We should learn from those little whipper snappers! That said, I hope someone who makes decisions at the resort sees this and builds an adults only pool pronto!! There are only two bars in the resort and the one that serves quick lunch fare is right next to the tiny revelers. If you must have a pool and peace and quiet; there is a small lap pool over on top of the spa by the gym which has no kids but only about a dozen lounge chairs--if you get there early enough, say by 11am you could have your own little quiet adults only spot. In the same location is also a very small jacuzzi that seats perhaps 4 replicas of Mary Kate and Ashley Olson. The only other jacuzzi is full of the revelers :). The only other significant dissapointment of the resort was the Spa. We had a couples massage and the massage itself was very good, (pricey though, at $125 per person for 50min.) probably my second favorite of all time. The dissapointment was in the facility itself which is sorely lacking in amenities and general areas. Men and women are separate sides, no problem here. But my fiance' said the same as me, there was nothing to do besides wait for our appointment in our robes. The mens side had 1 small cold plunge pool, 1 high pressure shower, 1 small sauna and 1 small steam room and that is it besides the waiting room. Same on the ladies side except they don't get the cold plunge pool. The ambiance just wasn't there; no incense burning, no essential oil smells in the common areas, no lush tropical plants decorating the place, no soothing music playing. I honestly do not see what this spa had won awards for. Many spas you could go to at a resort and spend half a day or even a full day enjoying its ammenities and free common areas. With the Ihilani spa you will perhaps get thirty minutes max besides your treatment before total boredom sets in. By the way, do not wait in the outdoor waiting area unless you feel like donating some of your blood to the local mosquito community. The only location I had any trouble with these pests was at the Spa! Also, they automatically bill you for a 17% gratuity! Pardon me, but if you are charging it automatically--IT'S NOT A GRATUITY!! Suppose I hated my massage, what then? It should just be advertised as an all inclusive price at $146.25 rather than the advertised $125.00. It was kind of insulting. Two years ago we stayed at the Aventura Spa Palace in Riviera Maya and that spa put the Ihilani to total shame, period. The Ihilani really needs to spend some money to beautify and add to their spa or significantly reduce their fees. It was the one thing that really made us see that Mexico has caught up to and in many cases surpassed Hawaii as the best vacation spot for Americans. Many hotels in Riviera Maya are oppulent with decadent spas at more reasonable prices. If you are a spa afficionado and are going to this resort, you will be dissapointed. Don't get too down though, here's some good stuff. The cocktails at this resort were very reasonable, I expected them to stick it to us in this area. A delicious Mai Tai will set you back only $8 bucks and they make other great concoctions at $8 or less. Martini drinkers listen up, every night from 9-11pm the Hokule'a bar has martini happy hour and all selections are only $5 bucks. For the beer drinkers they have some good selections for only $3 bucks as well as selected wines at the same price. The pool bar has on tap: Fosters, Heineken, Sam Adams and the other escapes my mind. The food is very pricey and only average at the Naupaka restaurant (Usually a buffet that depending upon what the theme night is will be from $36 per person up to $45.00) Only ate there once. We did not try their flagship restaurant Azul because many of the entrees were in the FORTY dollar range. Excuse me, but who besides a millionaire is not going to strongly wince at those prices! Lunch at the pool grill was Ok and not too expensive. Our favorite meal was at the Japanese place called Usheio Tei. The sushi was good and my fiance' got the grilled lobster which was yummy. We split a large Asahi and after tip still spent $120.00. Yikes! If you want to be able to pay your mortgage when you get home, eat some meals in the nearest town, Kapolei, which is 6 minutes by car. There is a totally inexpensive Thai place called Ku Larb Thai that had some of the best thai cuisine I've ever had. The place itself is not aesthetically pleasing at all and the service is lax but the food--MMMMMMM!! $30-40 bucks for two including tip and you leave stuffed to the gills. Also, if you like Sushi, in the same lot as the thai place is Hana Sushi. I live in the sushi mecca of Los Angeles and this place was way cheaper than LA sushi and it was also way better; I can't think of better sushi anywhere--absolutely fresh with great service and casual ambience. Dinner for two without drinks was $40-50 bucks and we ate there twice. I forgot to mention the gym; it was very good, really impressed with the new equipment and selection. Plenty of treadmills, one stair stepper, a few ellipticals, plenty of free weights, and machines for chest, stomach and back. Props to the Ihilani for getting the gym very much right. The rooms at the resort are first rate. The bathroom is nice with two marble sinks, a seperate large shower with ledge, private enclosed toilet and soaking tub. A previous poster said they were two person tubs--only if again, you are the Olsen twins! Mini bar is well stocked and the safe is idiot proof. The bed was \"other worldly\" comfortable and induced sleep rapidly--which could be a bad thing. ;) There was a seating area with couch and two chairs, desk and coffee table. The lanai was great with one reclining lounge (padded) and two padded chairs and a table sufficient to hold a good amount of room service (though we never ordered any.) Plenty of closet space and hangers. Good selection of channels on TV. (we did have the misfortune of it being \"Shark Week\" on the discovery channel which is quite addicting but made it very difficult not to be spooked while snorkeling or swimming in the ocean.) Housekeeping was great and usually within a few hours of us leaving the room, only once did we get back and found her still cleaning. We tipped her $4.00 a day and got some delicious chocolate covered strawberries for our generosity. Wow, this is a long review! Overall, I was very impressed with the Island of Oahu--I had visited Kauai 6 years previous and loved it too. I think I prefer Oahu though. We did the North Shore which is beautiful and nice to see how the country folk/natives live. We didn't encounter any hostile or angry locals--just saw a few roadside signs that protested \"American occupation of the islands\". I highly recommend the Diamond Head hike. The views of Waikiki and Honolulu from up there are breathtakingly gorgeous. If you build up an appetite on the short hike and feel like a gooey cheeseburger you can go to Cheeseburger Waikiki or Cheeseburger in Paradise. Order the \"it's all good\" and soon your body will be in a cholesterol coma! Haunama bay has the best snorkeling on the island, (along with Lanikai beach which you can only reach by kayak unless you go through someones yard.) I highly recommend both! Lanikai is the most gorgeous beach and ocean I have ever seen but I've never been to Tahiti. It blows Poipu beach in Kauai out of the water and that beach won Travel Channels best beach in the world for like 3 straight years--I can't believe you don't hear more about Lanikai beach. Frommer's guide said that the Waikiki Aquarium is a \"do not miss.\" You must be joking! Skip this at all costs! The resort lagoons with rays and little reef sharks and hammerheads is 10X more exciting. We were done with the whole tour in less than 10 minutes, no joke. The sharks are what everyone goes to the aquarium to see and they have a total of 3 (no joke). If you added up their cumulative lengths they would be about as long as Jaws dorsal fin! Stop by and see Fannie, one of the resorts concierges' and she will help you with excursions. Everything she recommend we did and she was spot on. We really enjoyed ourselves on this much needed vacation and you will find the setting of this resort both romantic and visually beautiful--but not oppulent. We expected more when room rates are $400-500plus per night. We would return for a family vacation but not for just the two of us--there are too many super adults only spots in Mexico and the Carribean to do it again.

I had read every single review on this web site and others on multiple hotels before deciding on the Ihilani. What a great descision! I reserved directly through the hotel and purchased the honeymoon package for two nights and got a Marriott Rewards discount for the remaining five nights (even though the discounted room nights were suppose to be in Standard Mountain View they left us in the Deluxe Ocean View). We arrived at 7:00p and there was no wait to check in. Our bags made it to our room just minutes after we did, and a few minutes after that champagne and strawberries showed up (yummy)! We ordered room service (after we learned how to use the phone) for dinner and called it a night. Day one was spent at the spa. The layout is a little rough with the guys being on the first floor, check in on the third floor with the ladies area and treatment rooms, the lap pool on the fifth floor, and finally tennis courts on top of the roof. Still a very nice spa with reasonable prices. Make sure you have lunch delivered to the lap pool. No kids (usually nobody at all) to bother you, which is nice. Days two through four were spent at the resort. We ate at every food outlet* they have and got to know one of the pool bartenders quite well (make sure you tell Allen that the newlyweds from Orlando said hello and that we hope him and his wife can make it out here). I'll list the restaurants and our ratings of them. Room Service/Spa - fast efficient and they bring everything you need Pool Bar - pretty much the same as room service Naupaka Terrace - above average resort food Ushio Tei - above average Japanese restaurant, excellent sushi Azul - incredible pacific rim/fusion cuisine, don't miss this *We didn't eat at Roy's across the street at the golf course mainly because we have one right by our house. Day five and six we rented a car at the Hertz at the hotel. Very convenient, we booked ahead of time, picked up the keys and drove off. The hotel concierge was very helpful in setting everything up for us, including billing most of the tours directly to our room. TOO convenient! They were very knowledgable and were able to help us sift through a multitude of options and make the best of our two days away from the resort. Day seven was our last full day at the resort and we decided to do the Time Share thing. They are serious when they say no pressure and it wasn't a complete waste of time. We didn't buy, but they at least piqued our curiosity and added 15,000 Marriott Rewards points to our account. Checkout day we were able to stay in the room until 2:00p without additional charge and could have made use of the hospitality suite for 45 minutes at no charge later in the day. They also held our luggage at the front until our car picked us up at 4:30p. Overall I was extremely impressed with the quality of this hotel. Even though the building is a bit aged it is well maintained and they seem to be cleaning the place constantly. A lot of the common areas are open to the outside and makes for a nice atmosphere. All of the staff were exceedingly professional and well mannered. Housekeeping never knocked on the door but the room was always fresh, all phone calls throughout the hotel were answered using our name in the greeting, and other trivial things that made that stay the much more perfect. Bar and restaurant service (even the buffets) were well above average. We will stay there again.

Here's some things the reviews don't tell you. If you are planning on staying at this hotel for relexation and do not have kids, Do Not Come Here. Family Friendly means kids running and screaming all over this resort. They have only one pool for this huge complex. It was overrun with kids from sun up to sun down. Throwing footballs, splashing and just plain rough housing around. Now, they list that they have 4 lagoons in addition to the pool. There's a reason for this...If you are planning on walking the beach and looking for shells or sea glass, you wont find it here. The beach is basically non existent due to large black, sharp lava rocks. This isn't an option on this side of the island. There's also another problem with the lagoons....They are open to the public. There is nothing more frustrating than paying over $400.00 a night and having to share your experience with everyone and their brother. This also creates a problem in the parking garage. They make you pay $12.00 a day to park in the park garage, yet they have no problem also allowing everyone in the community into the parking garage. So, after leaving to go to the USS Missouri, I came back to a full parking garage and no where to park, yet I had a $400.00 plus a night room. The parking attendant was not helpful. He was oblivious to the fact that the garage was full and he still allowed people to keep pouring in. I did get a nice room with a view, and that's the one thing that I can say did come without a nominal fee. Nominal fee ended up being my joke after my 4 days here. The concierge was not helpful. She gave me some information and said I would have to call to check availability. Funny isn't that what a concierge is for? (She might have done it for a nominal fee, I should have asked.) Anyway, the staff was not friendly. I spent my first 3 days at The Ritz In Maui and wish I had stayed there. No one at Ihilani spoke, no one was helpful and no one really seemed to care that I was there and had money to spend. Because of the location and being so far out, you will find yourself at one of the resaurants. Breakfast for (2) will cost you $60.00 each time. That's the buffet. Dinner / Snack and a drink will cost you $60.00 at the pool. A nice dinner and drink will cost you $120.00. It's pretty pricey and gets a little hard to spend these kinds of amounts on food when the rest of the experience isn't real pleasant. I learned a lot from this experience. I learned that reviews need to be read and pondered. Questions still need to be asked.

The hotel was terrific, spotlessly clean, beautifully appointed with a cheerful and accommodating staff and wonderful creature conforts. We were promptly greeted upon our arrival and told that we were given an upgraded room. That turned out to be a mixed blessing. We had a gorgeous north facing ocean view, but unfortunately we also had a lot of noise all day long from the adjacent pavillion and otherwise. In the morning, we had to listen to the live rock band playing for the exercise class; at midday, we heard the music from the teen activity program; at night, we heard all of the noise from the luau until 10:00 PM and from the clean-up afterwards until around 11:30 PM. To top it off, the hotel is close to the highway, and starting around 5:00 AM each weekday (we slept with the balcony door open to enjoy the sound of the ocean, when we could hear it), we heard the noise of trucks and cars making their way into Honolulu. This was NOT what we came to Hawaii for. I have a feeling that if we were on the other side of the triangular shaped hotel, we would not have had this issue, but frankly, it tended to ruin our time sitting on our balcony to enjoy a drink and watch the beautiful sunsets. Beyond that, the hotel was incredible, with lots of privacy (i.e., away from the crowds) and wonderful manmade lagoons that had very good snorkeling (more than 2 dozen varieties of good sized fish swimming in no more than 6 feet of water near the rocks). Stop by one of the K-Mart stores on the way from Honolulu (exit 7 off H1 is the one we went to) and buy your own snorkeling equipment. We paid under $20 each to buy a mask and snorkel for my wife and me, and for $25 got a mask, snorkel and fins for my son, which more than beat the $15 for two hours that the hotel charged to rent a single mask and snorkel, particularly if you plan on snorkeling at the many other places around the island, like Hanamua Bay, which I recommend. The restaurants at the hotel are good but few and a tad pricey. If you are into the local fare, try En Fuego, which is ten minutes from the hotel in Kapolei. It's primarily a take out place, but you can eat in, and the Salmon Salad ($7.50), Pork LauLau ($7.50), and Hawaiian Sampler ($8.50) were all delicious and reasonably priced. Another hint if you are traveling with a family or just want to eat simply in your room one evening is to order a pizza from Papa John's in Kapolei, but pick it up as they estimate 1.75 hours to deliver to the resort. A final tip is to check your room phone book for coupons, which will yield a lot of deals at local eateries (not in the resort). The hotel staff was very willing to offer suggestions for restaurants outside the resort, and all were good. And, check the Honolulu Star Bulletin that is delivered to your room every day, as it is currently featuring a \"Deal of the Day\" at some local restaurant.

A nine hour plane ride from Minneapolis, it was worth every minute. *Outer-island feel with the convenience of Oahu *Family friendly and comfortable luxury *Two of the four family members REALLY needed relaxation, and got it. Mom read five books on the beach, and Dad took lessons from the golf pros at Ko Olina. *Two of the family members needed lots of fun in the sun, there's no better place for kids and parents to vacation. The lagoons are so safe for children, there's plenty of sand for the most palatial sand castles, and catching the crabs with Hale of Keiki Club was a blast *Kids and adults all enjoy the pool and hot tub *We loved being serenaded each night with live beautiful guitar music and the waves breaking on the beach *Comfy, comfy beds *The BATHTUBS! Ahhhh............. The poolside evening entertainment was top-notch. Only problem is our daughter now wants to be a Hula dancer when she grows up. It's going to be hard to pull off in Minnesota. Very warm and helpful service, from the front-desk (THANK YOU for the room upgrade!), to the valet, housekeeping, room service, restaurants, gift shops, Keiko Club (Hi Hale!), beach staff. It went too fast. Looks like we'll be buying a Ko Olina time share, but worry that we'll miss the Ihilani. All this and Roy's Restaurant too (try the szechwan pork ribs, passion fruit sorbet). What a amazing restaurant, and with warm, efficient service -incredible! Went too fast, sorry it's over. We miss Ihilani! We'll be back soon! Take: golf-clubs sun screen inflatable beach toys - or get them at KMart in Kapalei - try the Thai restaurant while you're there for great Satay and Phad Thai. Chilis restaurant was terrific too. Walking shoes - the paths along the lagoons are great for a power walk. Change for tips - valet and housekeeping - you'll really want to tip these folks, they are so helpful By the way, if your little ones are worn out after a day at the lagoon, the kid's room service menu is great. Ours loved the spaghetti. Do the time-share preview art Ko Olina- it's a lovely property, no pressure whatsoever, and friendly sales staff.

It's funny how you read the reviews of this hotel. I recently stayed here at the Ihilani with my 2 children and husband. We loved it. I originally booked this resort through expedia and thought that being it is my 3rd trip here to the islands that I would try somewhere other then Waikiki. Waikiki is okay but when you book with the Ihilani it's kinda nice being away from the \"action\". Waikiki is like a Tokyo, Japan so many people everywhere all hours of the day. We first made the reservation and needed transportation to the resort. I never been on that side of the island and hearing that the hotel is in a upcoming residential side of the island I needed to do some research. I emailed the hotel at ---- and within 1 day someone from the Concierge emailed me back and started assisting me with a lot of questions. (whom by the way knows what they are doing...) to ask what my transportation options where. i knew from research that they were quite a way's from the airport 35 minutes to be exact (w/o traffic) the Concierge mentioned to me that there were 3 options to get there: 1-airport taxi there waiting 2- Their taxi company Koalini Transportation 3- Car rental My husband and I decided to have the Concierge book our transportation. We were quouted aboiut $60 ++ to get there but it was a flat rate for a sedan. I believe they said that it would be a towncar. Or they could send out a limo for $80. Now who wouldn't want to be picked up by a LIMO!!!! The driver was great very courteous and very attentive. We were very happy that the driver was ontime and waiting for us at the airport. Plus we could charge it to the room! Fabulous! Arrived at the resort to be greeted by the front desk with some wet cooling towel with a ecualiptis scent. Fabulous! That really woke us up after a 5 hour flight there! The staff was very friendly. They did advise us upon check in that the room wa not available as it was not chck in but seeing our jet-lagged children they upgraded us complimentary! Sweet gesture! We checked into our beautiful ocean room on the 15th floor a corner room. Perfect! Sunrise and sunset views. Thanks front desk!! Yes there is an industrial park near the resort as mentioned in other \"negative comments\" but why focus on the industrial park when you can watch children playing in the half empty lagoons, people on a catamaran sailing by, or even the spinner dolphins swimming right outside the lagoons, visble from our room. I don't understand how people could say anything bad about this hotel. About the fee's for parking, Yes $12 a day weather you self park or Valet. Waikiki $15-$20 a day...Hello! Just for self park! And about their being no off properwty restaurants! uh! yes! there are nmot much choices for food. You are in Hawaii, an island!! Not New York! You need to be able to go without the New York Food and eat what the locals call \"Take Out\". The bellmen directed us to the nest town over to our resort call Kapolini??? There was a place called En Fuego, a local take out place. They have entree's for less then $10. I mean food made with Love! the staff there was fabulous. Yes the restaurants there at the resort are a bit pricey especially if you have children who eat like birds. One of the Concierge directed us to a place in that same town to a little restaurant called Jurison's for breakfast, now that's good! sorta like a i-hop or denny's but way better! They do have a unmanned business center and 2 shops in the hotel as well as 3 major restaurants, 1 pool grill and 1 lounge which only stays open to 12 mid night, which is nice. No big activities will pick up at the hotel so plan to rent a car. We rented a car with Hertz there at the hotel. Expect the price for car rental is a little high, but you are paying for them to bring the car to you(: They do have shuttles to Waikiki and to the Arizona. But Arizona is on a first come first served basis. There are fee's for the shuttle as it is an outside company that runs it, not the hotel. Keep in mind you are 45 minutes or so away from Waikiki so the shuttle is cheaper. But of course the daily rate on a car is even cheaper. It's easy to drive arounf, the Concierge had really good driving directions, some with little maps on them. i found that a big help as I am the visual an my husband audio! This hotel is very beautiful and worth the drive, I mean who could ask for anything more, but a beautiful hotel and almost secluded lagoons!

Went snorkeling there and encountered a number of fish and even a large sea turtle - lots of fun. So what's the \"but...\"? We were there on a business convention and were frankly astonished to find that although they offer in-room broadband, they want to charge $13 a day for it! When much more modestly priced chains offer the same service either free or for a nominal charge, we found this cost way out of line. For our five night stay it would have cost more than we pay for business DSL in a month. And associates who DID sign up for it, said it was barely any faster than ordinary dial-up service. A place that is trying to cater to business conventions needs to change this policy. Also the room frig was not accessible for any of our own food. (You would have to pay $25, according to the sign, to have it emptied out so you could use it - so our leftovers brought back from a lunch on the north end of the island just went to waste, and we felt badly about that.)

My wife and I and our 6, 7, and 11 year old girls. We usually stay in Waikiki but decided to get away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu. Travelocity originally messed up our reservationa and told JW Merriott that we were a party of 3. We were given a room with a King size bed for five people. After 3 hrs with customer service they wouldn't fix the problem except to send in two rowaway beds or put us in a room with 2 double beds if available. When we got to the JWM, they were able to move us to a room with 2 double beds. I couldn't believe the size of the room. The 9th floor ocean view room was magnificent. I decided I could sleep on the sofa while my wife and kids occupied the double beds. The sun set perfectly in the middle of our Lanai wall to wall windows. The bathroom was twice as big as my baths at home with 2 vanities. The next morning the manager Joy stopped us at the lobby and not only remembered our names but offer us an upgrade to their specialty room with two bedrooms, and 2 TVs. The kids loved the 2 TVs since they can watch their programs. It was on a lower floor and mountain view but the size of the rooms offset the scale over the view. The staff was great and the valets knew the best places to eat. They tipped us to a place called En Fuego that had the best local cuisine anywhere in Hawaii. If you love Poke or Sashimi, this is the place! You can even order a 4 LB platter in advance if you want. The curry Katsu was great. 10 times better than L & L's another local resturant that I liked. Even the hot spot Sam Choy's, that everyone visits can't match the quality of the food. Very reasonably priced and big portions! Parking is the same cost valet or no valet. We tried self parking it and found the walk with 3 kids too much, so we used valet from that point on. A small tip is advised but you do what you think is right. The lagoon and pool is great for swimming. The kids just loved it and it was hard to get them out each time. The poolside entertainment was good and if you're like my daughter, she watch it front row viewing from inside the pool. We will never stay at Waikiki again!

We were surprised to look out of our hotel window one day and see an octopus swimming down below in the hotel lagoon. The hotel was full, as this was Easter weekend, so the pool chairs and poolside bar/restaurant were both over-crowded. They have the same problem that I've seen in many places, with people saving chairs early in the day and not really even using them.

Yes, the hotel is far away from everything but that is the beauty of it. We have been to many places during our relationship and this hotel is where we are the most comfortale and relaxed. The man-made lagoons are perfect for families as the water is clean and the waves are very minimal. You also have fish swimming with you in the lagoons. The large bathrooms are great because they allow you enough space for more than one person to get ready at the same time. The separate shower stall is a godsend and the rooms are very clean.

We stopped by the hotel for drinks & late lunch, and the two choices were the very-crowded pool grill or Naupaka. The hotel has a strange set-up, where there is only one direct oceanview restaurant & it doesn't open till evening. In fact, Ko Olina is not ocean-oriented at all, more about showy walkways but not comfortable lounging in the hotel. The pool grill is fine but it's really a place to eat when you don't want to leave the pool or go too far from the lagoon. We went to Naupaka & asked to be seated at an ocean-view table. There were only four other parties there. The hostess refused, saying there was only one server for the rest of the afternoon and it was too much trouble for him if we didn't sit right next to the other tables. This was stupid, since the table we pointed at was actually on the way from the kitchen to the lower dining area, actually saving him steps. So she grumpily seated us at a table that was right next to the others and jammed up against a wall - clearly last choice, walking away without a word. We asked the server if he'd mind us moving & we had no problem with slow service, as we were there to enjoy & take our time. He said, you know people say they don't mind but then they do, and I don't make any money. Fine - we smiled, said don't worry. Not so fine is what he then said - I'm here to make money, you know. Lovely, we didn't think you were here for your health but who in the world says that at what's supposed to be one of the best resorts on the island. He also rolled his eyes when we asked a very simple menu question when we ordered drinks, and said \"okaaaay, then.\" The server did end up being very nice, and the service was faster than could be expected, although apparently the designated late afternoon menu is only completely available until the cook leaves about 1/2 hour into the time. But grumpy hostesses and waiters who roll their eyes (no matter how nice they are after they calm down) is NOT when I want in a hotel. I don't care what the cook's hours are - if you offer it on the late afternoon menu, it should available unless you've run out. Staff's convenience comes first here, not yours. To top it off, the hostess who had stomped past us clearly annoyed during our meal then said a big \"aloha!\" when we left.

I loved my time here. The rooms are described well in other reviews so I won't repeat what they say. Our room was spacious (we had a wheelchair accessable room facing west with a perfect view of the sunset) and well appointed, as was the bathroom. We were initially given a smaller room and there was no problem having it changed. The staff at the front desk and especially at the concierge are warm, professional and obliging. I know that should be a given, but we also know that it isn't always the case. I mentioned the location first of all because it's a huge selling point... at least to me. We rented a car at the airport because you almost have to for convenience since most tours run from Waikiki and taxi fare there is $72.50 1 way. The hotel does have it's own shuttle for $20 per person each way, however (booked in advace). If you do rent a car, it's only about 25 miles and it's an easy drive. However, it's important to know where to park so that you don't get charged huge fees: The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center is a good bet, just buy something in the center and have your ticket stamped. Having spent some time sightseing and shopping in Waikiki I was more than ready to get out of town & back to the tranquility of Ko Olina. For me, staying in Waikiki would be like being in downtown Chicago. But if you want to be closer to the city and don't want to drive, then I'd say don't go to Ko Olina. Some tour operators will come out & pick you up from there but they'll ask in the region of $45 per person each way. The restaurants have excellent service with a great breakfast buffet, however expensive at $21 per person. Dinner was a somewhat limited menu and just good, not excellent. My one complaint was that coffee and tea are only available free of charge for limited hours in the morning before 10.00am. After that, it's $3.50 per cup in the restaurants/bars (included with breakfast buffet). That's tough if you need your coffee or tea on a regular basis. The best coffee was in the lounge bar in the evening. I have to disagree with the complaint of the pool being to small. I only ever saw a few people even using the pool to swim in, I'd imagine because the lagoons are so close by. It is not a deep pool so would suit children. This hotel was a perfect vacation resort and location for me. Wonderful golf and tennis facilities and spa and the walkways past the lagoons are nice if you like to walk.

The room was spacious, with a large marbled bathroom, and the beds were outstanding. Our room was also well insulated and generally of excellent quality. The lagoon is steps away from the hotel and great for swimming. Both the lagoon and pool were clean and well kept up, and had a wholesome mixed crowd of young couples, retirees, families, Americans and Europeans. We spent much of our vacation just relaxing at the pool and soaking up the sun on the padded chaise lounge chair. The staff at the poolside bar was outstanding, and even offered complimentary ice waters every so often. This was a much appreciated service that I haven't seen at other resorts. We tried several menu items over the week and liked everthing. We saw several wait staff over the week and they were all friendly and attentive. Another great service was the valet parking. There was a daily fee for this (I think $10 or $12) but it was certainly very convenient. The valets were always extremely fast in retrieving our car. On one occasion, the valet gave us a written directions sheet to a shopping center we were trying to find. I used the gym equipment a few times, and was pleased that the basic fitness area was free of charge. The resort is definately away from Waikiki and Honolulu, and gets quiet in the evenings. We found this to be a benefit, but it may not suit everyone. Beware of heavy traffic in and out of Honolulu, especially in the afternoons and early evenings during the week! We went into town a few times but were always glad to get back to the Ihilani. In terms of dining options, the poolside bar was excellent, and we also had a good experience with the Terrace restaurant. We did not try Azul or the Japanese restaurant. The $21 breakfast buffet initially seemed expensive, but it offered lots of high quality entrees such as baked whitefish, eggs benedict, an omelette station, as well as mizo soup, waffles, eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit, etc. etc. so I actually found the price to be worth it. We had a late breakfast and it sufficed for lunch as well. While you would definately not describe the dining prices as \"bargain,\" they were in line with what we have seen elsewhere in Hawaii and the food and service were always good. We were offered a $100 discount off our hotel bill if we took a tour at the nearby Ko Olina Beach Resort where they were selling timeshares, but we were having such a relaxing time at the pool that we didn't want to take the 90 minutes out of our schedule. We did walk over there one evening and it looked like a great condo resort. There were 1 or 2 buildings done and at least 1 more under construction.

My Fiance was told by a friend that this was the best new resort area on the island. He called and explained that we live here and would be driving in after work on Friday. For over $200 a night (supposedly with a Kama'aina discount), we got a room facing a construction site. We asked for an ocean view, we were told all the ocean view rooms were taken. The hotel was empty! When I made this observation to the desk clerk, we were told that although there were no guests using them, the rooms are reserved by the airlines and travel agents for airline personnel etc and they never know when they might suddenly need them (I think by 7pm on a friday night, they'd know). By the time we got finished with work, packed, then drove over, it was about 7pm. We were astonished to find everything was closed. The restaurants, the activities, etc, I think maybe a Japanese-Eurasian restaurant might have still been open for a little while but dinner orders were no longer being taken or something--- we had to drive to Kapolei to have dinner! The room was pretty, but the view was terrible, as I mentioned, and the bed was so hard we tossed and turned all night. The construction view and dust was awful... lucky it was the weekend or it would have been even noisier. Our room was above the front entrance so we heard cars driving and car doors slamming all night. The next morning we went down to the poolside cafe for breakfast... after waiting at the maitre 'd station for about 20 minutes, we were seated then a woman came over and told me I was not dressed for the dress code, I had to go upstairs and change. First, I was wearing a bikini and a wrap to sit at what they call a \"poolside cafe\" ( I was going to take a dip in the pool after breakfast)....which made it misleading. Second, they could have told me while I stood there in front of the entrance for 20 minutes waiting, instead of embarrassing me at the table ( not to mention I had 20 minutes to go back up to the room and change ). At that point I was pretty mad. The hotel was still empty, and yet we asked again and were denied an oceanview room, at any price. Then we went to the activities desk to sign up for some activities... but we were told that they were all filled and usually need to be signed up for at least 24- 28 hours in advance. How can you do anything during a weekend stay? AND why didn't anyone tell us this when we called and made the reservations? Well, we checked out and went out to Yokohama Bay for the rest of the day---- I wasn't paying another $200 a night to be treated like a second class citizen. At least when you pay $45-50 a night to stay at the Cheap-o Makaha Surfside, you get what you paid for....", "Date": "February 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cMust be something they put in the water\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3164863", "Content": "My husband and I got back from a FABULOUS 9 nights at the Ihilani.

Now that I'm back, and have had a chance to catch up on the reviews that I've missed (one really not good), I've decided that there isn't much I can ad to the most recent review which was pretty thorough. We were originally given a room with a \"Refinery view\" a.k.a. \"Ocean view\", but with a quick call to the front desk with a request for a \"quieter Ocean view\", we received a much nicer view of ocean and mountains that they refer to as their \"Sunset view\". Perfect! Lovely room, very clean, comfortable BIG (King) Bed with nice linens and comfy full-sized pillows (something you don't see much anymore). Beautiful patio, and yes a very large bathroom, but not as huge as some people make it out to be. It certainly wasn't as big as the bedroom, which was very nicely appointed and had a very relaxed \"spa\" feeling. Most people will say that you don't spend much time in your room, however I don't agree, and I do like to have a nice place to come home to, to dress for dinner, and enjoy a nice nap, or place to read in the afternoon. This room was a welcomed retreat. The pool is small, but the beach area is incredible. Some have made a negative point of the Man-made lagoons, but they were incredibly beautiful, groomed each morning, and had a fabulous walkway that runs 1.5 miles around the four lagoons. A great place for a morning walk. In addition, I have to say that the staff seemed very friendly, all the personnel, from front desk to wait staff seemed very happy to be there and very happy to help. I don't think we passed an employee that didn't take the time to great us. One more thing, it was probably one of the best morning buffets that we've ever enjoyed. Everything was delicious and fresh! We were there for only four days, and loved every minute of it! Then on to the Marriott in Kauai (see my review of that resort).

Worth 4 stars, but not 5.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2862152", "Content": "The bathrooms were huge. The bedrooms were not. I agree with one over reviewer who said that they could stand to take some of the space from the bathroom to add it to the bedroom. The bedroom area did feel slightly cramped with a sofa, a coffee table, and a desk, but they utilized the space well and we were never uncomfortable. The rooms were very well decorated and there was a console on the phone that allowed you to control virtually everything in the room, including the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign. The verandahs were a very nice size. We had a \u201cmountain view\u201d room that overlooked the stingray pool, and we could actually see bits of the ocean over the tree tops. I\u2019m surprised that they didn\u2019t call it a \u201cpartial\u201d ocean view room, which most hotels would have done. The service was not something we would remember \u2013 good or bad. The staff was friendly, but there was nothing extraordinary about the service. (To read between the lines here, if you are someone who needs to be waited on hand and foot, this is probably not the place for you, but at the same time, if you hate overbearing, in-your-face service then it is perfect. We are somewhere in between, but the service here was just fine and we have no complaints.) The location was great \u2013 away from Waikiki and the crowds. The downside was having to drive down H1 to get there and back \u2013 at the wrong time of day, this could take quite a long time, as H1 is one of the worst freeways we\u2019ve been on during rush hour (and we live in DC and have lived in LA \u2013 two of the worst cities for traffic in the country). We had no problems finding the resort. The people who said it was hard to find must be navigationally challenged. The hotel itself was very nice and the grounds were well maintained and very nice. The pool was small but it was pretty and adequate for us \u2013 we don\u2019t go on vacation to swim laps and there were never that many people actually swimming in it. The beach was huge, but as another reviewer stated, they could stand to have some more chairs. They actually had more (and better) chairs down at the timeshare resort that Marriott is building a few lagoons over. The food was decent, but probably not up to \u201cfood snob\u201d standards (and I say that tongue in cheek \u2013 there\u2019s nothing wrong with having gourmet tastes, but I get irritated at people who just complain and moan and moan and complain about food.) Also, every single resort hotel review for ANY resort I\u2019ve ever read complains about the food prices. I think people just need to deal. It\u2019s a resort. They hike up prices because they can. You pay for convenience. Ever been to a movie theater or a theme park before and paid 5 bucks for a soda? Same concept. Get over it. I would say from the standpoint of knowing that it is a resort and the prices would be a bit higher, they were actually on par with most other resorts to which we\u2019ve been, if not a bit cheaper. To give you some context regarding our \u201cstandards\u201d so that you have something on which to base this review, we\u2019ve stayed at the Four Seasons on Maui, the Hilton Waikoloa on the Big Island, and the Mandarin Oriental Kahala. Each had its plusses and minuses. Our favorite by far was the Four Seasons on Maui. Then we would rank the Mandarin Oriental a close second and the JW would fall a somewhat distant third. (We loved the Hilton\u2019s lagoon and the large pools, but the rooms were not very deluxe and the hotel was so huge that it was a hike to the rooms and there was no real beach.) Regardless, we had a great time at ALL of these resorts and in most cases, you get what you pay for and so based on what we paid for these resorts, we knew what to expect. I think many people don\u2019t, which is why they are disappointed. I go on vacation to relax and have fun and if you start sweating the small stuff (like not having anyone acknowledge your anniversary), then you may need to reassess your priorities (granted, if you find yourself encountering bigger problems like broken shower doors, then sometimes it\u2019s hard not to start sweating the small stuff). What we paid at the JW was easily less than half the price of what we paid the Four Seasons or the Mandarin Oriental. I think it\u2019s a great hotel for the price. So, overall, this isn\u2019t a \u201crave\u201d review, but we had a great time. We\u2019d definitely recommend the hotel and would consider returning.

Yes it is a little remote, as I have read other reviewers say, but frankly, that is the charm of this property. After spending 4 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, this was a welcome break! The front door staff were very friendly, however, the bell staff were slow to deliver my luggage. Front desk . . .GREAT, friendly check in procedure. Some of my paper work was not in order, and the clerk ensured me that she would take care of it. I was sent up the 12th floor to a deluxe ocean view room. Based on the reviews that I have read, if you can do it, a deluxe ocean view room is the way to go. All I can say is ahhhhh, when I walked into my well-appointed room with truly majestic views of the ocean and mountain range. The bathroom, large, and wonderful! My first stop was off to the concierge to get my 3 days sorted out. I think her name was Sherri? What a delight, very helpful. Let's now get to the spa! Great staff that was very very very accommodating to my needs. With only 2 hours to closing, I was able to fit in the best Hawaiian style message ever and not to mention block a number of other treatments. There was a miss communication for one of my treatments a few days later; however, the staff did their best to fix the situation. I did not get what I originally requested, but a fair discount on a good substitute. The spa area it's self is ok, I did not spend a lot of time lounging, but it looked as if that those who were enjoyed it. I found the setting a little bright. Softer, more intimate lighting would have been more appealing to me. Yes, the pool area is small, however, the lagoons are great! They are where you need to spend your time. There were not a great deal of beach chairs, I was lucky, but a few had to settled in the sand and did not seem pleased. Unfortunately, no food and beverage service at the lagoon directly in front of the hotel, that sucks, but I got over it. I will say that the service as the pool area was a little lack luster at best. Not the bar, they were fine. I felt the need to prompt the wait staff for service, once they got going it was ok. With regard to the eating outlets, I did have room service, which was fine. I also had breakfast in the dining area near the pool and that was wonderful. Other than that I did not have the chance to eat on property. Over, all a great experience and a wonderful place to call home while you are out an about touring the island. I will also say that the front door staff turned out to be wonderful. Always prompt with my vehicle, and eager to offer directions each time I left the hotel. I will be back, and would recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. You must know that I am in travel business (I do not work for a hotel and I am not a travel agent), and am super critical as I am in the business and can recommend to my customers just about any where for thier meetings and incentive travel needs. Service, service, service, is more often the deal breaker for me. I will also say you learn when to have very high expectations and when not too.

I'm sorry , for 5* this place is more hype, just doesn't deliver! Here's an excerpt of my email to Marriott re our stay this past weekend : My husband, 6 year old daughter and I spent last weekend at this resort, in celebration of our 7th wedding anniversary. I booked through costco travel and paid in advance, as I wanted a car as well, not to mention the rooms were a better rate than using my marriott rewards membership and kamaaina discount. (Hawaii resident rate). When I checked in they asked for my 'costco voucher' ..as if they were insinuating the 'po folks' are here! And they were not friendly, no warm smile, no welcome to the Marriott, no happy anniversary. NOTHING> They managed to nearly ruin our weekend because from the instant we arrived the 'greeting' or should I say 'lack of', from valet and front desk was downright unfriendly. It is very difficult to find this resort, we got lost, we were hot and tired and irritable so we just wanted to shower and maybe use the pool before dinner. We realize check-in is NORMALLY 3 pm, even though we arrived at 2 pm we hoped to just get in our room right away. But we were told quite rudely that our room was still being cleaned & that check-in is 3 pm! and to go 'somewhere' and they'd call us on our cell phone. I asked if there was a hospitality room so we could change/clean up get bathing suits and find a pool, and was simply told NO. Since when???? Anyway we hauled our bags out to the pool area bar, ordered drinks and sweltered. We finally got our room, just before 3 pm, (SO MUCH for Mr.Marriott's clean room in 1/2 hour 'SOP' according to that book in the room.) First impression:pretty seafoam blue painted walls, pretty bedding, a long hall leading to huge beautiful bathroom. I entered bed area and saw the 'mountain view'-- in fact--looked down onto a very ugly rooftop (#638-why doesn't someone put potted palms and bouganvillea on that rooftop out there to at least make it look decent?!) ...our main view was 'kitty-corner' into another guest's room/balcony! HOW scenic is that??? I almost cried right then, this was a surprise weekend for my husband, and so far it was going from bad to worse. As I had mentioned when I booked that it was our Anniversary, I expected to see maybe some SMALL acknowledgement-hell even a dandelion in a wine jug would have showed SOMEBODY cared; APPARENTLY at this resort if you don't book 5 nights, you are merely considered a nuisance. (And believe me after 9-11 lHawaii hotels were begging for local business, I guess they don't 'need' us anymore? FACT: Just moments before, a guest checking in when I did was told she was getting a \"complimentary upgrade to ocean view.\" Imagine her surprise? well Imagine MY surprise when I asked the girl helping me if we were possibly getting an ocean view room as I had requested when booking- she said It's $60 a night if YOU want it!\" HOW rude is that??? So, very upset, I called the front desk, from my 'mountain view' room, I was eventually offered by a front desk manager the \"LAST\" ocean view room they had...(yeah right) #405 and believe me when they say LAST we believed it once we settled in-more like \"last resort \"ocean view\", lol. ...well we took that room gratefully; at first it seemed great compared to that other room, much Brighter, same pretty blue walls, but definitely smaller (I think the other room was larger and had 2 televisions, probably to make up for lack of scenery??) same huge bathroom. But the view was part ocean part ROOFTOP (again!!!) only this time the roof of the Hokulea Bar! Ironically the MUSIC that played for hours that evening came not from there but from the pool deck area, right below us. We enjoyed it but eventually shut our doors/shutters. Also the AC was really erratic, hot then freezing too complicated to figure out on a short stay. After we settled in we determined to NOW enjoy our short weekend. Again, a NICE HUGE beautiful bathroom. Love it, good hairdryer, makeup mirror, lots of drawers. Like a cathedral BUT at the expense of decent sized beds and living area...try sleeping with your spouse in a double bed crammed against the closet door. OR the other one crammed between night table and window. Is a bathroom the size of an airplane hangar REALLY NECESSARY?? At half this size it would still be gorgeous. How about bigger beds? that would help. Our first disaster-upon opening the minibar cabinet to get some bottled water, the DOOR fell off it's obviously broken hinge and my husband grabbed it before it crashed to the floor or hit my child...I said Forget it, I'm not calling downstairs, if we complain they may throw us out on the street at this point. Well, later that evening while opening the VERY HEAVY glass shower door, it ALSO came off one hinge and was dangling and I had some time righting it before it hit me in the head! My husband (an engineer by the way) carefully set it back in place. It was apparent it had been repaired before. At dinnertime, as we prepared to go out, the maid came to FINALLY bring us ICE (no machines here- how ridiculous they do come check but once a day in our experience and a bit late!) we pointed out these door problems to her. She was shocked but told US to call for an engineer to fix it, we did not, assuming that SHE ?? would take care of that, being as this was our 'vacation' and we were heading out to dinner. And being as the front desk people had been SO RUDE when we checked in. We just decided to make the best of what time we had, use the tub. And leave the minibar cabinet door Open. Lastly: the chlorine in the pool turned my daughter's light blonde hair green. It is STILL streaked with green which I find very disturbing. Living on Maui, we go swimming several times a week at pools and that NEVER happens here. I don't know what they are putting in that water, and the fact that there is NO poolside shower is absurd, as well as the small size of the only pool for so many guests. So, I am very upset at the way we were treated, I thought this might be a place we could add to our list of favorites. We could just as easily have stayed on Maui and gone to the Wailea Outrigger or Grand Wailea, where they act as if they are HAPPY to see us! We just stayed at Anaheim Marriott for xmas last year and it was wonderful! Even my mom agrees the staff at Maui Hotels are nicer than Honolulu. anyway this resort has potential but NOT worth all the aggravation of getting there and the surly/unhappy staff you have to put up with. They make you feel like they really HATE their jobs and don't do any more than they have to. Hospitality biz? I gues they hate living out that way? or their commute must be a pain...I sent an email to Marriott last night, am hoping to hear from someone at Marriott ...This was an expensive weekend, and a special occasion and they really put a damper on our celebration. So much so, that we canceled our dinner reservations at their fine dining restaurant AZUL (VERY expensive) and went to ROY'S restaurant down the street instead! (and THEY actually sent us a complimentary dessert with HAPPY ANNIVERSARY FROM ROYS piped on it in chocolate.) We had their best champagne and didn't feel angry spending big bucks there at least! Maybe the IHILANI staff needs to be retrained by ROY...lol) Bottom line: I emailed Marriott last night and I called today and STILL have not received a call back re these issues.

We hit terrible rush hour traffic on what was supposed to be about a 30 minute drive from the airport to the hotel (on the western side of the island) and were hot and exhausted when we finally drove through the gated entrance to the resort. Instantly, we knew that Ihilani would exceed our expectations (and many of the reviews we\u2019d read). The lawns were perfectly manicured, the buildings freshly white washed, and the lobby constructed of elegant marble. But the view from our 8th floor room was the real treat. A large sliding glass door led to a spacious lanai with spectacular views of the pool and the hotel\u2019s notorious three lagoons. We honestly couldn\u2019t have asked for a better view. During our three night stay in the hotel, we often kept the sliding glass doors open, allowing fresh breezes to seep into the room. In the morning, we watched the sunlight illuminate the turquoise water in the lagoons, and in the evening, we enjoyed live music from poolside performances as we got ready to go out to dinner. The bedroom itself wasn\u2019t huge, but it was certainly adequate - with modern beach decor (but not cheesy or cheap) and a feather king-sized bed that was extraordinarily comfortable. The bathroom was almost the size of the bedroom and featured a large tub and a marble stand-up shower (my husband\u2019s favorite feature was the bench in the shower). The double sinks were a nice addition, although we predominantly used one of them to chill champagne. We ate at the Japanese restaurant the first night, and while it was certainly convenient, the food was pretty average. (Note to future travelers: We found out after the fact that a Roy's had just opened up around the corner - a MUCH better option). The breakfast breakfast included fresh local fruit and juices but otherwise wasn\u2019t memorable. The good news was that the hotel was relatively affordable overall -- the full brunch was only between $20-25, and lunch at the hotel pool averaged between $10-15/sandwich. The hotel pool food was surprisingly delicious, but the real culinary highlight of the J.W. Marriot was the Pina Colada. This was literally the best Pina Colada we\u2019ve ever had \u2013 rich and creamy with great flavor (and just the right amount of rum). We were also impressed with the resort's spa, which was located in a separate building across from the hotel. By signing up for a single spa treatment, you get free access to the entire facility, which includes a sauna, steam room with eucalyptus (incredibly soothing), whirlpool, and needle shower. The spa was definitely a fabulous way to relax, and the long list of treatments were unique and professional. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who stays on Oahu.

Overall the experience was pleasant but but far from expected given the hype and the price. Our room was very spacious (in excess of 700 sq ft) but very dark because of its layout facing inward toward another wing of the building. The bathroom was very nice (marble and glass everywhere). The main problem was the lack of service. The maid only showed up once a day (usually early morning just in time to wake you up too early) and was told to return later; this happened every day so apparently they didn't recognize a pattern here. We asked for turn-down service on day one and this was done on day two ONLY. Sheets and pillowcases were not changed throughout the stay. Happily they were very good about refreshing the bathroom and towels. The bell-boy told us the maids would restock the ice-bucket twice a day with ice since there were no ice dispensers on the floors. This NEVER happeded. The one bright spot in service were the valet guys who were fast, courteous, and good with directions (pre-printed to all the major attractions!) The pool was small and populated with small children, definitely not a prime place for anyone over the age of twelve. Even worse, there was NO poolside service for drinks, either alcoholic or not! What kind of resort is this?! Needless to say there was no beach service of ANY kind. This lack of personal attention at the pool and beach is so glaring especially compared to the resorts in Mexico. Food is horrible and outrageously over-priced. I'm sure that if you asked, that most of these shortcomings could be met, but the point of an expensive, so-called 5-star resort, is that service, EXCELLENT SERVICE, should be a given, not a request. Our next trip to Honolulu will be at the Halekulani (rated #1 by many sources for service) even though the infrastructure may be somewhat old.

The staff is good and the resort is well maintained. As this really is a destination type of hotel (it is well away from any other tourist activities) you will be largely limited by what the hotel has to offer. My number one issue with this property is that the pool is very small. It is no more than 4 feet deep and is circular in shape and about 40 feet in diameter. It is a very noisy pool because of the small deck area, the lack of heavy landscaping, and the proximity of the hotel building which reflects noise back to the pool area. For a true resort hotel, this pool is a major short comming. The artificial lagoon is lovely and safe for swimming. The hotel does not have any services on the beach though so you are on your own to fight over the limited chairs, drag them to your location etc. Few hotels have great restaurants. However, in this location you really rely on the hotel dining because there is so little else available in the area. We found the food disappointing and ordinary. This will change soon as Roy's (the infamous euro/asian fusian restaurant) is opening a branch down the street. While there have been a number of positive reviews about this resort in the past, and I dont doubt their sincerity, I feel that they are not adequately comparing this resort to what else is available. I suppose at some price point, the compromises at this resort make it worth it. I am not a traveler to compromise especially when it comes to the adequacy of the pool.

What a fabulous place. I can not say enough good things about the fantastic service and friendliness of the staff. I have travelled extensively for a long time and stay in over 100 hotels each year. The JW Marriott Ihilani Resort is among the top hotels I have ever stayed at in terms of room quality, cleanliness, service, and friendliness of staff. The hotel itself is approx 30 minutes of Honolulu, in an area that was/is to be developed as the next Kaanapali. That has'nt happened yet. There is only the JW Marriott and the adjacent timeshare hotel so far on the four man made lagoons. The lagoons are marvelous, provididng safe swimming and so-so snorkeling. And, unlike Waikiki, very uncrowded. The pool at the resort is not very large, but a simple circle that is only a meter deep. Fine for me. If you're looking for nightlife, this is not the place to go. The place is deserted by 10pm, with the pool bar closing at 8pm during the week, but the Holuke'a stays open till 11pm. To me, the only negatives were that there are no other fine dining restaurants in the area outside of the hotel. You need to venture into Honolulu for that. The onsite restaurants are excellent (three of them), but somewhat pricey (although everything is pricey here). We had an ocean view room on the fourth floor. The hotel offered to upgrade us to a higher floor, but I refused since I have a thing for heights. the room itself was spotless, and was very large. Wait till you see the bathroom (it's about as big as the bedroom). The bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in. Open the balcony doors to fall asleep to the ocean waves was heavenly.
