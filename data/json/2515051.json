Overall, we found the staff to be very warm and welcoming. A couple of small nitpicks: charging $10/day for wireless access. Hyatt advertises \"High-speed wired and wireless Internet access.\" They should at least let you know up front on their website that there is a charge for that access. The beds were very firm and my husband had a difficult time sleeping while staying there. The bathroom had a glass walk-in shower, so if you have your heart set on a hot bath after walking the hills of Seattle, you will have to make other plans. The valet parking was, we thought, expensive even for Seattle standards. Aside from these things, we enjoyed a quiet and comfortable stay.

It is in a great location, two block walk to all shops of downtown and easy access to capital hill or Pikes market. You would have to take a taxi to belltown restaurants or walk 15 min.

It may not be early for some but when on vacation I like to have my rest and not worry about alarms, especially on a Sunday. The hotel is also renovating the lobby and there is lots of jackhammering, it wasnt heard in the rooms but made for a less than grand experience as you enter/exit hotel.

We stayed in a King Deluxe , I did my reserach, of course photos APPEAR great, but the room was worn out and dirty ( maybe b/c it is a \"green\" hotel. We also left with a parting gift: stomach flu ugh ! I am so tired of paying $$$ for a hotel that does not deliver what is promises. Next time : 4 Seasons. Housekeeping was spot on but there is only so much you can do with GREEN cleaning products. Other issues: taking a shower is an ordeal, no hot water, no pressure. and just a shower. Carpet threadbare, linen not as clean as I would expect. The pool was cold and the hot tub could hardly be called HOT, come on Hyatt this is Seattle, rainy and cold winters! BTW, I did kindly take my concerns to the staff but \"there is nothing we can do\" was the common response. The spa offers little and overpriced, I ended up going to the Spa at Nordstom , Great ! Hyatt may look modern, you may be a member of the membership tiers, but do not expect any , extras, upgrades, ( what is the point of being a loyal patron/member ? ) do not expect any assistance from management - and Check your BILL before paying , I have given up on Hyatt.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "california", "Title": "\u201cGet a room on a higher floor away from the street\u201d", "Author": "cdrennan", "ReviewID": "UR122935554", "Content": "This hotel is beautiful and really modern.

Another thing - I did not think the valet parking should have been quite as expensive as it was at 30 something dollars a night - especially considering there were no other options! I know that big city hotels charge these kind of prices, but there are usually alternatives and there wasn't this time. The room was clean - nothing special though.

We were supposed to stay two nights leading up to our Alaskan cruise honeymoon. Delta screwed up our whole flight arrangement (never had a good experience with Delta) and we ended up running from gate to gate at our transfers and arriving in Seattle after midnight. Since we did not call to tell them we were going to make it they cancelled our room for the night. HOWEVER, when I called they were already on it. They put my wife and I up at the Hyatt regency around the corner in a big suite at no charge! They asked us to come back to Hyatt at olive 8 the next day with an upgrade over the standard king room we reserved. When we showed up they put us in one of their largest suites at no extra charge! Also, they left us a bottle of champagne on ice, some chocolates, and vouchers for free room service breakfast the next morning (it was delicious)! We were floored. Everything was fantastic. The room was the largest suite we had ever been in, and it was beautiful. Very modern and hi tech! Every person we dealt with at the hotel seemed to know who we were and all about our earlier cancellation. They were all so friendly. To top it off, being the cheap guy I am I noticed they charged me at the non AAA rate I reserved. Being the cheap guy I am I brought it up and hey knocked off an extra 100 bucks instead of the 25 I was expecting. I have never experienced such fantastic service at a hotel! I'm not sure if the hotel reads these reviews, but if they do I'm so sorry for taking so long to write this up. You guys helped our honeymoon be an extremely memorable experience. Thank you so much!

We found ourselves studying everything as we utilized the hotel features. The first night we were a family of 2 in one room, and the second night we added the nextdoor room for two more. Our location looking back towards the downslope enabled us to get great sunshine and overlook a patio. The Good? The personnel in the hotel truly performed, so accomodating. We were scattered about town at the moment of departure, needing to get to the port, and the bellboys called and detained a very reasonably priced limo for us. I had inadvertently left a fancy phone charger in the room, and since it had already been swept by housekeeping but not turned in, the front desk tracked it down for me lickety-split so that we could finally make our way to Pier 66. Hooray for excellent hotel staff! The Bad? Either very thin walls, or the gap at the hallway doors is too tall and the noise attenuation is insufficient. Party hearty types on the one side left us tossing and turning until 3 am (even though the neighbors weren't exceedingly raucous), and then the babies on the other side started their early morning shift of noisemaking at who knows what hour? Also, it would be fabulous if they would actually velcro tape the edge of the curtains which meet the wall. Each morning a shaft of glorious Seattle light would fall directly over the pillows across the two beds. Perfect alignment for no shut-eye in the am!

We had booked the amour package through the Hyatt website that included breakfast, valet parking, turndown service and champagne & strawberries (it was supposed to include bath salts but given that there was no tub in our room their ommission was not missed). The front desk staff were friendly and professional, and the lobby while small was adequate with 2 different seating areas but there were dirty glasses that sat there unattended for at least 1/2 hour. Our room was an average size and modernly furnished in dark woods and brown, white and teal fabrics. The bed was okay (not as premium as at home but still comfortable) - the downside was no king size pillows only regular size so that was a little difficult to adjust to. The empty fridge was a welcome addition to the room and the 1 cup coffee maker was great (but be aware that it doesn't come with directions so its a little tricky if you aren't familiar with the disks). Water is available in the room for $4 a bottle. There is an ipod docking station on the clock radio - just remember to dim the light or its very bright in the middle of the night. There's a gap under the entrance door that makes noise from the hallway filter in or out as we found out from the neighbours ;) it also allows the light to filter in. the bathroom was quite large with a walk in shower - we had no issue with water pressure but it did take a while for it to warm up each time we used it. Only one robe in the room was strange and only 2 bath towels which was fine since we had turndown service but not so great if you didn't. We ate at Urbane and the food was good, the coffee was probably prepared with a french press since we both landed up with grounds in the bottom of our cups but the service was barely acceptable...in 45 minutes we were offered one cup of coffee and when I requested a refill in a clean cup it took a while to come and we never got asked again. We had ordered extra bacon and had a separate bill for that which we left $15 for to include a tip ($5.50 for the bacon, $9.50 for a tip) but when we checked out the waitress had charged it to the room even after I had said that the cash was for tip & extra bacon - the front desk removed the charge but it was very frustrating after the lack of service to then have to deal with this. I didn't like the view from the restaurant... all of the hotels smokers gathering on the corner for a few puffs followed by the requests from the bus stop patrons for cigarettes from the smokers...not very appetizing The pool looked nice and was empty at 11 am when we checked it out but we didn't use it. One last thing that was undoubtedly an isolated thing but there were several drops of blood on the elevator floor when we went down for breakfast and when we used the same elevator to check out at closer to 2 they were still there. We used the conceige for our dinner reservations and he suggested Ivar's rather than Elliots. I'm not sure it was the best location for our anniversary dinner given the number of people in shorts and beach coverups or the large number of families but the salmon was excellent. Overall I'd say we might return for the right price but definately not for what we paid. the rooms were clean and comfortable but it lacked the warmth that we've always felt at the Sheraton or Westin.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "seattle", "Title": "\u201cThis is the place to vacation\u201d", "Author": "briankerrick", "ReviewID": "UR115764287", "Content": "Not a single complaint from our weekend stay at the Hyatt at Olive 8. 2nd floor salt-water pool, Jacuzzi and sauna were great; the room was beautiful and was luxurious in every sense of the word.

My company is located in downtown Seattle so I frequent Seattle quite a bit. I normally stay at The W, however they were sold out that particular week and so I needed a suitable alternative. I stayed for 4 nights/5 days. PROS: -Rooms were decorated VERY WELL with a very modern, upgraded feel. I've stayed at a lot of high quality hotels and I found the decorating schemes/colors/quality to be the best I've seen in a very, very long time. Upgraded travertine tile in the shower (with glass). Granite/Marble in the bathroom. Nice desk area. Sitting chair. Open closet with lots of space. Fridge (good sized) that was empty so you could put beverages and food in it without having to take out the mini bar. -Great location: Lots of shopping nearby. Walking distance to a number of restaurants. Subway across the street. Convenience store next to the Subway, however there are quite a few homeless people that hang outside it and you continually get hit up for change whenever you go in. Either that or some strange person comes up and starts randomly talking to you. (If you've never been to Seattle this is a frequent occurrence). -Service was fantastic and everyone was very friendly (front desk, valets, etc...). -Hotel is very environmentally friendly and one feature that I thought was actually pretty cool was that you need your room key (right inside the door) inserted into a slot to turn on lights in the room. It's really easy to do and it if it saves energy in some small way I'm all for it. -Room was good-sized and had a sitting area and had pretty nice views (I was on the 14th floor. Note: I'm not a Gold or Platinum member with Hyatt so I'm assuming if you have status you can get even better views with an upgrade). CONS -Water pressure was VERY LOW. I realize that they are trying to conserve water, however it was to the point where you would wonder whether it was working properly. I'd rather take a quicker shower with more pressure than a 20-minute shower with no pressure). -I was in one of their hypo-allergenic rooms that are supposed to be cleaned with a 8-step process and I don't know if it was the fabric they used to clean the sheets or what but I itched constantly as soon as I'd lay in the bed. I don't think it was anything other than the detergent they use, but I did notice it and haven't had that problem in other hotels. If you're sensitive to that type of stuff you may want to bring your own blanket and pillowcase. Could have been an isolated incident or just a personal reaction to the sheets. I hate to make a blanket statement that you're going to itch constantly if you stay here, but I felt it important to at least note. -Room Service Food: I usually order room service at least once per stay and I have to say the quality I experienced here was pretty bad. I ordered steak tips and they were very fatty. I was not impressed by any means. The Cobb Salad was pretty thrown together and had almost all lettuce. Certainly not worth the money in my opinion. Aside from the low water pressure and itchy sheets I had a great stay. As I mentioned the rooms were very upgraded and very high quality all the way around (bathroom was gorgeous). Top notch. I would certainly recommend The Hyatt Olive at 8 to someone visiting Seattle, especially since there are very few hotels downtown that are upgraded and have a modern feel. (The W and Pan Pacifici are the only other ones I know of that have that feel).

I've never had to wait more than a minute to get checked in at this hotel, and this time was the same. We were given a corner room with two queen beds, the extra space being appreciated since we were traveling with our children. The room itself was great with a view out the front towards the Paramount Theatre, but the windows along the side of the building looked into the office building right beside. We generally just kept those drapes closed, but the kids did have some fun pointing out people who were on u-tube during work hours. There's two things that make this THE hotel for me when I'm in Seattle. One is the location, as it's a very short walk to pretty much anywhere from here. The other is their restaurant Urbane. This is one of the best places for breakfast that I've found, and while I'd usually prefer to sleep over getting up for breakfast, I never miss a chance to have the Seattle Omelet here. Check out was a breeze. I appreciated Liam taking the time to explain to me how point redemption worked from the hotels side of things. Very interesting.

It is very much centrally located, which made it easy to walk everywhere- Belltown, Pioneeer Square, Pike Place, etc. I do have to say that while I prefer the rooms at the Grand Hyatt, the rooms here are also amazing. The room we got may have been smaller than the one we got at the Grand, but everything is still top-notch. Everything - furniture, fixtures, fittings, electronics, etc - is very clean and modern; the bathroom is nice and spacious (although smaller than the one at the Grand and only had a shower/tub combo); and the bed is heavenly comfortable. I will say, though, that the staff here seemed a lot friendlier and accommodating than those at the Grand (I never thought the service could be surpassed there, but I guess I was wrong). Despite the fact that we made our booking through Priceline, our riff-raff status did not seem to matter to the staff because we were treated so very well and were made to feel truly welcome and appreciated as guests. The service provided by everyone - from front desk to housekeeping to the bar staff - was just impeccable. Just to niggle at a couple of things because that is what I do: in-room wifi is not free, which bugs me in this day and age, and parking is expensive ($38, valet only, but on par with what is offered in the area, and one can always self-park at the 7th and Pike Garage for $30/24 hours).

Every time someone opens/closes the door you hear a loud click and bang. You can also hear faint traffic noise from the main street. 2) we only had a Queen size bed (I would not pay $280++ for a Queen size for two). 3) shower/faucet had very low flow of water. No bath tub in our room. This hotel is a green hotel but personally I like the option of taking a bath. 4) The duvet felt cheap - reminds me of a Courtyard hotel where you just get a bed sheet as duvet. They had a back up blanket (cotton) in the closet. As a Hyatt hotel and sleeping in cool weather, I\u2019d expect they at least have a down duvet or wool blanket. Valet parking was $40 a night which I guess is expected at any major city. Service of the hotel was good. Too bad we didn't use the spa/pool sounds like there are a lot of positive reviews.

This is probably one of most favorite place we've ever visited. Seattle is a wonderful city with so much diversity. We choose this hotel based on the location and that was a \"green hotel\". First, the room was large, clean and the view was a really nice city view. We ate the hotel restaurant the first night as we were pretty jet lagged coming from South Florida. The food was ok, and pricey. We are simple eaters and it was just a bit too fancy for us, but the ambience was very nice. We found a Cheesecake Factory around the corner which was more our style, especially with a pickey eater of a teenager. There is a great place for breakfast around the corner as well, in an Asian restuarant that serves sushi..I can't remember the name of it but it was really good food for breakfast and reasonable price. The server there was wonderful. Pikes Market was a few minutes walk and we took public transportation to visit the Space Needle. We purchased a pair of expensive (Mount St. Helen) earrings and by accident I left it in the hotel room after we checked out going to our cruise. Mid week through the cruise, I realized what happened and from Alaska, I called the hotel and put a lost and found request in. I didn't think I would ever hear back. But I did. The earrings were found and they mailed it back and I received them about ten days later. It's wonderful to know that honesty still remains especially coming from a large chain hotel. This hotel had plenty of amenities, but we didn't have much time to use them, but their guest services and room service people are honest and that alone is a great reason to stay here.

My only issues: A cooler they called a refrigerator didn't work and our food spoiled but they sent up milk at no cost for cereal we brought. The parking was ridiculously overpriced, about $40.00 per day, the lot across the street was $25.00. They make you pay for internet which I find absurd. At these rates it should be complimentary like most hotels. Even low end hotels offer free wifi, no excuse they make you pay other then another way to gouge the guest for that extra buck. Last complaint was the salt water pool which was heated to 80' was cold. Only little kids were in and we lasted about 5 minutes, it was way to cold.

The location is great - very central, close to a lot of good shopping and sight-seeing areas. My room was a Deluxe King and I found it to be a decent size, with several good features such as a large flat-screen TV, sizeable desk for working at, armchair and coffee table, enormous (and incredibly comfy!) bed, coffee maker, a refrigerator (very handy), a safe and all other expected facilities. The room was well insulated from external noise, but I did find that noise came in through the door quite a lot and I could hear other guests going in & out of their rooms, chatting etc. No worse than most hotels I've stayed at, though. The bathroom is also very nicely set up, although it's a shame that the King Deluxe rooms don't come with a bath - I could really have done with one of those! Lots of good complimentary toiletries were provided, along with plenty of white, fluffy towels and a lovely dressing gown. The shower does take a while to reach temperature but I had no problems with hot water and found the water pressure to be fine (though I would prefer a more powerful shower I appreciate the goal of conserving water!). The hotel has a restaurant attached to it, Urbane, which is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and also offers room service. As I was a solo traveller I made quite a lot of use of room service and for the most part found the food to be of really excellent quality and very generous portions. Particular recommendations: for breakfast, buttermilk waffles or goat's cheese scramble, and for lunch/dinner the hanger steak and fries was great. As to wine, the house red is very drinkable, though I was less keen on the house white - a bit too sweet for my taste. Another great thing about this hotel is the fitness center, and in particular the pool. Whenever I used it I had the whole pool to myself, as well as the hot tub, steam room and sauna. The gym is also reasonably well equipped and is open 24 hours which is really handy when you're jetlagged and can't sleep at 4am! So, the only area I felt the hotel could improve is on its service. Don't get me wrong - perhaps 80% of the time, service was absolutely great - friendly, helpful and quick to resolve any queries. Unfortunately this was slightly undermined by some less positive experiences. In particular this has to come down to the housekeeping who cleaned my room, which varied from great to dreadful. Some days I came back to my room and my room service tray hadn't been cleared, there were dirty glasses still left around the room, my towels hadn't been replaced on the rails, etc. In a hotel of this quality, I expect better than that and I think that they should invest some time and money in making sure their housekeeping staff are properly trained and aware of all the tasks they are expected to complete. That said, for the most part, service was great - just this one area that needs work. The other thing I was disappointed by was the fact that you have to pay for internet access. Not sure how wide-spread it is in the US but in the UK most business hotels provide free Wifi in rooms; here it costs $10 a day! These days it's pretty much a prerequisite to have internet access in the evenings when travelling on business and free Wifi would have been appreciated. In all I would recommend this hotel for business travellers (with the exception of the Wifi point above!) and for tourists wanting a central downtown location in Seattle, and I particularly rate Urbane for its great food.

Also great fitness centre. The service however leaves much to be desired. I booked this hotel on a discount website for a weekend, paying half rack rate. The staff were unenthusiatic and the checkin experience alone gave me the impression the Hyatt was more interested in trying to extract every dime from me than providing helpful service. Checking in at 4, I was told me room was not ready but for only another $25 a night I could have an allegry friendly room (which just has an air filter in it) or leave and come back later. I came back an hour back later, and was given the same room that they had tried to upsell me before. If my booked class of room is not available, most other hotels give a free upgrade instead of trying to upsell you or make you wander the city for an hour. The parking is horrendously expensive,$41 per day for valet ($50 with taxes and tips) and when I asked about cheaper options I was told that there was a self park a block away for $28 /day but nothing else and that it would likely end up cheaper to use the valet service. Fortunately a local tipped me off that street parking from 6 pm Sat to 8 am Monday is free in Seattle. It was dissapointing that I specifically asked about cheaper parking and was not told about free street parking on the weekend, closer to the hotel than the safe park. Between the room \"upgrade\" which they tried to get me to buy and didn't, and pushing me to use valet service and not telling about the free street parking, in my first few minutes they tried to get me to spend another $150, close to the cost of my 2 night booking. There was no effort on the part of staff to explain the ammenties or help me with my luggage and generally more interested in talking to themselves than providing prompt service. The comparable hotel chain that I normally stay at gives me free parking, free internet, free bottled water, free upgrades when rooms aren't availble. The Hyatt: $4 bottles of water, $15 internet charges, no paper. Maybe upselling and not telling guests about free parking are part of the corporate culture or maybe I got second rate service because I used a vocher from a discount website.

It's clean, beautifully decorated and the location and service is absolutely top notch. The hotel's best available rates can be slightly pricey but there's good deals to be had if you watch their promotions carefully. I always take up on the eStandby offer of a 60 minute massage at the Elaia Spa for $79. The massage is other-worldly and the spa facilities -- including his-and-hers private steam room and sauna in change rooms, an indoor salt water pool and a large hot tub, which are available to hotel guests as well -- are well-maintained and provide a welcome respite to the cold, rainy Seattle winter days. Granted, sometimes the pool can be a bit rowdy with kids splashing around, but catching it at the right time, you could have one of the most peaceful, relaxing time at this pool. I have found staff at both the hotel and at the spa to be extremely courteous, warm and professional, which further enhances the infrastructure of the hotel, which, incidentally, is LEED certified -- you'd never notice the difference in terms of comfort as I've had some of my best sleeps here. A couple of features at Olive 8 that subtly signals to me that the hotel management actually thinks about and cares about what travellers actually want: - there is a fridge -- not a mini-bar, but a fridge -- in each room. - there is an A/V input panel on the work desk that is integrated into the large flat screen TV, including PC, component and HDMI input -- enabling you to play your own music, movies or presentations in the room and the integration is seamless. The hotel also has a 24hr fitness center with great equipment. My only quib is that the lighting is very low and with dark floor, it's sometimes hard to see -- not a good combination when you're lifting weights. For all of these reasons, I highly recommend a visit to the Hyatt at Olive 8.

We got a couples massage and were treated very well by the staff. I've read other reviews that said the walls were thin. We didn't have any problems with noise, but we were in a corner unit, and there may not have been a lot of people on our floor, so I can't really vouch either way. We had breakfast at Urbana one day, and the food was very good, but pricey. I tend to stay away from hotel restaurants, but we were being lazy that morning.

And now, since becoming sensitive to cleaning products, I could type in comments with the way I could ask the room to be prepared.) After I made the reservation, I called the hotel back and the front desk person also made a special note about how the room would be prepared. I have literally never received such excellent service as I did from this hotel, except at the Nile Cairo; but even so, this hotel exceeded that one in service, and just about everything else, for that matter. At any rate, my mom and I showed up, and just to make sure, we inquired if the room was indeed prepared the way we asked. (It is a pain being sensitive to chemicals, which I only just acquired recently, but I so appreciated this hotel in accommodating me with this.) The front desk clerk checked with housekeeping, and then double checked with the manager. I couldn't believe the service we received. She said the room had not been shampooed and the sheets had been washed in baking soda, and I believe the bathroom was cleaned the same way, as I had asked. Again, the service was outstanding. You would think that you would only get this type of service if you were the president or staying at a $400-$500 room or something. And, they did so, so happily, like they were really happy to see you, and serve you. Amazing. I've never really received service like that before. Thus, we go up to the room and it was lovely. Very cool and hip furnishings. Big, flat screen TV. We might sound like \"hicks,\" ha, ha, but we've never watched TV on an HDTV before. Of course friends have told us about it. And, we must be behind the times, as we laughed and giggled at the quality of it. We were watching something on the Discovery channel, underwater something or another, and we honestly couldn't tell if it was a cartoon or not! It was that good. The rest of the room had excellent quality everything. There were two comfortable queen beds. Lovely crisp white cotton duvets with pretty bedspreads folded at the bottom of the bed. I believe down pillows. A hip cool chair with an end table. Picture windows with nice views of downtown Seattle. I wished the windows would have opened, but they didn't. They did, it seemed, have some sort of fresh air that came in through the vents, though. The bathroom was nice. Like what you would see on the House Hunters show. Very hip and cool, too. One of those sliding opaque, semi-see-through doors. Marble, I believe, floors, and vanity with the sink. A low flow toilet, which went along with the eco-minded theme of the hotel. A large tub, which I wished I could have soaked in, but in the interest of time, I didn't. The hair dryer was very nice. High powered, but not very loud. A rubber handle, which felt nice on the hands. A very nice, one-pot coffee pot. I wish I could have bought the hairdryer and coffee pot from the Hyatt catalog. The rooom was so nice and we were only there one night, it was like, \"what to do? what to do? Soak in the tub, eat room service, watch the nice TV, or go to the spa?\" which by the way was nice, too. They had a steam room and a sauna, with their nice thick Hyatt towels and bathrobes. I skipped the sauna and we ate room service, twice. Equally excellent. Very nice quality. Nice wait staff. The prices were excellent. We're used to paying, I guess high prices up here. We don't really think they are high. We're just used to it, then getting semi-mediocore food. But when you go down to the lower 48, or in particular this hotel, and get the food you do, for the prices quoted, you're impressed. (However, I was just in upstate NY, MD, PA, and Pasadena, CA in April and May, and got sort of high priced food that was mediocore, so this hotel really stood out.) The food came and we were \"wowed.\" The servers brought it on a lovely pewter tray, with lovely heavy silverware and pewter salt and pepper shakers. We had the open faced steak sandwich and fish and chips for dinner. Excellent. For breakfast we had the eggs benedict and the florentine scramble. Very good waitstaff and food. It was a little weird, though, when the food arrived for breakfast the waiter said, \"no toast, just as you ordered,\" which I didn't say \"no toast\" on the phone, which was strange, but no matter. We split all the meals to enjoy all of it. The location is excellent. The first night we walked a block too far and turned back to the hotel. The next day, before checking out, we used their directions and the map they gave us, which was to take a left at the lobby and a left at the first street, and walk 7 blocks. It seemed like we walked uphill and downhill both ways! We laughed as we thought this was kind of funny. It seemed a bit like San Francisco. It was really close and an enjoyable walk. What else? Oh yeah, the strange billing mishaps. When we went to check out the bill was more than I thought. I was there on business and was getting reimbursed for the room, so I thought maybe they didn't give me the business rate. When I asked and checked the bill, I did get the business rate. So when I asked again about the bill, the front desk gal said it was just for some \"miscelaneous phone charges.\" We had taken a taxi service 4 times in basically one day, or less than 24 hours, from the time we arrived, so the nice taxi cab driver was waiting outside for us again. I didn't want to make him wait again, as he had already waited for awhile before an appointment that morning. At any rate, I just took the bill and left and got in the taxi cab to the airport. When I looked over the bill, I called the hotel immediately. There were 64 phone charges! Very strange. They were all to the same number, which wasn't even a correct 10 digit number. The calls started at 6:02 am, the time I called for breakfast, and ended up 6:34 AM, to the same number, some calling the same minute, like 6:02, 6:02, 6:03, 6:04, 6:04. My mom was in the shower and then we were eating breakfast, and then we went by taxi cab to our appointment. I spoke to a Steven, at the front desk, and he thought it was very strange, too. My mom and I laughed, as it looked like I was \"stalker\" or a \"harrasser\" or something, calling somebody that many times, which I wasn't calling anybody! Anyway, Steven said he would take care of it, correct it, and e-mail me the bill, so that I could present it for reimbursement to my employer. I got back to Kodiak and checked my e-mail and the bill did not come through. I called and the front desk person remembered me and said Steven was helping me. They put me through to accounting and that person e-mailed me the correct version of the bill. However, the original high charge was still charged to my credit card. Then there was a mysterious $8.00 charge, on top of the incorrect high charge. Very strange. The only thing I could think of was that either the dinner or breakfast person was triple of double tipped. (It's no big deal, but I accidently double tipped the dinner person as a 20% service charge is added to the bill, and I tipped on top of it. No big deal. For breakfast, I saw the 20% tip was already added, so I didn't add anything additionally.) $8.00 is no big deal, but it was just strange, and I thought after the goofy phone charges, it was just another strange billing deal. I e-mailed the accounting person again, a bit embarressed about a measly $8.00 charge, but again, after the over $64.00 in phone charges, it just seemed strange to keep getting weird charges on my credit card. Plus, I thought the food was great, but a double or a triple tip was a bit excessive. I just checked my credit card and now instead of an $8.00 credit, I now have an over $19.00 credit! Very odd. Oh well. Despite these odd billing practices, which I, and the front desk Steven, (in regards to the strange phone calls,) couldn't figure out, this was a most excellent hotel and I would highly recommend it. In fact, I have already recommended it to 3 people who were flying to Seattle this month, and their spouses. I also recommended it to someone who could put the word out about ecologically friendly hotels for other people consciencious about this on a website. Again, the billing was very strange, but the food, service, staff, location, quality of the rooms, furnishings, linens, and price made up for this. Again, I would highly recommend it and I will stay here in the future. In fact, this may be the only hotel I will ever stay in if I go to the Seattle area again. One thing, however, is the only thing this hotel didn't have was an airport shuttle, which I don't know if this is ubiqutious for Seattle hotels or not? No matter, as we used a taxi. When I called to inquire, after booking, they said there is an airporter shuttle that goes to the downtown area, I think dropping off at a hotel near there, for $15 per person. They also mentioned a metro? for a couple of dollars, leaving the airport, right near there as well. Well, you can't go wrong with this hotel. There is no need to eat anywhere else either. Literally, you won't be dissatisfied. Oh, and by the way, the gov't rate was $159. An excellent deal for such a high quality hotel, in a great location, with excellent staff and high quality rooms. All in all, two thumbs up. Highly recommended. My mom and I still talk about the food, the TV, and those pewter serving trays and salt and pepper shakers! I wish they would have sold it in their Hyatt catalog. Good job Hyatt.

Yet I couldn't love it. The location is on Olive and Eight, hence the name. Its a great location for the city, with the main street to the harbour (Pine) being half a block away (parallel to Olive), and the absolute centre of shopping no more than 3 or 4 (small) blocks. Pike Market is about 8, and very walkable. The area felt safe to walk into town (although I wouldn't choose to walk away from town as there is the I-5 to cross after a couple of blocks). The room is a reasonable size for a city centre, and you're not going to stay for the views. The shower was good, especially with the ability to turn it on and test the water before getting wet. The furniture was also good quality, yet still corporate. The air-con wasn't too loud, yet was efficient. Reception was well staffed, and efficient. The concierge was OK, but didn't exactly own the problem I gave him (I expected more given the reviews). The pool was good. We ate in the Urbane restaurant on the first night. The food was good, if a smidgen expensive. Recommended, but with a slightly narrow menu, worth checking before going in that there is something you want. We ate at Fiorinos Italian the other two nights at Olive and 6th, as it was more our style. I suppose I'm really wondering why I'm not raving like many other reviews. Perhaps the expectations were too high? One reason is cost. It is expensive, and a lot pricier than hotels on the California/Oregon coast where we'd come from. No surprise you may say, but given it was the same price as the most picture perfect place ever right on the waterfront at Lake Como, Italy (which would be perfect for honeymooners) it just felt very expensive. And then they go and charge $10 per day for internet. Really, its 2010! Management, its time to stop charging for an essential service. Oh, and they even charge a $1 connection fee for a 1-800 number. As if they need to with the amount they charge. Overall, its a meh.

Lovely furnishings, but as a previous reviewer mentioned, they really need another mirror outside the bathroom. Difficult for multiple people getting ready in the morning! We had three nights prepaid and two nights for free with our Hyatt points. This confused the check in people totally. They thought we had two separate rooms. It took a while to check in, even after we explained this -- perhaps we had someone new. After the three nights we were supposed to be switched to a smaller room, as the big rooms aren't given for points. I totally understand this, and we packed our things. When we arrived back at the hotel later that day we were told we weren't swtitched. Fine, but I would have preferred we hadn't had to pack -- I would think a look at the computer's reservations would have told them that by noon, when we went out for a few hours. When we checked out a couple days later there was again general confusion at the desk. We had prepaid so there wasn't any money due -- we hadn't eaten there or used any other services. The man checking us out looked baffled and I reviewed that we had prepaid and used points. He couldn't get our final \"bill\" printed and asked for our email address to send it. We got home and no email, but I knew there wasn't any charge, so who cared? Well, imagine my surprise when I got my credit card bill and there was a $64 charge. I called the hotel, who wanted to transfer me to a general billing number, which I didn't think would be the best way to handle it. I asked to speak with a manager, and they took a message, but of course he never called back. I called again and got an assistant manager, who again was quite confused. I wondered if w'd been charged for internet access, which we were told was free as we are platinum members because of our frequency of stays. Finally, after being put on hold, he said they had charged us \"something\" for the free nights?? He wouldn't say why and what it was, but he would take it off the credit card, which he did. All this put a damper on our stay. I shouldn't have had to hassle with them over the bill and expected a return call from the manager, or he should have had someone else call for him.

In the meanwhile just as my path cleared a woman who had walked off the elevator went to the desk breaking ahead of me. I had made eye contact with the Hyatt receptionist and found it very hard to understand why she did not ask the woman to wait her turn. Instead she and the other guest had a lengthy exchange during which others of her party congregated and one of the party was also assisted by the staffer, with her getting a bellman to locate and return the luggage of one of the gathered party. When they were done I stepped to the desk and I told the woman that I had been next in line and she looked at me blankly. It was not the best of ways to start the stay. I like the hotel and the minimalist look of the lobby. Many of the other guests I encountered were European, most were young. The room was as I requested on a high floor. I liked the shower, and found the water pressure okay. I did not understand how to use the dual flush toilets and it seemed to me that while trying to save on paper, etc. that more explanation of the room and its green elements might help people like me who had never encountered a dual flush toilet, etc. I slept well and did not hear noises from the other rooms.

The Hyatt at Olive 8 is an amazing facility and I highly recommend staying here.

The staff at the hotel are beyond helpful, friendly and dare I say genuinely interested in making sure you have everything you need. I had key problems at my room door (my fault \u2013 don\u2019t keep your room key in your pocked in the hot tub) and they sent someone up to get me in my room within minutes. The room is gorgeous. The king bed was super comfortable, the pillows were perfect and I think I need to buy some for my place. My room had a 37\u201d LG LCD TV. Most network and basic cable stations came in fine however I was having with the ESPN channels. At the side of the bed was an iHome AM/FM iPod dock which was great for my iPhone to charge each night. The room also had a small refrigerator and mini bar area. The bathroom was interesting with a big sliding door which was different. The shower was a stand up shower, glass half enclosure with a stone floor. I like hot showers, it was with delight that I saw the mirror after the shower. The middle section of the mirror did not fog up, the rest did. It was clearly a rectangle and meant to happen. It was great. The fitness and pool facilities are very well designed and luxurious. The pool is a good temperature and slightly salted. Around the pool are lounge chairs which are always stocked with fresh towels. The pool is open at 5:30 am so I was able to turn some laps before the conference each day. The locker room has a steam room, sauna, showers, lockers and basic essentials like razors, combs, shaving cream, after shave\u2026 etc. There are also water coolers in the gym and locker room. There is also a full spa with massages and treatments for extra, I did not partake in any of that. The cons: I feel that a place as expensive at the Hyatt at Olive 8 shouldn\u2019t \u201cnickel and dime\u201d you for certain things. It is 2010, wi-fi should be included in the cost of a room by now. I found the $10 internet fee per each 24 hours to be offensive. Also there were bottles of Aquafina in the room, but they were $4 each! I get free wi-fi and water at a Holiday Inn Express I should certainly get it in a luxurious place like this. That said, I highly recommend this hotel. I had friends at places nearby the convention center with similar cost and a much lesser hotel.

Diamond breakfast amenity is a free entree and a free drink (juice OR coffee - not both) and you need to present a voucher that the front desk might or might not remember to give you.

My car was always available when I called in advance for it. There is street parking in the blocks around the hotel (mostly west and north), but that part of the Seattle gets a bit sketchy and parking rules are a bit arcane, so I wouldn't recommend it for a first-time visitor.

Our server then told us it was only a main course per adult that was included and that the children's meals would come on a separate bill, even though we said we had a family package. We ordered and she left. When we got the bill we asked again, as we were pretty sure the kid's meals were supposed to be included as well.

We were given our keys and truck when it was brought up and when getting in it was noticed right away. The wall (stucco/cement/paint) was still very visible and there was no way you could have not realized you did it and the mirror itself was hanging out!. We had to wait about an additional 45 minutes to depart (with 2 young kids) while they tried to sort it out and get claim forms and try to find duct tape so we could see to drive as changing lanes in Seattle is very difficult without mirrors. No one from the hotel made a move to see what the problem was, when I went in to take a child to the restroom - I mentioned it to the front desk and they seemed unmoved. In the end we did get a check to cover the exact amount of damages after providing then with 2 estimates from 2 different repair shops. 2) Spa staff gave my husband his receipt for the services that I had arranged to be billed to our room and asked NOT to provide him with any receipt or bill!

We did an \u201ce-Stand by\u201d upgrade from a deluxe to a superior queen/queen room and got it! It was an enormous corner room; I would recommend booking this room as it was approx 300sf larger than the deluxe rooms. Another plus was that it had a long entrance hall which made disturbance from hallway noise impossible. I have to say I\u2019m a little confused by some of the reviews here. Coming from California, I was already familiar with low flow shower heads which have been code here for years. The water saving flush feature on the toilet (as one guest complained) could have been quickly fixed by holding down the flush button! The most perplexing of the reviews was how someone felt they might have been treated better at the Holiday Inn. Let\u2019s not compare apples with oranges here people! A traveler who enjoys the value of a Holiday Inn wouldn\u2019t appreciated the advantages of staying in a smoke-free, LEED certified hotel like the Olive 8.

The decor is elegant and calm. The room was spacious and well-appointed. I particularly like the oversized sliding wood-and-frosted-glass doors on the closet and the shower, which give the room a more upscale feel compared to regular doors. The glass-walled walk-in shower was a nice plus, though I personally would have designed it with dual shower heads. The bed was comfortable and the wireless Internet service, while not free, was fast and reliable. Service at the hotel was excellent. Wake up calls are made by humans rather than machines and come with an optional 10-minute followup call. One morning I accidentally left the phone off the hook after the first call, and the hotel sent someone to knock on my door and make sure I was awake. Now that's customer service. The gym is spotless and outfitted with plenty of quality equipment including treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and a complete set of weight stations. The pieces of aerobic equipment all have individual television screens, of course. The Hyatt hotels with condos attached are often known for the quality of their gyms, and this one is no exception. If it just had the stunning view of the fitness center at the Sheraton, it would be perfect. But it was close enough. For swimmers there's a 65 foot saline lap pool, which was a real treat and something I haven't found at any other downtown property. And there's a complete day spa on the property, which I did not get to sample this trip. Breakfast at the Urbane was good (my waiter the first morning spoiled me by bringing steamed milk for the coffee), though I'd still trek over to Toulouse Petite on Queen Anne for their pain perdu if I had time. The only thing that marred my stay at the Hyatt at Olive 8 was a very loud bunch of kids partying in the room next door until the wee hours of the morning.

We stayed in a corner room so I cant say we expreinced the noise that the other people did. I really liked the concept of the key switch controlled by the card because many times I forget to turn off the lights when leaving a room. I also liked the shower without the door however I found the shower head and the pressure of the water rather annoying. Since we had a corner room we were looking right into someone's office and since it was over the weekend it wasnt a big deal. I would def stay here again because it is a beautiful hotel with great service and you cannot beat the location. It is walking distance to great shopping, Pikes Place and so close to so many attractions in Seattle. I wouldnt reccomend eating at the restaurant as we thought the food was less than average there.

Had to ask to have wifi charge removed because they double billed me for internet. They fixed it without a fuss. Tmobile is the wifi carrier and they seem to have a problem with macintosh hardware in general. Room was reasonably quiet given the city environs. Windows not operable. Room still has a bit of the new carpet smell from the construction but not overpowering. Room service was fine. Parking is expensive around $36/day with tax for valet. Service however was excellent. Staff was very helpful. Hyatt uses overly smelly hair/soap products in room - did not like. However the locker rooms for the pool/gym have better products which I took back to my room in the little cups they had out for the mouthwash. In room coffee is lame - Hyatt should switch to whatever Hilton is using because it is better stuff. Did not even have real milk/creamer for coffee just powder. This is not the best western so they could do a little better with that. No coffee shop in hotel but there is a starbucks at the hyatt grand and other places nearby.

Both were absolutely amazing! We had our room at the Hyatt at Olive 8 for five nights, and it became our home away from home. It was a great way to be introduced to a city that fast became a must-return destination. Some highlights: - They upgraded us to a corner room (I was celebrating my birthday, and that was such a nice treat!) - The location is convenient to everything, even a Whole Foods grocery a few blocks in the opposite direction from Pike Place - The styling is modern and sleek - We had a roomy, EMPTY mini-fridge! We LOVE the empty fridge and are not minibar people, so this is a huge plus, especially when walking back and forth from Pike Place all the time with yummy snacks. - The fog-free mirror was cool, just one of those little touches that remind you you're not at home The only downsides, none of which was a big deal for us but could be for someone else: - Our wireless Internet didn't work -- they did provide us with a wired connection, though - We only had one robe in the room (huh?) - The sliding door on the bathroom would be inappropriate for anyone sharing a room who was not very familiar with their roommate - There's no tub, so don't bring bubble bath. It's a step-in shower only. - Because the hotel is so new, our driver took us to the other Hyatt and tried to unload the bags despite our insisting we were at the wrong place (that's not a Hyatt issue, it's a driver issue, but be prepared to be taken to the Grand Hyatt by mistake) All in all, I was very impressed with the service, location, room, and all-around convenience of staying at this hotel.

Location was fine and intitial impression is good but the staff was incompetent on top of having a strange facility to work in. Part of the hotel floors are full time condos and the rest are normal hotel rooms. I'm not sure which were first but this hotel has the SLOWEST elevators known to mankind and the mixed use may be the reason. This was the NOISIEST Hotel we have EVER stayed in without exception. The design of the hotel puts the rooms in a culdesac arrangement that allows you to hear even normal conversation in the rooms around you. Every time someone closes their entry door in the rooms around you it sounds like your room door closing. The worst part of this stay is that they put us on a floor with what appeared to be a bachlorette party (no guys) that reserved most of the floor, even though we asked for a quiet room at check in. The noise started at 11pm, security came up and asked them to be quiet, no better. We could hear every word while the drunk girls are angrily asking who is complaining. The second time they asked the girls to leave to party and it was quiet for a couple of hours. At 3 am, after hearing a fight conversation because the girls ran out of beer, I called the desk and asked to be put on a different floor first thing in the morning. They agreed to do so. 5 minutes later a \"Security\" person knocks on our door to hand me a key while the drunk girls are looking at our door saying \"That's the room that turned us in\" , unbelievable. The next morning I went down to get a luggage cart to move to the new room (we had 2 weeks worth of stuff on our way to Victoria BC for vacation) and was told I could only use a bellman and was refused the use of a cart. I had all I could take of the staff at that point and moved the bags in two trips with my wife. The second day in the new room, staring at the office workers in the next building, was ok except for the slamming doors and hearing the couple next door make their breakfast plans for the morning. Non noise issue, all of the pillows are the same, firm. So, if you're planning a bachelor or bachlorette party, grad or prom party this is a great choice.

The best thing is that usually there is no one in the pool area - mostly 5 people. I really have nothing negative to say except that I personally didn't like the food at the Urbane restaurant but I am a very picky eater so it doesn't mean the food was bad. Happy hour was great - the food was really cheap. One comment on the bathroom door - I was with my wife so it didn't really matter to me but if I was with anyone else I wouldn't be comfortable using the restroom/shower since the door doesn't lock, it just slides in without attaching with anything. I tried looking inside while the door was all the way shut and you could see the inside so it's really something to look into.... again if you are traveling with your spouse it's not an issue. There is no real great view from this hotel but it's nothing that can be changed. We had a high floor but we only saw buildings, nothing else. Also, I wish since this is a green hotel there was a green area for guests (small grassy area or patio style place). There was really nowhere to hang out in the hotel if you wanted to come out of the room, the lobby is kind of small and has no private places to sit down and relax.

Beyond the fact that we chose this hotel for the pool and spa and upon arrival were told they were out of service, Hyatt robbed me and my wife of more than $2,000 during our three night stay, making our vacation utterly useless... After negotiating a refund for our final night's stay due to the lack of amenities described on their website, we patiently awaited the credit to our account (in addition to a $400 credit we were supposed to receive from gift certificates we presented at the front desk). None of these credits showed up, and the next morning, we were charged three times the full amount of our three night stay! Although Hyatt had deposited our gift certificates, they never bothered to give us the credit! Management apologized (not adequately, FYI) but gave no clear explanation of why this happened. After speaking to my bank, the manager (name of JP) promptly left for four days to go on vacation, leaving us with his trusty Assistant, Claudia. Claudia continuously apologized, but was unable to change the fact that all three of our bank accounts were down to ZERO (one of them was in the red), because of their \"mistake\" (I am being generous calling it a mistake, as since then several things have happened to lead me to believe this might have been malicious). Claudia then told us to have drinks on the house. We asked if two friends could join us and she agreed. Our last night we spent drinking with a couple friends, trying to enjoy ourselves since we had been stuck in the hotel for three days with NO MONEY. The next morning Claudia informed us that our charges were unjust and she didn't think they should have to pay for it (total for four of us was $200 + tip - average drink cost at their pricey bar was $16! - that averages two drinks per person). Unjust? I think not! After arguing with her, she agreed to cover it. I told her I wanted a receipt and she informed me that I did not need one. Of course, when we returned home I found that they had indeed charged my debit card for the full amount, even before they had fully refunded our $2,000!!!! I am still awaiting a resolution for this problem. Hotel management has now decided to tell me that they are standing by the charges - basically admitting that Claudia lied to us, but being perfectly okay with that. They have the upper hand, because we gave them our credit card number - apparently if you have someone's credit card number you can charge them to the end of the Earth!
