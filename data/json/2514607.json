I know I can go out and get toothpaste on my own, but it's irritating that every day they say they'll have it for you. Even after I went out and got my own I asked them, just to see about it, and they never had it. Second, one channel consistently didn't come in clearly (NBC).

This stay was about my seventh (or sixth, or eighth; I can no longer keep track. ...!) lengthy stay (each from 8 days to 14 days in length) at this hotel since September of 2010. I have already posted at least 3 earlier reviews (all of them very positive), each for earlier stays at this hotel on this website, and, in fact, at least one or two of those earlier reviews of the hotel are no longer available on the site, because they were so old that they were rolled/scrolled into some dim and dusty archive at the Trip Advisor website! BTW, I have just noticed that Trip Advisor has reently changed the names of the categories for type of stay that reviewers are asked to pick, and under this newer classification system, each of my many stays would qualify, for Type of Stay (aka \"What Sort of Trip Was This?\"), as both Business and Solo stays. I love this hotel and, whenever I come to Manhattan for my consulting work, I always stay ONLY in this hotel. While part of my reason for staying here so faithfully and repeatedly has to do with the location, which is in lower SoHo and in close proximity to Chinatown, Little Italy, LES, and TriBeCa, the simple reality is that there are a number of good hotels available in this same area, and thus I could easily choose to stay at one of those other hotels if I wished to do so, but I find that I consistently keep coming back to this same hotel again and again. Why? I like the rooms, which are clean and comfortable, I enjoy the staff, who seem to be uniformly happy in their work and good at their jobs, I like the lobby area (which is located on the second floor), and I have never had any significant problems during ANY of my numerous and rather lengthy stays here. I finally got around to using the hotel restaurant repeatedly during this most recent stay, and I ate breakfast there on five mornings, and also ordered dinnertime meals twice from it, and in each of those cases, I found the service to be prompt and attentive, and the food to be of very high quality. I can also state with confidence that I will continue, in the future, to stay only at this hotel whenever I am in Manhattan. From this vantage point (that is, early March 2012) it now looks like my next visit to Manhattan will be a 10-day stay in late April 2012, and I will once again be booking my stay at this property!

We were on the 11th floor across from the elevators. We could hear the subway, but could not feel it, it really didn't bother us all that much. Another reviewer mentioned that Little Italy was disappointing. Well, it is only two blocks these days as China Town is taking over. The two blocks of Little Italy are great, the only disappointment is that there is not more of it. The taxi ride, with tip, to Time Square ranged from $16-$20 if you are wondering. Well, we had a great time, loved the hotel, staff, and location. Yes, the room was a bit small, but I understand this is normal in NYC.

The subway is a block away. Convenient, unless sleep is on your agenda. There were no amenities ... no shower cap, no conditioner, no stationery, no envelopes. The towels were rough as sand paper. Didn't they ever hear of Bounce Free? There was 1/4 of a small writing pad. There was also coffee and tea packets with a plug-in carafe. The coffee was undrinkable. Fearing the tea was the same I bought my own tea bags. About those paper thin walls ... that was the last thing I needed to complete my sleepless nights. The people in the next room chose to shower at 3:30 am. Why I was able to hear the shower is a mystery to me. Minor point: On arrival and departure the Bellman did not offer to help with my luggage.

The M60 goes straight through Harlem, stops at every little stop along the way, and the locals are none too happy to see travelers with luggage on their main busline.

I am about to book another trip to theSoHo/Chinatown area for March 2011, and once again, after reviewing the other hotels available in the area (a number of which are a few dollars cheaper per night), I consciously and deliberately chose this hotel. I have found the staff, including concierges, doormen, front desk personnel, managers and housekeepng staff, to be happy, relaxed and very friendly and helpful. If I could change anything at all, I would like to see slightly larger rooms, but, given that this hotel is located in Manhattan, somewhat small rooms are par for the course, and I am not complaining at all about the room size. While some folks have complained about street noise from Lafayette St., I have never found it bothersome. One other great thing about this hotel is the location -- mere steps from Chinatown, Canal Street, Grand Street, Little Italy, SoHo, Tribeca and LES, and just a half-block from a great classic diner, The Landmark Diner, where I ate breakfast almost every day (except for Saturday mornings, when I tend to head over to Joey's Aquadolcia (insanely wonderful Italian deli/restaurant) on Grand St. Overall, I feel that this is a great hotel, and I love to come back to it again on each of my trips to Manhattan.

When we got there the bags were brought out but I was told by the bell man that rather than get me a taxi, he had a town car. Turns out it was a friend of his.

This May, we booked one night there as the Best western Bowery Hanbee had no availability for that particular night so again we gave it a try, also having booked and paid for the room. We were given a small room with a small bed and only one bedside table with light (I realised this was actually a room for a disabled person).

But they did get everything straightened out, however I don\u2019t think I was their favorite customer b/c they put us in room directly next to the elevator on the 3rd floor. When we walked into our room I nearly fell back with the smell of mildew. My husband told me I was being dramatic and to be fair I have a really good sense of smell, but any mildew smell is not welcome when you are paying $200 a night. The source of the odor was the bathroom which seemed to be covered in mildew. So we kept the door closed as much as possible. I should have asked to change rooms, but we were in a rush. The bed was too soft in that creepy overused way, and our view was a air-conditioning unit. All and I would say if you can stay someplace else do\u2026 be sure to check your room and ask for a change if it smells.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cFantastic, highly reccommend!!!\u201d", "Author": "podge72", "ReviewID": "UR49909987", "Content": "I have stayed here twice altogether on two seperate trips to New York, i would reccommend this hotel to anyone!!

The only complaint that I have is that the hotel will not hold our luggage for 2 nights if we don't have a future reservation and quoted us due to liability and suggested that we stored our lugguage in Penn Station. This is a crazy suggestion as we arrived in the late evening that night and will have no time to travel to Penn Station that night as we only need to store 1 piece so that the next morning we didn't need to drag 2 pieces of luggage when we joined our 3 days 2 nights tour to Philly, Washington DC/Niagara Falls and Thousand Island. We explained that we are going to book their car service upon our return on 3rd day to Jersey City and would this change? No, SORRY, that is the reply! I found this VERY DISCRIMATING as a guest as it sounds like they will hold luggage for you if you have a future stay, otherwise, once your stay is over, SORRY, you are not my guest anymore and that is your problem! In my prior stay of hotel like Sheraton Vancouver, they willing to hold and charge you a nominal fee per night of holding . This is at least an option and being helpful to your guest and not give us a rediculous suggestion that we store at Penn Station. So, apart from this issue of not able to hold our 1 piece luggage since we have no pending reservation, which I found unappreciated as a guest as well as being an UNHELPFUL hotel meeting guest needs.

Upon arrival the hotel's Bell Service saw us being dropped off by an expensive car service and promptly mentioned to us that they have a cheaper service available @ $49, which could drop us off to JFK airport, when we'll check-out. We said okay. After about three days when we checked out, the hotel arranged its 'economical' taxi service. The driver of the car started off with the flat tire (which we realized after 2 minutes). He ignored the people on the street waving and pointing this to him. He did not pull over the car when we asked him to do so, until such time that the smoke from the tire started to come out. Then he kept driving insisting to get the tire changed from some specific shop. When the car finally stopped at the tire workshop.......some Spanish guys came and asked my whole family to come out of the car so that they can change the tire. In trying to take out the spare tire from the car our luggage was put on the road. Then one guy tricked me into the tire shop and took hold of my brief case and ran off. Incidentally, the brief case had our passports, visas, cash and valuables. Later, we realized that another car had been following us all along, that car was found parked at the tire shop and was most probably used by the gangsters to run away. By the time police came they had already fled. As family with small children, we were emotionally shaken. The bottom line is ...It was a 'set up', in which the involvement of hotel staff can not be ruled out.

When we got back home to figure out a return trip with the kids I was checking rates and all rates were ranging at the $224- low $300. I am appalled that my husband spent that kinda of money on a no frills midweek room. Upon arriving at the hotel my husband pulled over and blocked the road and let me out so that I could find out where we needed to park the car. I ran up the escalator to the front desk and was told the was a bellman below. I proceeded to head back down the escalator to look all around for a bellman. I didn't see one so I went back out to the card to tell my husband that I was looking for the bellman. He was stressing out because he was in the roadway. Then I went back into the hotel in search of the bellman. I finally found him and he gave me a claim ticket. By this point I head back outside and see that my husband has parked the car across the street. I jump in and tell him that I found the bellman. He starts to get out of the car to get our bags when I finally see the bellman on the other side of the street shaking his head. He then crosses the street and explains to us that we need to move the car to the other side of the street to the hotel loading zone which was previously full. After that we checked in to the hotel with no incident. We arrived at the room and it was a small double bed room with a bath. Nothing special. Upon departure I called for my car. I guess it is my ingnorance in dealing with the valet but when my car arrived the driver was rude to me and told me to wait. I didn't feel that the trip was a waste but felt that when I got back and saw the pricing I didn't feel like I got my moneys worth.

First, this area is a wonderful place to stay, we were at the edge of LIttle Italy, Greenwich Village and Chinatown. Now granted, this much activity is not for everybody but we loved the convenience of the location. We saw a Broadway play, went to the US Open and shopped until we dropped and only took one cab other than our airport transportation. The subway was clean and very safe. There were police everywhere and at no time did we feel in danger of any kind. That is after the evening match at the US Open didn't end until after 1am and we had to ride the subway to our hotel!!! Of course you have to be smart but where don't you these days. Back to the hotel...it was so quiet I thought I was someplace other than New York. The staff while very attentive was nearly invisible and the rooms were nicely appointed and very clean. The cleaning staff comes early which I like...but if you aren't ready they will come back later in the afternoon. I am not kidding you...I can't say enough good things about this hotel! Also...if you need a ride from the airport and don't really want to take a taxi...call my newest NY friend Geo @ [--]. We found him at the airport and what a deal!!!

Our rooms were booked at the Holiday Inn on Layfette Street near Canal Street. Upon arriving we were excited as the Hotel is located in the heart of the Chinatown/Little Italy area and near a major subway route. The lobby is on a second floor and the bellboy staff is on the first floor. They have a small unattended bar area with some computer terminals for internet use. When we got to our room on the 12th floor we noticed immediately the lack of drawer space. The beds were crammed near a closet and the bathroom was very small. Upon talking to some New Yorkers I learned the building was converted into a Hotel and that is why it was so cramped. The bed linens seemed cheap for even a Holiday Inn and constanly slipped off the bed during the night. There was some train noise because the 6, N, R lines run below. The restaurant Pacifica is just as one of the above reviewer's described. Fake eggs, Lo Mein, small Danish type rolls, sausage and broccoli.....not your average breakfast fare? Take note that the management discourages you from ordering off the menu. I was told they \"only had one cook\" working on the weekend which makes no sense. The weekend would logically be the busiest time you would think and to be constantly short staffed is not a good impression to make. Also the vouchers rewards members get are good for 7 dollars off a breakfast buffet that costs $11.25. The restaurant actually makes money off the Holiday Inn. Take note that if there are 2 people to a room you get vouchers per couple not per person and this was a surprise to my co-workers. Although, the management was helpful I could tell there was definitely a division on how each business was run. In fact, when we were dining Pacifica sent a company representative to inspect the site and very was disappointed in the way the restaurant was run.

The negative things mentioned about this Holiday Inn in the other reviews here are absolutely true. Yes, the hotel is located all the way down in Chinatown (not SoHo, so don't try to walk there like we did). The building does shake every time the subway trains pass underneath. Most of all, the guestrooms are claustrophically dollhouse-tiny . Throughout all my world travels, I've never seen a room this small -- there is no way two people can comfortably navigate in such little space, to the point where it actually becomes comical! That said, however, it would be completely unfair not to mention that the outstanding service at this hotel more than makes up for all its drawbacks. We were treated like celebrities throughout our entire stay. Everyone fussed over us, from the bellmen (who double as valet parkers), to the front desk agents, to the restaurant waitstaff and housekeepers who seemed to survey our every move (we definitely knew we weren't in SoHo because many hotel employees were indeed Chinese). Anything we might have needed was already anticipated and attended to immediately. They made us feel very important and special, and our stay was so much fun that we tipped generously all around. I've stayed in quite a few hotels in Manhattan over the years, but even in the poshest places uptown, I can't remember any experience as pleasurable as this one. The valet parking was a breeze and definitely worth the extra money. The breakfast buffet was worth it , too (they comped my child's meal). The hotel usually offers a very low rate through Travelzoo, but the front desk suggests that you call the hotel directly and they can clue you in on other ways to save. Our rate was $149, which seemed more than fair for Manhattan on a holiday weekend.

The concierge was a bit on the snooty side - we only asked her one question and then just decided to figure things out on our own - which was actually quite easy.

Our room was on the 13th floor and right by the elevator but we were never awakened by anything. To clear up the subway topic mentioned by earlier posters, YES, you can hear the subway as it does run underneath the hotel. We could hear it on the 13th floor but it quickly just became background noise - this might be a problem though on the lower floors? If we were to go back, I would request a high floor just in case. The room was very clean and no sign at all of bed bugs. A previous poster mentioned the Chinest restaurant just outside the entrance to the right of the hotel. We ate there on her recommendation and we loved it. Also, every place we ate in Little Italy was awesome. The subway entrance is just a block away and was an easy way to get around town. Cabs are plentiful and quite cheap but be careful when walking around town.

I just got back from Manhattan. I spent Aug. 5th.-7th. 2006 at the Holiday Inn downtown on Lafayette st.. I read so many mixed reviews about this hotel I was a little skeptical. If that were not enough confussion, I found two articles that blew me out of the water. One was from a man that said he stayed at the place 3 days a week for forty two weeks and did not recommend that anyone stay there. The other was from a man that asked if you ever wondered why the subway was so close \"to the hotel? His answer was that the subway runs under the hotel. He wrote that he got a free giggle everytime the subway passed. I am a 58 year old woman who was traveling with my 30 year old daughter who is a student at UAB in Birmingham, Al. It was by then too late to change the reservations. No time to research another hotel property. I drove from Mobile, Al., picked my daughter up in B'ham, then on to New York. Ladies and gentlemen, it was the time of my life! This Holiday Inn is called the Holiday Inn, \"Soho\", the Holiday Inn, \"Little Italy\", It is actually the Holiday Inn, CHINATOWN\". Located one short block from one of the busiest street in NY. Canel Street. It is not far from \"Little Italy\", and \"Soho\" but it is in Chinatown. If you do not want to go there, avoid it all together. That being said, It is a very nice hotel. I paid $197.00 a day (not including taxes or parking.) I have a 2007 Toyota Camry, and it costed $44.00 a day to park. They charge more for bigger cars. No in, and out of the parking lot. You get your car again when you leave. I booked this room by calling the number to this hotel directly. My advise is to book your own room. You get a confirmation number, and there are no suprises. The staff treated us with care, attention and respect. The TV did not work when we first arrived so we called the desk. Five minutes later the maintance person came, and plugged it in. He was friendly, and we chatted about NY. The conciergse (can't spell it) suggested we ride the open top tour bus. We gave her ten dollars each, and she gave us a slip to get our tickets, with instructions on how to do it. We paid another fourty each ($100.00 total) for the up town, downtown, \"hop on hop off\" trips , and night time tours good for 48 hours. That, my friend , was a deal. The restaurant had no red wine, and no vodka. We didn't care. There are many bars in NY. The other reviews got one thing right. The rooms are small. We had two double beds, and a bathroom. All we used the room for was to shower and sleep. The place was very clean The property is trying to save water so if you want your room made up or fresh towels call the desk. We didn't need anything but more coffee, and got it in a flash. If you come out the front door of the hotel and turn right you will find a Chinese restaurant next door. Eat there..........Soooo Good! The shopping was wonderful. 8 purses, and two wallets cost less than $200.00. Don't pay over $25.00 for ANY purse. Not over $10.00 for a wallet. Don't buy from people on the street. Stay with the shops. I wanted to stay in Chinatown. I was not disappointed with a thing. I hope this helps someone out there. Oh, I almost forgot. I didn.t feel one giggle from the subway.
