It's close to a Port Authority Bus, 42nd St- Times Square subway station, and if you drove into the city like my group, a parking garage is located on the same street as the hotel. However a staff member, Juicy, recommended a more reasonably priced parking garage that was only one street over. Speaking of the staff, the staff is excellent and always friendly! I worked with Juicy at the front desk and she gave us wonderful tips on where to park, where to eat, and navigating the subway. They also do a great job keeping the hotel rooms very clean and well stocked. The rooms are small but that didn't bother me at all because in the end what we wanted was a secure, clean place and we got that and more!

The King size bed was so comfy! We had heating and air conditioning in room however didn't need to use this at all as the room was a perfect temperature!

The hotel is very small, next to it is the Hampton Inn and Candlewood Suite. Holiday Inn is managed by Hersha Hospitality and Candlewood is part of the InterContential Hotels Group. Picture the hotel as a square. As you enter, the front desk is on the left. Some lounge chairs/sofas. Concierge desk + GM\u2019s office are on the right. There a computer/printer station, two elevators, stairs, beverage area and then the breakfast room. Complimentary continental breakfast included for all! There are 36 floors. Ice + Vending are on floors: 8, 17, 25, 35. There are six rooms per floor. Rooms ending in \u201c03\u201d and \u201c04\u201d are near the elevator. See pictures above. If you were to enter the hotel- on the left side is the view of the Hudson (?) river. The right might be the view of the Empire Building. The checks in time are discrepant: the actual check in time is 4pm. The emergency exit sign behind the room\u2019s door state that it\u2019s 3pm. We were on the 25th floor-a non smoking floor, but we can smell the cigarette smoke in the hallway. It might be because it\u2019s travelling thru the vents. I\u2019ve email management for special requests: early arrival, high floor, a room with a view and it was ALL honored during our New Year Eve stay! I\u2019m just a little disappointed that they never acknowledge that they received my email. Since we\u2019re part of their loyalty program, we received chocolates, water bottles and the staff surprised us with a birthday card and candies. Holiday Inn is a brand you can trust. They have all the amenities you would normally expected-TV, closet, soap/shampoo/lotion, towels, coffee makers, safes are at the front desk. Parking is available for a fee. Complimentary Wifi available throughout the building. I hope you haven\u2019t jump into conclusion about my title regarding bed bugs! There are absolutely NO bed bugs during our stay.

I stayed mid February 2012. Firstly I want to thank the wonderful staff. From the front desk to cleaning staff everyone was pleasant, friendly and helpful. All would give a warm smile, say hello and take interest in you -a lovely touch. They were very knowledgeable and helpful which was great as it was my first time to NY. A few great extra touches that I wasn't aware of; I had a room only rate but was pleasantly surprised to find complimentary breakfast for ALL guests every morning. Consisted of juices, tea, coffee, bagels, pastries, bacon and omlettes. A complimentary all day coffee and tea bar with take away cups and lids was very handy and I would take one every day I ventured out to experience the city. The hotel also provides for fast and free wifi. There is no laundry however you have free use of the laundry (washers and dryers) of the candle wood hotel which is right next door. They sell powder for $1. There is no restaurant for lunch of dinner however there are vending machines on some floors with snacks and sodas and water and ice. The location is fantastic! Easy walking to Times Square. The hotel is surrounded by restaurants, cafes and all the action of NY. Of course being in the heart of NY the room is not huge but it is comfortable, clean, light and appealing. Bathroom is a good size, clean and has basic shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer and hair dryer. The room is serviced daily and kept well. This hotel is great for those that are interested in exploring all that NY has to offer and then come home to a comfortable, clean room.

We were based on the 30th floor and had no issues or problems with getting up and down with the lift. We found breakfast to be tasty and plentiful with a vast selection. We had made a decision that if the breakfast was not up to much we would dine out. However the breakfast exceeded our expectations. In addition there was complimentary tea and coffee and fruit juices avaliable at anytime of the day which was handy. It saved havibg to use the coffee maker in the room. I had read about warm cookies avaliable and can confirm that these cookies were in reception during the early evening and were truly lovely. The hotel is situated between 7th and 8th Avenue and gave plenty of choice for dining. We didn't like time square in the evening as the restaurants were busy and it was mass produced convenience fast food. However just by the hotel is an area called hells kitchen which has numerous restaurants to try out. We tried several and each were as good as each other. On the day we checked out to return back to the uk we were given the choice of keeping our room for longer or havibg our luggage looked after which allowed us to have an extra day in new York before our flight home. The hotel arranged our transport back to JFK and it made a lovely surprise to be greeted and taken back to the airport in a limo. My husband and I would definitely stay with the holiday inn express if we go back to new York but more importantly we will now consider this chain of hotel in other destinations.

Amazing fish tacos, ribs, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and cornbread! About a 10 minute walk from the hotel up on 45th or so? Can't remember the exact cross street. Five Napkin Burger is also on 9th, was too busy when we tried to go there. Pinkberry is also on 9th Avenue...fantastic frozen yogurt! Shake Shack was on 8th Avenue on 41st Street or so?

Breakfast was free - pancake maker, juice, coffee, milk, yogurt, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, muffins, bagels, toast...couldn't complain. It was always busy, but was fine. Front desk was friendly, they had a concierge that answered all our questions. Safe deposit boxes were located at the front desk if needed. They accomodated our late check-out and stored our luggage when we arrived cuz our room was not available yet. Only two elevators and there were definitely peak busy times where it took a little longer, but overall, that was fine also.

Located one block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and three blocks from the array of restaurants and entertainment venues on 42nd Street, this hotel is a great value and is within an easy five minute walk of Times Square. While the room itself was compact, it wasn't too small, and considering the pricing at other hotels that may have had bigger rooms, it was fine. One doesn't come to NYC to sit in the hotel room anyways ! The complimentary breakfast on the main floor was plentiful, and there were always at least three or four staff refreshing the supplies and cleaning and straightening up the breakfast bar, and chatting with the guests to ensure that they didn't need anything. The pancake machine was a big hit, not only as a novelty, but as a food source. If you come down for breakfast within the last 30 minutes, yes, you may have a hard time finding a seat, as other posters have said. I came down for breakfast each day at about 8 am and at least half the seats were empty at that time. There is a business center in the lobby with two computers and a printer, that can be used by the hotel guests. The hotel also has wired and wireless internet in the rooms. The hotel has only two elevators, but that only seemed to be a slight inconvenience at breakfast time - it did sometimes take 5 minutes to get an elevator at 8 am, but once there, the elevators were very fast. The hotel is very tall and very skinny. Seriously, I think the hotel itself is probably only 50 feet wide. On my floor, I think there were only six or seven rooms. The hotel appears to be almost new, I would guess about 2 years old. If you are leaving the hotel and taking a cab, I would suggest that you walk down to the corner, to catch a cab, as opposed to catching it right in front of the hotel. Unfortunately delivery trucks etc. sometimes temporarilly blocked 39th St, meaning that you sit in a cab with the meter running, not going anywhere. (That happened to me twice - nothing to do with the hotel, just a suggestion to save you money.) The hotel manager could be seen each morning visiting with guests in the breakfast area, checking to make sure the stay was enjoyable. The manager was very friendly and it is obvious that he and his staff truly do care about their guests - I travel a great deal for work (92 nights last year), and it was refreshing to experience a hotel with that much hospitality and care about their patrons.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cDoes all you want for the price\u201d", "Author": "tomgem_lond", "ReviewID": "UR121590072", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel for 5 days, and had no problems at all.

We even walked down 25 flights of stairs a few times to avoid the wait. Charlene on the reception desk was very unwelcoming throughout our stay and even gave the wrong computer code to us on the phone. There are comments on here about the plastic cups in the room not being replaced each day, the door to our room had to be forced open by my husband and the bathroom door did not close easily at all. The airconditioning was very old and noisy. These are not new comments, others have remarked about this too. I wonder why people are giving it such good ratings, have they really stayed here? This is not my first trip to NY, we are frequent travellers and I don't like to run places down but the comments I put are true and I am not the first.

You have to walk up the street even to catch a cab. I would not have let my granddaughter out of my sight for anything. From now--it is better not to go at such a crowded time- We spent a fortune catching cabs back from musicals----probably staying on Broadway or much closer to main streets would have evened out given the fees paid in cab fares- Last night it poured and we were stuck quite far away having to walk back.

However, i don't find any problem at all during my stay. I can say that the General Manager doing his job wonderful. The elevator is fast during breakfast time (7-9 am) i don't wait long for the elevator. The breakfast area though is small but i think its adequate as people leaves once they finish their breakfast. i never have problem finding a table for my family during peak hour (bf time). The 2 rooms that I stayed is both at 18th floor and very clean. The good thing, we did not hear any noise at night as our floor did not have any vending machine. The bed is very good (firmed). One thing that surprised me is that u will always find hot coffee, tea and sodas on the GF (Amazing). During breakfast, the variety of foods are excellent and they always put in more foods once the basket are empty.

There was an Italian restaurant just across the hotel which served very good food and was recommended by Lonely Planet. Also a sandwich bar just around the corner for quick bites. There are a lot of restaurants near the hotel for diverse choices. It is quite a walk to Times Square though but location wise, it still gives you value for money. Only problem we encountered with the hotel was that the elevator would get quite full during the breakfast rush, we would just sometimes use the stairs because the 2 lifts would not be enough to accommodate all the guests.

The Circle Line boat dock and the Intrepid Air and Space Museum is also an easy walk to the river. Three blocks over and five blocks up. Cabs are plentiful and inexpensive. The hotel has 35 floors and only six rooms per floor. It is very tall and thin. The rooms are rather small but still comfortable. We had two adults and two teens and managed just fine. Room is missing a safe, which would be nice. Bathroom is great and no problems there. Night noise is very little and sleep comfort was good. We could see the Empire State Building from our window. The staff are great and answered any questions we had and called around for reservations and offered tips and suggestions readily. The breakfast room was always fully stocked and very clean albeit a bit small but we always got a table. The staff there were always bringing in fresh food. Lots to eat and a decent selection of hot and cold items. Being very tall and only six rooms per floor the elevator could get a little busy and was crowded, but that was minimal.

Staff were friendly, when we requested more towels the front desk called few mins later to confirm whether they had arrived yet. The bad: Room is small and it was a bit of a tight squeeze for three of us, particularly after we had done some shopping! Bathroom was clean but little space to put our toiletries, however we worked around this so it was fine. The room was equipped with an iron and hairdryer - however when we contacted the hotel prior to travelling we were told they didn't provide them so ended up taking both with us. On the last day we asked for a set of scales so we could weigh our luggage - lots of shopping im afraid!

The good things: comfortable beds, clean rooms, friendly staff, breakfast, location. The not so good things: impossible to get a lift in the morning (we walked the stairs), the scramble for seats in the small dining room at breakfast. However, at all costs avoid any floor with vending or ice machines ! Directly outside our room the vending m/c made a loud noise all night and the ice machine is used at all hours (even 4am!) and the noise the machine and the drunks using them made woke us up every night.

The only negative comment I could make is not the hotel's fault, there is a big construction project across the street that start at 7AM, it woke me up 2 times. There are probably 5 hotels that are close to the construction, so everyone is being affected. I wish the construction started at 8AM.

Yes, it is busy if you leave it until 9:15 to eat breakfast but the hotel cannot be blamed for it being busy at this time (as other reviews have suggested). Tea, coffee and fresh juice is also available throughout the day. Wifi is free throughout your stay along with two desktop PCs in the lobby which are also free to use and print from. Both are extremely useful and other hotels I stayed at were looking to charge $5 for half an hours use.

Not too familiar with NYC, I was relatively unsure what to expect with the hotel and it's location. Building up to the trip I had several email communications with Hassan (Front Desk) & Hunter (GM) regarding room reservations, dates, and bed types. They were both extremely accomodating and punctual in their responses which made the planning a very easy process. With our friends flying in from England to surprise my wife I was nervous that the surprise would be ruined upon check in, however, the Front Desk girls on duty were well aware of my situation (credit to Hassan/Hunter) and were extremely discreet. Our rooms were perfect - clean, modern and comfortable. The hotel staff that we encountered were very friendly - breakfast crew, Front Desk and housekeepers. Not expecting much from the complimentary breakfast I was surprised by the choice on offer: bacon, sausage patties/links, scrambled eggs, omelets, breads, bagels, cereals, pastries and fruit. This was perfect for our group to gather in the AM and plan the days events on a full stomach. I was even more impressed with the all day fruit juice fountain machine and selection of teas/coffees that were available to guests at any time - a welcome amenity after a long day exploring the city in the cold weather. The hotel was about $35 away from LaGuardia in a cab including tolls and gratuity. The Concierge arranged our transfer back to the airport for $20 each sharing a shuttle with another couple. I would definitely recommend this to other couples as some of the cab drivers refuse to go to the airport at certain parts of the day (4pm shift change in our case). The hotel's location on 39th street was ideal. A 5-10 minute pleasant walk to Times Square attractions. Subways to all the Manhattan areas were not far (even in the cold weather) - alternatively for groups of 4 or more, cabs are a lot easier for relatively the same price as the subway. Around the hotel there were also tons of restaurants, bars, take outs especially on 8th & 9th avenue. We had a wonderful time in NYC and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Holiday Inn Express Times Square. Definitely would return to this hotel for future stays. Thanks again.

Since $45 was around what I was expecting to pay in total for the cab and I confirmed with him THREE times that this was a flat rate, I agreed.

They also have two computers & 1 printer in the lobby that we did use to check into our flight & print our boarding passes. The FREE continental breakfast was actually more than just a danish. They had bagels, yougurt, eggs, biscuts, fruit, yougurt & more. An outdoor enclosed patio was opened that morning to accomodate the breakfast goers with tables and chairs, nice. We check out early the next day and they held our bags again. I truly enjoed my stay there. I paid half the price that I did last year for another hotel and it was in bad condition. This one seems like its taylored for the business traveler, but it worked for us since we just needed a place for a night.

Best of all, my two favorite amenities: a free, well stocked breakfast, and free high speed wifi. Here's what is less than perfect: small rooms, hardly any shelf space in the bathroom, and it's not really at Times Square but a half mile walk past the bus terminal and down a rather grungy street. But I'd walk that walk any day for the user-friendly amenities at this hotel. I notice comments about the elevators. I stayed on the 34th floor and never had to wait more than 30 seconds for an elevator. The building is interesting - apparently it contains 3 tall and thin hotels side by side, which is why there are only 6 rooms to a floor, and why - at least for my stay - 2 elevators can do the job in a 36 floor hotel. As for value, I had a great rate from a discount website, and if the Holiday Inn's rack rates were twice that price, it would get 5 stars for value. Unfortunately, they are considerably more.

The hotel is very new and clean. The beds are comfortable, it seemed to be very quiet, and the complimentary breakfast was wonderful (and a cost saver in NY). There was also free wireless internet which was nice. For us, the location worked, however, we also like to walk a lot - I could see where some others may not like the location. It is very close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, and the bus depot. There are also plenty of restaurants and shops in the area. However, it is a little misleading to call it the Holiday Inn Express \"Times Square\" as it is not in Times Square but actually quite a few blocks over. (We actually ended up being thankful for this though b/c I think that is why it was quiet there.) That being said, you can walk to Times Square and the theater district in about 10 minutes, or to Central Park in about 20/30 minutes. So it really depends on how much you want to walk (or take public transportation). Other than that, my only complaints would be small ones - the room was smaller (but that is kind of expected in NYC), and it was hard to regulate the temperature both on the thermostat and in the shower. The hotel itself was pretty small - only about six rooms on each floor - but very tall (about 40 floors).

New York is a city re-visited after 32 years. I read the latest 10 reviews before I write so as to keep a more impartial view on my experiences and those vacationers'. The hotel should acknowledge that the front staff fail to give a consistent and regular hospitality service to all at different time and days. I had both carrot and stick in my four night stays. While Roger impresses me with his prompt and casual and easy going manner, some are still keeping a busy, don't-care-less attitude. The A/C system is the best of all amenities. The lighting cannot provide good night reading condition though I admit that westerners would prefer romance to practicality. Toiletry is sufficient for daily use save the absence of glass for rinsing. Those plastic cups are too small. We cannot complain too much about the elevators. This building may not be for hotel accommodation in its primary construction, and nothing the hotel can do to speed up lifting. Without space for another service lift, both staff and guests should pardon each other for inconvenience and mess. If not, the best solution is to demolish it. By the way, this is HI Express. I know what I would get, and I would where the location should be by the name. In my home city, the HI Express is housed in a brand new building for 2-3 star accommodation for back-packers, tours, family holiday-makers and solo visitor like me, adjacent to Times Square, a shopping magnet for all tourists and the local. But this is New York. I believe I get the best value with what I pay though I do have complaints. The continental breakfast is not 'continental'. It is quite 'New York', providing choices of food and varities close to a full breakfast. And it is complimentary! Try those continental breakfasts in Europe and the UK, and you understand why I am so grateful to what I can eat for my breakfast. The hotel even provides instant oatmeal in addition to cornflakes of three kinds and chilled yogurt. So, give concession to crowdiness. Provide spacing for each other. Be less selfish and less dominant. I saw a lady not giving way to a long queue unless she finished toasting ten slices of bread and two English muffins using the one-and-only-one toaster for 4 slices at a time. (why only one? I scratch my head to work out a reason) Yes, about something missing: I also lost my sachet of bath treatment the next day. The maid might have considered this a trash, but the sachet is unopen in its original packaging, and it should not be mistaken as an abandoned object. I wrote a very polite memo to advise the maid to return it to me, in case they found it somewhere. The note was on the table unattended. English? They may understand English, but can they communicate with guests well? I spent usually one hour in the quiet late morning to check and send e-mail, in the 'business centre' next to the staff laundry room, and I had not heard a word in English every time I was there. All staff there speak their own native language in a joyful, reckless and care-free manner which I hope I can have a share. I understand that the basement is their territory, but it is a space in New York, and their working time should not be taken for granted as their own free time.

TIPS ABOUT NYC: I took the Super Shuttle from JFK in to the city. NEVER again! From the time that I landed until I reached the door of the hotel...4 hours! A taxi with the $45.00 flat fee is the way to go if time is valuable to you while in NYC. I had great difficulty getting a cab back to the room and to JFK. Literally 5 cabs wouldn't take me back to the room (not because I'm sketchy or smell bad either! :-)). They wouldn't take me because the fare would have been to low. However at midnight after a day of walking and being alone I wanted to take a cab, COULDN'T get one off the street. I did go the the Marriot Marquis in Times Square where they have a cab line. It was only then that I was able to get back. The subway is the way to travel, in my opinion, while in NYC. It was FULL of tourists and some locals and was VERY safe. I got to WTC in 10 minutes, back to shopping on Canal St in 3, back to Times Square in 4. All for $2.75. If you are going to WTC there are two different commemorative sites. One a museum and the other a small gift shop type place. St. Pauls Church accross the street is chock full of history (George Washingtons Pew for example) and also has a lot of 9-11 rememberances. Within Times Square is an old converted theater dedicated to Times Square called the \"Times Square Guild? Consortium?\" They were very informative and offer Broadway shows at face value. TKTS TKTS booth does not sell tickets to Jersey Boys. It sells out every night. INCREDIBLE show. A must see and not a bad seat in the place.

Staff on check in were very pleasant and helpful. Had requested a room on high floor with a view and that is exactly what we got. Room on 34th Floor with views of the Empire State Building one way and the Hudson River the other. The rooms are not large but perfectly fine for a short stay. King size bed was so comfortable and had both soft and firm pillows. Well equipped with wardrobe and plenty of drawer space and 32 inch flat screen tv on wall. It also had air conditioning that you could control yourself. Coffee maker and coffee/tea/sugar/milk also supplied. Room was very clean. Bathroom was small but had a bathtub with shower over and some supplied toiletries. Very nice large fluffy white towels. Price included breakfast which consisted of juice, cereals, yogurts, pastries, bagels, toast etc. Also on some days boiled/scrambled eggs or omelets and beefburgers, as much tea/coffee as you like, which we found perfectly acceptable. It is only a small breakfast room and it does get crowded, but we were down by 8.30 each day and never had a problem. I have read reports on Trip Advisor of long waits for the lift and yes, there are only two lifts and there are only 6 rooms per floor and 36 floors. Whether we just lucky, I don't know, but we never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift at any time. Downstairs in reception there is a small lounge area and complimentry tea and coffee are available 24hours a day. Also in the afternoon/early evening there was a large bowl of lovely apples on the reception desk for you to help yourself. There is a luggage storage area which is handy if you have a later flight out. There are two computers to use at no charge, and a printer. Ideal for printing out boarding passes. The street that the hotel is in is a bit dark and dreary and there is s certain amount of construction work going on, but felt quite safe there even at night. You can be on 8th Avenue in less than a minute and about 5 minutes walk to Times Square area. Staff were always ready to help and answer questions for you.

We had called and were told that there was parking for $50 a night. Not bad by NYC standards. On our first call we were told that we could drop off the car and they would park it in an off site lot. Then we were told when we got there that we would have to drop it off at IMPARK lot 5 min away and walk. Weather was nice but u might want to call and see if it was just us misunderstanding or a bad policy. So if your looking to save a couple hundred dollars a night, stay in a nice clean hotel that's close to TS then this is it. If your looking to stay in TS and like to spend $450 or more for a room to sleep in then pass on this.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cClean but small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Oznar", "ReviewID": "UR43317895", "Content": "Hotel is located close to Port Authority bus terminal, times square, empire state.
