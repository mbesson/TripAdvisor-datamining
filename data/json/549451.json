I'm sure that many of my findings were stated somewhere on Westgate's (or TripAdvisor's) website, but I didn't bother to look. Here are some things that might be helpful for guests. The activities cost. I was under the assumption that the tie-dyeing tee-shirts and making bird houses were included in the cost. Bring laundry detergent. My room only had one small packet and that's not enough when you have several people in a room staying a week. Bring your own dish-washing detergent. Yep, there was only enough in our room for one load and our pots/pans were not non-stick. There's no free WiFi. I was extremely disappointed to learn internet service was $10 a day AND that only one person could be on one device in the room at the same time. There's no recycling....at least none that I saw. Who doesn't recycle in this day and age?! Given all these things I wish I would have known ahead of time, I was extremely impressed with the place. The fact that there is a washer/dryer in the room was awesome! It was extremely clean and well-kept. I thought the location was good, too.

We waited awhile but really needed to get settled, so we proceeded without concierge, thinking that we'd have had a visit within hours with our \"welcome packet\". This didn't happen until two days later, at 9 am, while we were still sleeping in. He promised to return that evening. We stayed and left without our \"welcome packet\" (which does contain one or two items of value). The closet and rear patio could have been vacuumed, and the a/c could respond better to instructions. These properties look NOTHING like they did when we purchased our week - with one or two exceptions, they are generally FAR from the luxury we are promised. This two-floor \"grand\" villa (1 br) required a trek upstairs for any toilet use or any look in a mirror. The general cleaning promised mid-week was an exercise of sloppiness. The bed was made, the trash thrown out, but we had to call housekeeping back to clean the vanity and whirlpool and vacuum the floors. The two who came did the latter and refused the other tasks because \"that was not their job\"! A little talk with a supervisor who visited rectified that nonsense the following day. Even when cleaned, the dullness of the whirlpool was no invitation to us to place our behinds in there. Indeed, this was not cleaned to the best quality even BEFORE we arrived; what I had thought was simply ageing grout turned out to be, for a 7\" section at the top of the tub, dirt - mold that i could easily remove with toilet tissue. Shame! This was rendered a little better after the midweek cleaning. The bed might have been a bit more comfortable (softer) but at least the pillows were clean, and not a repeat of a previous stay at one of their other locations when we had a pillow that reeked of somebody's urine. I found the exercise room to be shabby; I found it ridiculous that in this age, in what is touted as a luxury hotel, the TVs in the room are old tubes, and neither of them was even 32\". You would think that people do not pay maintenance fees and taxes on these properties! Shame!!! The transmission and picture on the one premium channel (HBO) was horrible on both TVs.

There are 1 and 2 bedrooms and even rooms that open up enough to hold up to 10 people. I fell in love with the 2 bedroom deluxe. One of the bedrooms is upstairs and one downstairs and such a large living/dining area and full kitchen. Some of the cabins and nicer rooms do tend to fill up fast so plan ahead.

Building 1000 (the main building) is the best. Everything was very clean and updated. Also, the pool area is great and it was right across from Building 1000. A few complaints that kept me from rating this property excellent: WiFi costs $9.99 per day PER DEVICE. Terrible arrangement -- every podunk motel anywhere else offers free WiFi. Can you do without WiFi? Of course, but evening Netflicks on iPads for the kiddos and if you own a business and need to stay in touch in the evenings can get pricey. Also, the check in/check out times are very inconvenient (4 pm check in and 10 am check out). Really cuts into your weekend when you can't check in until 4pm on Friday and have to be out by 10am on Sunday.

Also, there was no hot tub! We went back up to the office to point out their mistake and the desk clerk informed us that it was not a mistake. We booked a cabin with a hot tub and we showed them our printout again from booking our cabin online. We asked to speak with the manager about this because our printout clearly showed we booked a cabin with a hot tub, not a small hotel room on the 4th floor. The Manager told us that the amount we paid online at their site was not enough to rent a cabin for the weekend because we didn't pay the \"Cabin Price\". We then decided we wanted a refund to which we were told \"You can go someplace else if you like but there will be NO REFUND\". They offered us a larger room on the 1st floor (still with no hot tub) but that was the best they would do, \"Take it or leave it\". So if there is someone out there thinking about staying at Westgate Branson Woods and think you are getting a cabin with a hot tub then I suggest you think again because it doesn't matter what your paperwork says and there will be NO REFUND!

Though we are owners here, we hadn\u2019t been to Branson for several years, and had become kind of concerned about what was happening at the resort based on some of the comments recently made. Because I know that some people will complain no matter what, I took the bad reviews with a grain of salt determined to see for myself. I needn\u2019t have worried! Branson Woods was better than ever! My husband and I drove down from Minnesota, about a 10 hour drive, and our daughter, son-in-law, and kids, ages 9, 6, and almost 5 drove up from Texas \u2013 just a bit short of a 10 hour drive. We arrived shortly after 4:00 p.m. and waited maybe 5 minutes in line to check in. The older gentleman that checked us in was friendly and efficient. We had reserved one of the loft style units with one bedroom and bath on the main floor and another bedroom and bath upstairs. Both bedrooms have King beds, and there is also a Queen sleeper sofa in the living room. The unit was spacious with plenty of room around the dining table to seat everyone. The kitchen is very well equipped, and has more cabinet space than many have at home. The downstairs bathroom is large with double sinks, large counter area and many cabinets and drawers. We first discovered that one of the sinks in the downstairs bathroom had a broken faucet controller. My husband, who always travels with tools, tried to repair it but realized that a new part was needed. When realizing that the one sink was inoperable, we tried the other sink and found the drain slow. They have a new motto about if you have a problem, call 1 2 3 4 and consider it done. They mean it! Within about ten minutes a maintenance man appeared and took care of the issues with both sinks! The next day we realized that part of the screening on the screened in porch had pulled out and that the canopy for the overhead light/fan on the porch was hanging down \u2013 not a functional issue, but not a good thing to have the wires exposed in case of storm with driving rain. We also found that the toaster in the kitchen didn\u2019t work. We brought the one from the downstairs bedroom (which is actually a studio unit with microwave, small fridge, dishes, etc.) into the kitchen and it worked fine, but decided to report the non working one, so that the next person would have working appliances. We called 1 2 3 4 and within minutes a very friendly guy brought us a new toaster, still in the box and took away the one that didn\u2019t work. Right after that a technician arrived and fixed the screen and the light. It turns out that you can call the same number for any need or question, whether you need to know something about the resort, or you need more toilet paper, towels, or shampoo. You not only get service, but friendly service with a smile! We were located not far from the Overlook Pool and the kids loved going there. During the week we also got up to the clubhouse and they swam in the large outdoor pool and the indoor pool. At one point though \u2013 both the Overlook Pool and the Main outdoor Pool were closed for cleaning as \u201csomeone had an accident\u201d. I assume that there was a situation with a small child and not having them attired properly. I think it would be a good thing for Westgate to install a large sign saying \u201cCHILDREN NOT POTTY TRAINED MUST WEAR SWIMMEES OR RUBBER PANTS TO PROTECT OTHERS\u201d. The pools were cleaned and opened in a couple of days. Of course the reason you go to Branson is for the shows and entertainment and as always, we loved everything we saw. It was the first time there for our daughter and her family, and they didn\u2019t know what to expect \u2013 they loved everything. We all attended the Hamner-Barber Show, Dixie Stampede, and the unbelievably fabulous Noah, the Musical. They also went to the Chinese Acrobats, the Legend of Kung Fu (the found it fantastic and also had the dinner served there and all loved it) and Silver Dollar City. We went to see George Dyer, who does morning shows at the Dutten Theater, man with an amazing voice after hearing him sing at the resort during the dinner Tuesday night. Noah is truly amazing, and there is a backstage tour that you can take, that requires only a reservation, no additional money. They use many live animals, and the animals all live down stairs in this huge building. Some of the animals used in the Ark are mechanical and others are costumed people, but there are live camels, horses, dogs, pigs, ducks, cattle, llamas, amazing Scottish cattle that look a lot like Water Buffalo (I love Water Buffalo!). It is truly an extravaganza performance and made even more interesting to get a glimpse backstage! I would recommend this show to everyone! Something that we found greatly improved since our last visit was the Tuesday evening dinner at the resort, where many performers from various shows come and give a sample of their talents. They have a new building with a stage and lots of chairs and long tables. It used to be held downstairs in the Clubhouse and space was limited. It was cheaper, but the food was nothing to brag about. The cost was $10 for adults, $6 for kids, and under 5 free. We made a point of getting there early enough to get at a table in the front so that the kids could easily see what was going on. Dinner was good and all you could eat and included, salad and fixings, potatoes, veggies, rolls, chicken, pulled pork, and assorted cobbler desserts. Unlimited coffee, iced tea and soft drinks were included. The entertainment included parts of maybe 12 different shows, and it was a very entertaining evening! Door prizes were given out and they had a certificate for a \u201cMake a Bear\u201d (one of their offered activities for kids) and my 4 year old granddaughter won it and loved the whole experience! Though they had many kids activities throughout the week, we were too busy with other things to participate in any of them. We found all the employees to be helpful and cheerful, the unit very well equipped and clean and the grounds beautifully landscaped and cared for. I am thinking that the people who did all the complaining must have paid to stay in one of the four buildings that have \u201cmotel like\u201d units but expected to be housed in luxury villas for the same cost. Of course the scenery is beautiful, and resort conveniently located near to most everything!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "KC", "Title": "\u201cAwesome facility at a reasonable price\u201d", "Author": "DOS_54", "ReviewID": "UR118029142", "Content": "Took the family for a quick 3 day vacation at Westgate over the summer and everybody had a great time.

The only reason I did not move to another hotel is because I had family members coming from 5 different states and I could not contact them at the last minute. The Group sales were not people friendly. After I signed the contract booking my group event, I was not able to talk to the Gp mananger again. My phone calls were not answered or returned. I was on my own when I arrived at the resort trying to find the banquet room that my group activities were scheduled for on Friday and Saturday night. I have been booking my family reunions for the last 15 years, this was my worst experience. Every other place the Group sales keep in contact with me plan and execute all my group needs. They personally meet me upon my arrival to make sure that all is well and that I have everything I need. The staff at Branson Woods, did not care how my stay was nor did they care if my group meeting rooms were acceptable. The room we had for Friday night Meet and Greet was good. However, the room we had on Saturday night was a night mare. We were promised a large glass enclosed room down by the pool. What we got was a Game room that was beihg used by the general public. The general public was constantly interrupting us, the room was not set-up nor was it clean. There were games on the table the carpet was stained. We had to clean up the room ourselves. There was no one from the resort staff to assist us. There was one person there, but he was there to rip up carpet and replace it. He was not aware of a function being held that night. This facility really need to be downgraded to 2 Stars or less.

Despite the fact that the weather was nasty due to storms associated with that weather system and others in the days we were there, we had a wonderful time in a cozy, well-equipped cabin. We had secured the cabin in a silent auction and we were, frankly, quite apprehensive as we arrived for our stay. In the weeks leading up to the trip, as we sought to finalize our arrangements, we had encountered a number of headaches caused by confusion on the part of the resort management. Within minutes of our arrival at the lovely Registration building in the heart of the resort, we became even more anxious when it appeared that there was still more confusion over the precise type of accommodations we had secured through our auction bid. Fortunately, this initial problem was quickly resolved and from that point forward we encountered no other troublesome issues. The resort itself is a secure, gated community within minutes of everything Branson offers to the visitor. There are several types of accommodations available on the site ranging from fairly typical hotel type rooms, to condominiums, to cabins of various sizes. Our cabin was a two bedroom unit with a fireplace, a dining area, a well equipped kitchen (and a smaller kitchenette in the second bedroom), two very large baths with showers and large, garden-whirlpool tubs, a large living area with two leather couches and a comfortable overstuffed chair, and two large side and rear decks with seating and dining furnishings. The \"master\" bedroom was nicely furnished with a queen sized bed, a dresser, a television (there were three total in the cabin), end tables and a sitting bench. The second bedroom was more crowded with a small kitchenette (this bedroom and it's adjoining bath can be locked off from the rest of the cabin constituting a small studio unit, thus the kitchenette). Overall, the furnishings, and appliances (small kitchen appliances and a washer/dryer stack unit) were comparable to those found in other nice vacation condo units you may have visited. The cabin was quaint in appearance and nestled below the level of the drive approaching it, on a hillside with a small babbling brook running along it's border (one evening near sunset we watched two small red foxes playing around and in that brook). Guests may access a number of commons areas including a recreation room (including an exercise area), a business center, a large dining hall (where week-long stayers are offered one night of entertainment and a buffet for a small additional cost, well worth it), and a much too small room where a breakfast buffet may be purchased daily (this we skipped, preferring to prepare our own breakfast in our cabin). Outdoors, there are walking trails, basketball and shuffleboard courts, and pools (there is also an indoor pool). All requests for any sort of attention were met promptly and courteously during our stay. Our cabin provided us a very nice spot to relax, nap, read, and luxuriate (in the whrlpool bath!) when not doing the touristy stuff that is plentiful in the area. I will not review Branson itself since such reviews are ubiquitous and easily discovered by the curious. Based on our experience, I would recommend the resort, and in particular the cabins, with confidence to any who may desire such accommodations in the Branson/Ozarks area. My only caution would be that you may encounter some snafus with the previsit arrangements of your accommodations, as we did.

We all had to stand in line no less than 30 minutes to check in, get our keys, etc. Everyone staying at the resort had to go through this line. So off to a bad start. When we go to our reserved cabins, they were not what my mom and aunts had toured. They had been shown their top of the line, most recent condo's during the tour. These Condo's (called the Falls) are absolutely amazing, very luxurious, the beds are incredible, furnishings lovely... you get my drift. However, that is not where we were placed. Our cabins were older, not luxurious, by any stretch of the imagination. However, I thought they were fine. The difficult part about this was that part of our group was scattered around the resort. It seems that whoever booked 2 bedroom cabins were placed in the older models, and anyone that chose a 3 or 4 bedroom cabin were placed in the \"falls\" condos. Sooo, most every evening we would all congregate up to the Falls to meet and have dinner. You can also have Breakfast included in your stay, and they will supply you with vouchers, and then you go to a certain room where your breakfast is served. The breakfast was NOT good. First, the room that is designated for you to go for your breakfast buffet is simply not an adequate size to accomodate the amount of people that show up. The eggs didn't even seem real, it was just not appetizing. After the first day, none of us went back for breakfast the remaining 3 days. All in all, we still had a good time. However, upon making your reservations, I highly recommend that you request the \"condos at the Falls\", if you want to really enjoy your time there.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cStarted off a little wrong but quickly became a wonderful trip\u201d", "Author": "Tracey1223", "ReviewID": "UR82203886", "Content": "When I booked this trip on line I called what I thought was the reservation desk at the resort to confirm all the details of our stay.

Finally my14yr old son says Mom the door to our cabin is down here. In the basement under another cabin. Yes it was a log cabin but in the basement. Only one bedroom had a jacquzzi and there was no fireplace. I paid extra for the log cabin stand alone when I booked this. The excuse was that I didn't specifiy when I booked my reservation. I told them I even called the resort several times because I was trying to upgrade to a three bedroom cabin. The number I called was in florida. No notes were sent to them. It took them about 30 minutes to finish cleaning the other cabin and they made it right. The resort is extremely nice. The indoor pool, hot tubs, shuffle board, weight room etc. was great. My kids(my 14 yrs and my 25 yr old son and his wife) loved the place. They had there own suite seperate from my husband and I and the 14 yr old had the hide a bed in the living room. Cabin was great. Not perfect.

Also, maybe they could install a little bigger shower so that you aren't hitting the walls with your elbows while trying to shower.

Maybe if you stayed in a non smoking hotel room it would be better, I don't know. The in room coffee tasted like dirt and the creamer was so old it was rock hard. There were several things wrong in the room such as non working lights, no iron, no tissues etc... Now for the great part... the cabin was awesome! They are beautiful, well cleaned and smell nice too. We felt like we were in a home instead of a room. We were given a two bedroom cabin when we switched for a one bedroom price because that was the first one available. The bedrooms both had a huge bathroom with jacuzzi's in them and they were situated on opposite sides of the cabin with closing doors for privacy. These would be great to share with another couple. The kitchens were well stocked with anything you could think of such as dishes, silverware, pots and pans, and even lots of gadgets you wouldn't think of. Off of the kitchen are sliding glass doors leading out to a huge deck with table and chairs. Our cabin was in the woods and it was so peaceful you wouldn't know that the busy Branson streets were just right outside the resort gates. The resort grounds are beautiful and the pool is nice and has two hot tubs as well.

We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. The one minor issue we had, they showed up within 10 minutes after making the call. Check-in also went well. We arrived early and they made every effort to get one unit ready for us as soon as they could. They also accomodated our request to be placed in the pond and fountain area. One thing that had me concerned before we arrived was reading through the reviews on this site. There were just as many excellent ratings as there were terrible and nearly the same amount of poor ratings as there were very good. In reading them it sounded like the reviews were for two different places. After going there I understand why. Like many resorts, this one offers different type of accomodations. There are the condos - which we stayed in, there are cabins, and there are hotel rooms (which more resemble motel rooms). As I mentioned, we were very happy with the condos. The motel rooms were small and dark - and we would have been extremely unhappy if we would have had to endure them for a week. I can't say much about the cabins.

We stayed in building 1. I am not really a terribly picky person, but seriously: *The room slept four, but there were only enough towels for two guests *The beds were as hard as a rock.

The NARROWEST tub I ever sat in! I couldn't lay down with my shoulders at my sides, and I'm a NORMAL sized woman! *The toilet rocked back and forth.....annoying. *Gross, rust colored stains all over the 20+ year old wallpaper, water stains on the ceiling. *Drab, dated decor (I can overlook this as long as the room is clean, but it wasn't). *We chose to make our own bed and opt out of maid service for the two nights we were there, but when we requested fresh towels, we were told they were \"out \"of clean towels, and the staff couldn't have made less of an effort to offer us any options. We took it upon ourselves to walk to the pool for towels just so we could bathe. *Neither one of the bedside lamps worked. One single bulb on the opposite wall and whatever light came from the bathroom was all we had for reading after dark. *AC was loud, but, short of turning it off, was freezing cold. *NO REPRIEVE from noisy guests, who remained noisy very late into the night (But, considering that we couldn't sleep anyway because the mattresses were so friggin' hard, that was the least of our worries). * NO FREE WIFI, which stinks (it's available at an extra charge, but seriously, almost everyone else offers it as a courtesy)! The $5 breakfast buffet is awful, unless you dig canned fruit and Tang for breakfast. Coffee was lousy. Canned biscuits. Nothing at all was good about it.

Two of the four units had balconies and larger living areas which were wonderful. We had more space than we knew what to do with! The amenities (pools, shuffleboard, etc) are nice but nothing to write home about. Location is good -- just off the red route for easy access. Three cautionary notes -- 1) the check-in process can take a long time -- long lines from 2:00 to 4:00 most every day. 2) Some of my relatives were put in the cabins near the front of the property. They're OK, but not nearly as nice as the newer ones in the midrise buildings in the back. Once they saw our units they were disappointed in their own. -- Make sure to ask for the 3200 building. 3) Skip the breakfast! They have a buffet breakfast but it's in a tiny room with not nearly enough seats for everyone inside (and who wants to eat outside when it's 90 degrees!) and the food is mediocre at best.

The resort is immaculetly maintain and rustic in nature. Plenty of options for fun at the resort with pools, jacuzzi, basketball courts, weightroom, business office with computers and printers. Daily activities available as well. Our fridge wasn't working right so made the call to maintainence and when we got back that afternoon it was working fine. I would and have recommended the resort to friends. Located so anywhere you need to go for shows is just minutes away.

My Wife and I are Westgate owners so traded one of our weeks from Westgate Painted Mountain in Mesa for a week at this resort. It is a beautiful resort, very well maintained and nice clean rooms. We had a two bedroom two bath lockoff on the second floor. Room 3822 A nd B. The problem that we encountered was at check in, we were told to come back at 4 PM as it was the check in time. Not a problem as it was almost 3 PM when we arrived. When we went back at 4PM there was a long line, so obviously the clerk didn't tell us the truth. He was very rude the first time, so I made sure to get a different clerk to check us in. The second clerk was very nice, a more mature gent than the young man we intially talked with. After he checked us in one of the stafff led us to our GUIDE, Ha HA!!!! who would show us to our room and tell us about how everything worked in the unit and about events in the town. Guess what!!!!!! This was a bad attemept to try and get us into a Time Share presentation. I told this guy that we were already Westgate owners and traded ours in Mesa for this one. I also told him why would I want to buy another timeshare with the same company when I could trade. That did not satisfy him at all, he told me that Westgate was selling the company and that he would like to explain all of the changes, another attempt to keep to try and sell us a timeshare. My Wife and I already had received a letter saying that some of the resorts were being sold, but not ours in Mesa. That was the worst thing that we encountered at the resort. There was a pond behind our unit with large Bull Frogs and Ducks in it, nice to hear the Male Bull Frogs doing their mating calls at night after curfew, not annoying but really funny to hear and almost relaxing at times. We had there Pizza twice, fantastic to say the least. We did not eat the breakfast buffett as it was always very busy. We would eat our breakfast in town, the Plantation on Hwy 76 has a $4.99 buffet, which was much nicer in all respects, food was fresh and the staff was friendly at the Plantation. Over all Westgate Branson is a great place to stay, most of the staff are friendly, the maintence folks are great and if we needed anything they were right there to take care of us. The only two things that Westgate needs to do to make this a 5 star resort is, to screen their help or set up a customer service training program for their people at the front desk, not all of them but at least two that I could name but won't unless asked by Westgate headquarters in Florida. They also need to have a convient store that sells small items, like milk bread, beer, wine, etc. Overall is is a hidden gem, well kept, everything worked well in our unit, no bugs, lots of pillows on the beds, nice soft beds and the cleanliness is impeccable. We will definitely stay there again, but timeshare folks need to know that if you already own a unit in their system why annoy them.?", "Date": "June 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missorui", "Title": "\u201cA beautiful Resort!

This is a gated community and you must check in at the gate. Seemed very secure which was nice. The grounds were beautiful and well maintained. This resort offers standard motel rooms and cabins. This is a timeshare resort as well. Upon our arrival we check in at the main building which was spacious and very nice. Our check-in agent was just great and the check-in was fast and friendly. He told us everything we needed to know about the resort and gave us written information as well. We did arrive early and had to wait about one hour before check-in. We used the time to tour the grounds in our vehicle and look around. I would suggest you arrive near check-in time or be prepared to wait. We didn\u2019t mind the wait at all and there is plenty to see at the resort. After check-in was completed you must meet with a timeshare representative for a few minutes. This is after all a timeshare resort so you have to expect that. We did not agree to take the tour due to time constraints but I wouldn\u2019t mind if we return. The representative was pretty nice until we decided not to take the tour which seemed to upset her a little. They did offer show tickets and or a gift card which seemed like a good deal to me for 1 \u00bd hours of your time. Our room was a standard two queen motel room. There are several smaller motel buildings some single and some double level along with the cabins. We had a special internet deal to purchase two nights and get a third night free. I found this on their website along with some other deals. I booked the room online with ease and the cost for three nights was a total of under $110.00 which was unbelievable. Our room was very clean and well kept. There was a microwave and refrigerator in the room. The bed we slept on was quite comfortable and the room was overall very nice. We requested room service only one day we were there and they did an excellent job cleaning the room. The service is free in the motel section and I am not sure about the cabins. It was not luxurious but it was just fine for our needs. For the price we paid it was awesome to say the least! The grounds were immaculate and workers were everywhere up keeping the property. There is a large outdoor pool which was very nice and an indoor pool as well which was nice as well. The pools and fitness room are located in and near the clubhouse building. The fitness which I used was small but had enough equipment for a decent workout. There is also a sand volleyball court, basketball court, and shuffleboard court near the outside pool. They have scheduled activities at the clubhouse if you\u2019re interested. There was not hotub/spa which I asked about and was told they will be installing a new one soon. There is always a pizza shop in the downstairs of the clubhouse with pools tables, ping pong tables, and other free games to play. We ate lunch at the pizza shop and the prices were good and the food was great! They will also deliver the food to your room if you wish. There are also outside picnic tables and grills you can use if you wish. Along with all that was a nature trail on the property. I walked the trail and you can get off at different locations so you can hike a distance you desire. I really enjoyed my walk. I walked the longest trail which seemed to be about two miles. Our experience overall was wonderful. We had a great time and the place was beautiful! Service was awesome and all the staff was very friendly.

When we arrived and started to check in another couple was really yelling and complaining about how dirty their room was... My husband and I chuckled and said to the desk clerk can't make everyone happy can you? Boy did we eat those words. The grounds for Branson Westgate off Roark Valley Road are beautiful to look at. There are things that need to be takin care of like the gate at the smaller pool dragged and the fencing screws were out of concrete(what's the purpose of the fence if not properly secured?), the pools are painted on the bottom but dosen't look like they did it this year. And, because they didn't, the chippy peel look makes it look dirtier than it was. We really enjoyed the dinner and entertainment that was provided for a small fee. Ok, what I have been dreading to share... Our condo was cute until we opened the door... It was dark, dirty and buggy. I immediately began to clean the room with lysol wipes and spray. Towels looked and smelled fresh. Bedding was a bit stained and again buggy. We would literally have to brush the beds out at night before retiring. We were in a two bedroom w/ two bath unit. Bugs seem to come out at night when the lights went out... Kitchen counters had been painted I guess, they were chipped, stained and had burnt rings from hot pans sitting on them. Needless to say the wipes I used were grey to black in color after wiping things down. The kitchen table was sticky and left water marks if you set something with moisture on it. The door track for slider was full of dead bugs, I don't even know how it opened and closed properly. Furniture in bedrooms was beat up a bit and doors did not properly work on closet or TV stands. My husband kept saying it is ok, lets just make the best of it and my daughter and I were upset. The toddler's feet were filthy, (BLACK) after just being on the floor for a little bit of time. We just were not able to really relax because we had to make sure we had shoes on and constantly shake our things out before wearing or going to bed. I didn't complain but I did tell the front desk three times about the bugs. I wanted to make sure it would be cleaned and sprayed for the next guest. Some other things that need tended to were the dumpster doors where you take your trash were hanging off the hinges. The hot tub wasn't even filled or working and it was full of dead bugs as well. There is no game room per say, it is foosball and pingpong that you have to pay for. No arcade things like pinball machines. The resturaunt on site has very good food. Eating area comes across unclean due to the stains on the carpet. It is a big resort area, again the grounds are beautiful to look at but no sidewalks to walk on and not many people drive the 20 MPH that is posted so it was a bit dangerous to be walking around at times. Especially with children. We also bought tickets from the office and found them to be cheaper w/coupons at the places we went to like The Ducks and Mosco Circus. They don't promote all shows and to be honest we probably enjoyed the ones they didn't promote the best. THE MIKE WALKER SHOW IS FANTASTIC! They also kept calling for us to go on a property tour and trying to give us free tickets and lunches.. To be honest we felt we had seen enough...

It is full of woods and hills. The property is constantly being maintained, at least on the outside. Gardners, mowers, trimmers, trash pickup, etc are going on constantly. Your car has to be a great hill climber, however, if you are in some of the cabins. To get out of the valley where we were took a mountain goat, with one hill exceeding 30 degrees upslope...but I digress. The rooms are spacious; the suites, which we were in, have a full kitchen, dishwasher and washer/dryer - very handy with an 18-month old. They were very clean, but had some problems. The TV in the main part of the suite would not go above channel 18 for some reason. The other two worked fine. The toilet paper holder in the small side room (similar to a hotel room, and could be locked off) literally fell off of the wall. Maintenance tried to repair it but, as it had been improperly repaired at least two times before, he simply made things worse to the point that an entire section of wallboard will have to be cut out and replaced. There was a large area of peeling paint above the fiberglass tub enclosure and one unpainted area above the toilet - a streak about a foot long which the painters just didn't do(!). We were in a lower unit, and the ceiling (floor) between us and the upper is quite thin. Any activity came right through, and the upstairs guests ran their washing machine at 11:00 P.M., which kept us awake as it was very loud. Now to the real problems. Most, if not all modern hotels have wi-fi or a hookup for free and many have a computer or two for guest use. This property charges quite a bit for wi-fi, and has two computers which you must pay to use. In addition, in a property with a total capacity in excess of 1800 guests, they only have three treadmills and one eliptical machine in the fitness center. Four swimming pools but only those few machines for over 1800 people? The on-site breakfast was very much the same as those offered for free at any good hotel today but they also charged for this.

We were also very nervous to sit through the presentation, we had done one once before a few years back, and were treated like second class citizens. That is putting it nicely. More on this later. Okay, we had to check in at a welcome center to receive our tickets, and certificates for dinner and other things. The ladies were very nice, and efficient. We were off to a great start! Arriving at Westgate was great. The property is beautiful. They have the cutest cabins! You'll see those as you drive to the main office. We passed the motels we would be staying in. They were cute as well! From an outside view, I was happy with what I saw. Check in was a breeze! The guy was very nice, and we were out in about 10 min. tops! And this was at about 4:30. So you would think they would be a little busy, because check in starts at 4:00. Everyone in the lobby was being handled quickly. So far so good! We were staying in building 7. Our room was clean. Plenty of towles, little soaps and shampoos. We did prefer a king, but I forgot to mention it. So we got 2 queens. That's okay no biggie. For 79$ for our entire trip, we were very pleased!. All the fixtures in the bathroom were shiny. Floors were as clean as to be expected. Large fluffy pillows, and the bed was comfortable enough. The room also had cable. We loved that because we like to watch tv right before we sleep. The room had a hair dryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board, and the most useful things were a microwave and fridge! We like to bring juices, sodas, sandwiches, and snacks with us on long trips. We are from Independence, MO so we like to travel prepared. It was sooo convenient to be able to transfer our food to the fridge on arrival. The rest of our trip was great, I won't go into our visits to area attractions.

Instead of the Villa promised in the literature, what greeted me (after the hourlong trip up the main drag in Branson and rude \"welcome\" staff) was one of the worst motel-like rooms I have ever stayed in (and that includes the unfortunate time I stayed at a \"hooker\" motel off the Vegas strip due to an emergency that forced an extra night's stay during peak travel times). The bed offered no blanket, only a sheet and grimy bedspread. The shower had no pressure and was marred with cigarette stains, the molding all around was falling off and encrusted with grime. There was no cover on the light overhead in the bath, no tissues, and a plunger sat ready for the frequently filling up toliet. The air unit had two speeds that worked...off or on. It ran constantly if on and we were either freezing or hot. We tried to order a pizza one night and were told that they had no dough (at 7PM) because the management had been \"forced\" to give away free pizzas after some major screwup upset some of the timeshare owners. Nice. The walls were paper thin, we heard everything happening in the rooms on both sides of ours as well as above us. The pool was ok. Small and crowded though. We were never more than a foot away from others. The timeshare demo was awful. After being told that \"sometimes timeshares just aren't right for everyone and if it's not for you, that's ok,\" I felt relieved and looked forward to learning more. At the end of the demo, however, when I explained why I was less than thrilled with my overall Wetsgate experience, the salesman was abusive, rude and made it clear that it was not ok at all to tell them no (this after we'd suffered through over 2 hours of presentation that was supposed to have been only 90 minutes.) He raced my family back to the sales \"pen\", said several more nasty things (in front of my six year old daughter, I might add) and said we had to wait to talk to \"corporate\" before we could go. Then we sat and sat, and sat and sat, watching as the sales rep went and spoke to someone, and pointed at us. After about 45 minutes, it became clear no one was coming, and honestly, we figured if they did, all we had to look forward to was more shabby treatment and nasty words in front of my now very upset child. So, we left. Now I worry that my credit card will be charged since we didn't get signed out. If it does, I plan to fight it tooth and nail.

The check in procedure took way too much time as there were not enough clerks operating the desk. Our timeshare presentation was fine- no complaints except that at the end the \"closing guy\" was a bit pushy. When I finally laid down the law that we were not buying and that our time was up, they quit and we were free to enjoy our stay. I would cautiously recommend this property.

Check in was very quick and we were given a map of the resort and a guest pass for the local grocery store (nice touch!). What they didn't do is tell us where anything in the resort was located.

There are 2 outdoor pools open in the warm season and an outdoor hottub open year round (small 4 person kind). There is no hottub at the indoor pool!? The resort is in the process of building a pizzeria/store which should be open this summer. There is a playground, but no nature trail. It is being used as a construction access road. The location of this resort makes it conventient to get to the shows and shopping in Branson without being in the traffic on hwy 76. The drawback is there is nothing within walking distance.

The condo was well appointed with washer, dryer, VHS & DVD player, a stereo and kitchen appliances/utensils. The only thing we missed was a wine opener.

Generally speaking, guests staying on preview packages will be assigned to a hotel room that isn't much better than a motel 6 room. Several years ago we had the unpleasant experience of staying in one of those hotel rooms on a preview package. This stay was an exchange booked through Interval International and we were assigned the one bedroom unit we had exchanged for. This was a very large one bedroom unit by timeshare standards and even had a seperate dining room rather than putthing the dining table and chairs between the kitchen and living area. The unit was clean with good furnishings. The unit had a full kitchen that was well stocked with a full size refigerator, full stove, dishwasher and garbage disposal. The living room had a fireplace with fake logs (not gas logs but plastic with a yellow/orange light behind them, sofa sleeper, two chairs and ceiling fan and good size (no big screen) TV. The bedroom had a king size bed that was reasonably comfortable and smaller TV. The bathroom had dual vanities and a nice jetted bathtub/shower combination. The unit was spottless from top to bottom. The grounds are pretty spread out but most amenities are located around the club house and by the new tower that's recently been built. The pool is nice but nothing to write home about. The second pool was very basic and just your standard rectangular pool. The hot tub was, IMO, a joke. I have a much nicer hot tub/spa at home. In the morning the water was clear but by early afternoon is was murky with all the suntan lotion in it. The fitness center is far to small for a resort of this size with only 3 treadmills, one eliptical and one stationary bike. There's also two pavilions and four nice gas grills. I saw a few older charcole grills scattered around the resort grounds as well. Our only complaint is that we were able to hear every footstep of the people in the unit above us and that we could hear even regular conversation of the people in the studio unit next to us. Timeshare resorts often have two bedroom units that can be split (locked-off) into a one bedroom and a studio unit. We could easily hear the couples conversations in the unit next to us.

We told them we were not interested in buying anymore timeshares; they said in order to receive the coupon book (which had always been given to us upon arrival) we had to sign up for the presentation. We mulled it over and then signed up for the presentation at the clubhouse the next morning. The coupon book was held back until they knew we would show up for the meeting.

Not only do you have the inconvenience of having the roaches while your there, they sometimes have a way of getting into your items that you take home.

She carefully wrote all our complaints down, assured us she would give our detailed complaints to the proper people. We then listened to the sales pitch; she finally brought in a higher up person for a last attempt pitch to get us to buy. We didn't! Branson is a beautiful place; the shows are wonderful including the people. Our week proceeded along nicely until the roaches showed up again. We just threw in the towel and left early. We did not stop at the front desk, because the club house personnel told us they would turn in our complaints to the responsible person. Upon returning home, my husband phoned westgate to inquire about our complaints and how they were being handled. We thought we should have been compensated in some manner. After investgating our complaints, the woman indeed found who our representative was that day, but no complaints had ever been turned in. Our guess is after we finished listening to their sales pitch, our complaints were crumpled up and thrown in the nearest trash can. It turned out to be our word against theirs.
