The professional, welcoming and smiling reception staff are continually superb. Nuria and the reception team are friendly to all guests and for regulars like me always remember my name and make me feel so special each arrival. The general manager, Tish Nyor went out of his way to ensure my length of stays were recognised with a lovely card and bottle of wine sent to my room with his compliments. But it gets even better! I celebrated my birthday with my son and daughter in law at the new and awesome seafood buffet ( Friday/ Saturday $40 - that is the true price at the time of my stay) A great new innovation nd so fresh and delicious ! On the 18 April I invited 14 guests from my conference to a last minute dinner plan. Called the restaurant at 5.30pm to check if it was ok and was told - of course it was!. By the time we arrived the number had grown to 22 - restaurant staff were very agreeable and made us all feel so welcome. A 3 course set menu was hurriedly put together, extra seating added, wine at the ready and meals served in a reasonable time- wow!!! Thanks soooo much Olivier, Vince and David, you are all true professionals and very gracious.

The labelling of floors is misleading - I was in Room 1211, and was informed it was on the 12th floor. Wrong. First floor above the lobby and right on a major cross-intersection hence quite noisy at all hours. The servicing of the room was woeful. My room was not attended to until sometime between 6.30pm and 9.30pm when I left for dinner out. For my 48 hour stay, the room across the hall did not have its room service tray and dishes and food scraps collectedm despite sighting several trollies in the hallway at various times.

On arrival we took a good look at the bathroom and couldn't fault it for cleanliness. The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to all the city sights. The monorail and free tourist bus is just a short walk away. There are plenty of great places to eat nearby. (Try Macchiato for breakfast.) Look I'm not entirely sure I would agree this place is 5 star. I have stayed at 4 star places in Melbourne just as nice. However on the plus side we found all the hotel staff to be genuinely friendly and courteous. The bed was super comfy. There was a window that opened - which is very rare in multi-storey hotels. Also the bar is very swanky. The negatives...our first 2 nights we had trouble sleeping due to a strange vibrating sound that continued until the wee hours. At first we thought it was doof-doof from a night club downstairs but because it stopped and started we thought it might be from the lifts. Anyway it was very annoying. Our room faced the street whereas other rooms face an internal atrium. I'd suggest if you are a light sleeper, have a word with reception staff to get a room that is a bit quieter. The other thing that blew me away about this hotel was they allowed smoking in the rooms. Some floors are non-smoking and others allow it! I thought this was crazy. I can't remember the last time I was in a Melbourne hotel that allowed smoking. We were thankfully accommodated on a non-smoking floor but pity the poor woman we spoke to in the lift who had requested non-smoking but her family were put on a smoking floor and could smell smoke coming under the door. The hotel could not move her to a non-smoking room and offered a bottle of champagne and a fruit basket as compensation.

As a frequent business traveller, cleanliness, comfort and impecable service are the top of my priority list. My recent experience has made me wonder where is the hospitality in this hospitalty business and if \"Priority Guests\" really are! Upon arrival my fast web check in took 15 minutes as the computer system was down. This did not make me unhappy as I totally understand what chaos this can cause. I went to my \"deluxe\" room and it did not resemble anything \"deluxe\". I rang reception and enquired to see if there had been a mistake in allocating my room, perhaps, due to the computer problem. The female receptionist (french?)very rudely told me that this was the room I booked and hung up. The room was a smoking room on a smoking floor, being a non smoker I certainly did not book this. There were cigarette butts on the window ledge,the room stunk and the view was of a litter filled roof area. There was not 1 wall in this room that did not have something (wine?) splashed on it. I called reception again and asked to change rooms, this time I spoke to a very polite young man who explained again about the computer problems and advised that he would find me something else.Three hours later I rang again and was given another room. Very clean and fresh! Same furniture without the scuff marks and scratches. The good bits: Bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Lovely shower with good water pressure. Food ordered from room service was beautiful. Room service staff polite and courteous. Location very central to business district and china town. Overall not great value for money considering there are a few hotels in the same presinct to choose from.The management need to do a thourough room check in regards to small maintainence issues and cleaning.

She said i have to make a payment and when i said i checked this, she calmly said it was a mistake and nothing could be done about it. It was frustrating to hear a hotel with whom you have made a booking through one of their trusted partner had no option left for me. I did wonder if i did not check in at all, they would still charge the card the full amount for no show. They could have as easily checked me in. Finally after battling it out, manager did let me in seamlessly while explaining the way forward. But by then i already wasted 2 hours before i could get my room. The overall check-in process was a real nightmare and i hate to say this but a badly trained staff is the last thing i expected. Besides which, step out of the room and you will find cigarette butts lying in the passage. When i informed the staff about this, got a very mild response to it. Worst, business travellers, you are better off not relying on the wifi connection of the hotel, its available only in the lobby area. The rooms were clean and pretty well maintained, no complaints there. Overall, not a good experience from the staff. But a special thanks to David and the manager who's name i cannot recall for making it a bit easy for me.

It was a nice surprise to find out it was a Rydges hotel as I've stayed in their hotels in Melbourne, Perth, Cairns and Brisbane and they've always been consistently good. This was no different. Helpful staff, reasonable sized rooms, huge towels, good restaurant, all the extras of a 4+ star hotel. The highlight though of any Rydges stay has to be the bed! They are truly one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. The room was a little tired - clean but showing wear - there were scuff marks on the paintwork, the carpet was a little worn and the decor a bit dated. The shower pressure was a bit on the low side but on the plus it was a very generous bathroom with lots of room to move. The best thing about the hotel though is its location. If you stay make sure you venture out and down to the World Square food court - some good spots for breakfast, a couple of fresh juice bars, some reasonable looking Sushi places and so on - if you turn right when you walk out the front, the lower part of Pitt St offers a reasonable choice of places to eat and Hyde Park is just around the corner. I caught a taxi from the Airport but you could use the train - Museum Station is just a short walk.

Unfortunately for a few months we have had to be accommodated in the rydges world square & it is certainly a huge come down! The place is ghastly! On arrival it was immediately apparent that the location left much to be desired & that the new accommodation was not going to be up to scratch. The hotel entrance is located directly across from Eric's adult bookstore & the Chicago massage parlour...I was meeting a friend that evening & was not particularly comfortable standing outside waiting for her to pick me up. It was the sort of location a lone female would expect to get solicited for business in! The hotel rooms were bland & basic, the carpets were grubby & there was an overall smell of damp. The standard of cleanliness elsewhere was dreadful. There was a room service tray of half eaten food in the corridor which was still there two days later having never been removed. Had housekeeping bothered to actually come down that corridor at all in 48 hours or could they just not be bothered to remove it?! The gym was poor. No sweat towels provided, very poor quality & severe lack of equipment. Decor was like something from a prison. On a safety note I was horrified to find that the exit doors on each floor automatically locked behind you. When I needed to drop a note to a colleague on the floor below me I decided to take the stairs rather than the lift. However once I had entered the stairwell I could not get back into the hotel on any level! It is also worth noting that the stairwell was full of cigarette butt ends! I had to go all the way down & out of the fire escape to then re enter the hotel via the main door & then take the lift. Not only is this ridiculous but it is a safety hazard. Had the stairwell been full of smoke a few floors below I would have been stuck in a suffocating space unable to return to the non smoky floor that I had just left & the only escape would have been to throw myself through the fire or smoke to the exit door 15 floors below! I mentioned this to the hotel who did not seem remotely bothered & who remarked that it was a legal requirement...that is [--] about logic if ever I heard it but then we are talking about down under! Understandably the main exit door to the street should automatically lock to keep out the vagrants (of which the location presented many!) but guests should be able to use the stairs to transverse floors of the hotel....they are always banging on about being Eco friendly after all so why only allow use of the lift?!

The same staff member (Sheree? - A lovely Chinese girls anyway) served me the next morning and was friendly, smiling and helpful. Room was great. Excellent water pressure in shower. Responsive air conditioning. Rydges \"super bed\" or whatever it's called was very comfy and restful. Room was very clean. Only negative thing was the floor numbering of the hotel - it's deceiving. I was on the \"15th\" floor, but this is really the 5th floor - rooms start on floor 10, which is the 1st floor. Weird system. Also, when I wanted to sleep-in the next morning, housekeeping staff in other rooms doing their job were VERY noisy. I know they have work to do and need to do it quickly, but there seemed to be an army of them, and they were really chatty, noisy and banged things around a lot. Really minor detail but thought I'd mention it. Parking at $50 is way over-priced, but that's Sydney for you. Location is excellent, although can be difficult for cabs to stop outside the hotel at times. Mini bar priced quite well considering it's a 4-star hotel in downtown Sydney.

After booking we discovered we were staying at Rydges World Square which suited us as it was located 200mtrs from our party. We arrived at 230pm but drove around the block several times trying to work out where to stop for parking as it is not stated on their website that you have to pull over in the bus bay/ no stopping area and give your keys to the staff to park your cars. We finally got 5 min parking down the road and ran in to discover the above..This is when we also discovered it was $50 for parking, not from being told or reading it on the hotel's website as NOTHING is said about the price of parking, there was however a small sign in the corner of the door (outside) with a member of staff standing infront of. Very expensive and our \"Mystery Deal\" which we thought was excellent and cheap just became more expensive than the usual 4 star accommodation we stay at in the city for work functions (that has a $25 parking fee!) Whilst checking in we were told we had been given a complimentery room upgrade. We were impressed with that! And we were on level 19. We made our way to the lifts which are located to the left of reception when my fiance then asked were these the lifts we use. We were told \"No, they are around the corner (opposite direction to what we went in, about 50 mtrs away). While the reception staff we dealt with were friendly, this information should be relayed to guests when checking in just out of courtesy. The levels are a bit misleading also. I anticipated level 19 would be quite high, however, ground floor is actually level 10...so you are really only up 9 floors. Not sure why they do this. Our room was small but nice. Bathroom was nice, but hot water is not all that \":hot\", bedding was nice, pillows were amazing. Our room,1920, only had 1 bathrobe in it which we found a little strange. Whilst we didn't eat or drink anything in the mini bar we did have a look and find the Chips expired in September 2011 (When we were checking in an Overseas Flight Attendant complained to reception about the same issue in her room!) We went to our party and then returned at 12am. The room had an opening window but we did not open it as the nightclubs downstairs were quite noisy even with the window shut. This is not the hotels fault. At 2am, incase we missed the sign due to staff standing infront of it, a bill for $50 for parking was slipped under our room door. The next morning both my fiance and I awoke with spots/bites all over us. We assume it is from bed bugs in the room as we even have spots/bites on parts of our body that were covered by clothes when we were out at the function and at no point during the evening did either of us notice any mozzies about. I did send an email to the hotel notifying them of the spots and the chips, however, I did not even recieve an acknowledgement or reply of my email and I did include my contact number on the email. All in all, yes I would stay there again for a maximum of 1 night IF I could not get accommodation at my usual hotel (Bayview Boulevard), however I would leave my car in a Wilsons Car park close by and save the $50 parking fee.

So when we had to make an overnight trip to Australia's biggest city and couldn't arrange to stay with friends, we picked a Wotif 'mystery deal'. It delivered Rydges, and at AU$159 about half the price of the hotel's own website 'hot price' of $299. So far, so good. The hotel describes itself as \"Luxury accommodation in Sydney city\", and is rated at 4.5 stars. The location really is central - a short walk from great food at Chinatown in one direction, and and the shopping area of Pitt St Mall and QVB in the other. World Square is a shopping mall itself. Tourists can hop on a train at Town Hall Station below the hotel and ride around to Circular Quay for the Opera House and Harbour Bridge in just a few minutes. The 'luxury' bit is open to interpretation. Parts of the decor are very tired - the many decorative photos on the 18th floor are all badly faded. Room fittings and bathroom are all functional and very clean, but getting old. Shower and bath are separate which is great, but the water is barely hot enough for a bath. The TV was an old flat screen carrying just a Sky News feed with no access to the many digital free-to-air channels eg. ABC News 24 - a frustrating gap on a weekend when three big world news stories broke. No wifi in the rooms. The beds were very comfortable, a definite plus. One real disappointment - we had booked a king sized non-smoking room, but when we arrived the only non-smoking room was a twin room, which wasn't quite what we wanted. Some of the rooms should have an interesting street view, but ours looked out onto another building; good thing we weren't tourists looking for a one-off 'Sydney experience' with view. It was a nice room - but hard to see the value if paying $299 or more. While it might tick the 4.5 star boxes there isn't a 4.5 star feel about the place. What makes accommodation in Australia particularly expensive is the tendency to charge extra for everything. $49 a night for parking! $5 an hour for wifi, in the lobby only! The standard brand bottled water, conveniently located by the bedside, $4! You could go downstairs to the supermarket directly below the hotel and buy the water for a quarter of the price, except that Australian tap water is exactly the same and free. Verdict: okay, if you can get a discount deal. If driving, consider parking elsewhere. Tip: We made the mistake of arriving at about 6pm. Don't do it. Chaos: there were 7 kinds of idiot queued 3 deep at the check-in counter - probably all on cheap deals like us, I'll admit - all loudly demanding impossible things or being ridiculously difficult. The poor staff were polite but clearly frazzled.

The time was 5:55pm we approached the restaurant and asked if we could have dinner - the waiter said - Yes, but come back in 5 minutes dinner does not start till 6pm (5 minutes to wait). To look at the restaurant it was fully set it is open plan so no walls from the lobby area - but don't step on the carpet for another 5 minutes! We first asked if we could sit in the restaurant and have a drink - No its closed! then we asked if we can have a drink two steps outside the restaurant in the \"lobby\"; the answer is yes you can sit in the lobby and wait - there were four of us and all the tables in the lobby were set up for 2 people only; I go to move the chair and the waiter said please don't - so there was an expectation that we sit separately. I then asked if we could move chairs that weren't in the walk way - he said yes but was obviously not happy - So now we were sitting next to the toilets - nice!. When taking our order I asked for a bar food menu he suggested nuts we said no we want something more substantial with our drinks. He then brought out a bar menu and a restaurant menu and tossed them on the table and walked away. To order I went up to the restaurant to ask if I could order and they said No you need to go into the bar. Ok! So I go into the bar then someone tells me you can't eat food in the lobby you need to come into the bar - but they drinks you purchased had to drunk in the lobby first (they are form the restaurant...hold on isn't the restaurant closed?). I then asked \"Well why give me a menu and not tell me that in the first place\" he responded \"Lady! (yes he called me lady whilst putting a stop hand up to my face) Calm down you asked for it so I gave it, you got what you wanted\" By this stage I was so frustrated I dropped the menu (which was hard plastic so it made quite a sound) and informed him that his service had been terrible; he informed me he didn't care. When asking for his name \"Sam\" happily gave it to me and had a giggle about the whole situation. On way back to the lobby to finish my drink - I realised it was after 6 & people were sitting in the restaurant, yet not one employee came to inform my group it was now open they left us sitting by the toilet! Once in the restaurant even though it was quite expensive for the food you were served (I expected this we did decide to eat in a hotel restaurant, so no big deal) the young man that served us (dark brown/red hair fringe swept to the side) was very pleasant - did he anticipate our needs \"no\" - how do I know what the ice well food is? An explanation of the menu would've been nice; but when asked he was helpful and accommodating, and his table service was great - thankyou! However\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6(even with such a positive service experience you are still tainted\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) When being shoved in a corner and treated like a second class citizen you notice things - like lip stick marks on the glasses, all the newspapers thrown around and not tidied up, coffee cups that had been on table so long the liquid had gone hard in the bottom, chairs with stains and not lined up; finally our meals (3 steaks and a rack of lamb took over an 55 minutes to come out - only 9 other people in the restaurant) Plus not once did you see a manager or a staff member walk through or in our case someone to come and see if we were ok- after the situation we had been through. I know I can seem harsh with a service review - but seriously this one team member set the tone for the entire night - I have told anyone that will listen about the service and how we were treated and how everything was just to hard.

Despite this, once I arrived 40 minutes later I was told that this was not the case but could store bags until it was ready. While this did not overly affect my plans (I had originally planned to leave bags with concierge, anticipating that I could check in at 2pm) it was frustrating that this had apparently changed in such a short space of time. If for some reason I had made a dedicated trip to the hotel early believing I could check in a few hours early, and was told upon arrival that I couldn't, I would have been much more annoyed at being misinformed. Upon checking in a few hours later I unpacked (mistake - check basic amenities first!) and found a couple of issues - the window wouldn't close which was frustrating from a draught and noise perspective, and the shower would keep turning itself off due to a problem with the tap. However the room itself was nice enough and of decent size for one or two people to stay in, and I've certainly stayed in worse. Good: - Location is the key selling point here, and if you won't spend a heap of time in your room it's probably one of the best options. - The beds - one of the more comfortable options I've had to use. - When I eventually did check in, the process was quick and easy, with the front desk staff being quite helpful Bad: - Bathroom looks a little dated and had issues with the facilities. Could use an update. - Fitness centre barely qualifies, with a few machines that quite frankly are not enjoyable to use. Any more than two or three other travellers in there, and you have issues with waiting to use machines. While sharing is caring, it can double your workout time. Avoid. - Food seemed expensive and you can probably get better quality and cost in any dedicated restaurants within a few minutes walk. - My TV had one or two issues and had to reboot itself a few times - but not a big issue. - There was some rubbish left under one of the beds so I did question what else it was that they had not cleaned thoroughly...

After reading reviews I decided on the rydges world square. Initially the location was ideal, (right near China Town, 20 mins walk from circular quay and 10 mins walk from Darling Harbour) however the noise from the street was unbearable! We were on the 18th floor and there was so many loud exhausts, sirens and people shouting in the street that I did not get a good night sleep the whole time we were there. The staff were not attentive at all, either in the hotel or the restaurant. In fact the restaurant was the most uncomfortable meal I have ever had! All over the hotel there were posters advertising 2 courses for $35 in the restaurant. We decided to go down one night and eat there. We ordered our meal however when it came (and it took ages) it was the smallest meal I have ever seen and it did not come with sides. I complained that we should have been asked if we wanted sides with our meal and promptly ordered the sides. It was then that the meal got uncomfortable, the sides took approx 10 mins to come, in the mean time we were left with our meal on the table in front of us getting cold. The staff did not even offer to keep it warm for us or take it away, I felt as though everyone in the restaurant were looking at us and that all the staff were talking about us. Desert was nothing to write home about either and actually (even with the addition of sides) we were both left very hungry after the meal! When we came to pay, the sides were $11 each so in fact if you wanted to feel like you had been fed you needed to spend at least $46 for 2 courses. I did complain about this and the staff did remove the cost of the sides and our drinks from the bill but even still $75 still felt like a complete rip off and I couldn't get out of there quick enough! Overall, I wish we had saved a bit of our money on the hotel and gone a bit more down market with the hotel in sydney as the hotel was just a noisy room really.

Eventually, four concierge staff walked around the corner...talking amongst themselves....not acknowledging my presence for at least a minute...eventually one asked, \"Do you want something\"...no greeting at all.

The ironing board collapsed several times when I was first using it, however housekeeping did deliver one to us quickly when we mentioned it. When we arrived a prior guest had left a half eaten hamburger in a takeaway container in the fridge, we put this in the bin but did mention it to the reception briefly when having some room cards fixed in order to help with quality assurance, we got an immediate apology and were given some complimentary breakfasts, which was really lovely, we hadn't expected that and the breakfast food and service were impeccable. As women, it was disappointing that there was no provision for the disposal of feminine hygiene items, one of the girls I was with felt very uncomfortable putting her items into an open bin in the bathroom, even public toilets have more discretion and I hope this is something Rydges can look into. We stayed over the St Paddy's day weekend and the nightclubs/hotels are very loud and there was thumping music until the early hours of the morning each night. This isn't the hotel's fault but it is something you need to be aware of before staying there. We had used RPG points to book our stay and the surcharges were not made clear to us, ie whether the charge we were paying was per night or for the whole stay, so it was a little bit of a surprise to find out it was a per night thing and made the trip much more expensive than we had thought, but this was not necessarily the hotel's fault, but something as a consumer you would need to be more clear on. We did end up buying dinner one night at the bar, only to find out that RPG discounts didn't apply there for food, another thing I didn't feel was made clear. The food we purchased was utterly delicious, especially the hand cut chips with aioli, we enjoyed it so much that we decided to splurge and get a few serves of them delivered as room service as a treat on another night. The room service ones were $1 per serve more expensive at $8 each, so we thought that was reasonable, however when they arrived there was an additional $5 charge for the delivery. I wasn't particularly upset about the extra charge, however the quality of the food was disgusting and the polar opposite from the ones served downstairs, they were worse than what you would get in a food court and nothing like the ones we had gotten in the bar, which were crunchy and fresh and served in lovely baskets, the room service ones were soggy and thrown in a bowl. This was very disappointing as we had assumed they would be of the same quality and I assume cooked in the same kitchen. The tomato relish was also rancid/rotten. I did consider complaining about this, however I don't like having to constantly chase people to give consistent service. I think getting room service is one of those luxuries people want to experience and if done well it would be one of the highlights of a hotel stay, the girls I took were having their first ever hotel experience and so having room service at least once was something they had saved money for and sadly they probably wouldn't do it again. When we got home, I received a bill for $22 for a bottle of wine, a packet of chips and a tim tam bar. I am a teetotaller and was attending a christian women's conference where we were even given free tim tams in our conference packs. I was attending with two older teenagers who I was with at all times who had both worked in retail to pay for their own and my expenses and are extremely responsible. As we were on a budget we had gone to Coles directly under the hotel and purchased our own snacks and had such an abundance we bought two bags worth home. We were attending a conference the whole time so apart from getting ready in the morning and coming home to sleep we were not at the hotel, so I was more than a little surprised to receive a letter from the hotel some days after leaving telling us we had used the items from the minibar. This puts customers in a very difficult predicament, because even if I know for a fact that I didn't use the items and the hotel \"forgives\" the charge, I am made to feel as though they still suspect I am the one being deceitful and I don't like being made to feel that way. The letter states that in writing to me they are somehow better than other hotels that instantly charge you without consulting with you. To be honest this doesn't feel any different to me and if someone says you used it but doesn't end up charging you because you fight it, you don't really feel like you came out of it I feel that there should be an option to just not have anything in the minibar, we had no intention of using it and we know we didn't, but we have no way of proving that and the mere accusation of it is upsetting (even though it won't kill me to pay the money). This would definitely impact on my choice to use the hotel again and the fact that I got the letter some days after I got home has left a very sour taste in my mouth. I do feel as though there is an ability to rort this system, both by the hotel and staff, who could take things, or forget to put things in and then you pay the price. If you charged each guest an additonal $20 like this it would really add up. I will in future be asking any hotel I stay in to remove all minibar items, but I feel saddened that I have to do this and that I am made to feel as though it is my responsibility to protect my reputation against this sort of thing.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWas ok, nothing to rave about\u201d", "Author": "MissA88", "ReviewID": "UR98464944", "Content": "Stayed for 4 nights in January, had requested early checkin but had not been advised that it would be a problem and were told upon arrival that there would be a 2 hour wait.

If you are going to do this, be sure to sign up to become a priorty guest before making any bookings. It is free to do so online on their website and means you then have access to cheaper room rates, so why wouldn't you! We got the first nights room at a rate of AUD $171. We first booked for only one night, then extended the stay to another night (this was all last minute due to heatwave in Sydney and needing a hotel with aircon!). The second night the best they could do for us was AUD $270, because they said the hotel was pretty full - apparently is an airline hotel, so occupied with airline staff a lot of the time. We were in a room on the 13th floor, at the end of the corridor which was nice and pretty quiet. View overlooked Pitt St, so just looking into office buildings and shops, nothing spectacular there. But we weren't there for a view. Got a little street noise at night, but nothing that affected sleep quality at all. Room was decent sized, nothing special... your standard hotel room with dated furniture - a desk, little table and one chair, flat screen TV - no DVD player or anything like that. Fridge, coffee and tea making facilities. We got a king room and the bed was good - firm and comfortable and allowed for a good nights sleep. Like other reviews, there was nothing parcitularly WRONG with the hotel, just not amazing or overly special...just comfortable. The location was great - right in world square which has a bunch of Asian inspired eateries and shops, George St just around the corner - so you are definitely in the hub of the city. The few gripes we did have were as follows: Bathroom cleanliness wasn't up to standard. Hairs on floor, found big clumps of hair and marks on supposedly clean fresh towels - had to call to get them replaced. We told them why we needed new ones, but they didn't seem to care. I kept finding stray hairs in different places, on the bed, sheets, etc. They called up to our room to say we hadn't signed something on check in, would I come down and do it - considering I had just got in to the room to relax in the aircon and was already undressed, etc - no I wasn't going to put everything back on to trek back downstairs for your error! The lady heard my hesitation and then said 'oh, I can come up to you\"....which she did. When she arrived it was an exact copy of what I HAD already signed at reception. When I told her that, she apologised. Also a LOT of dust in the place, the bedside tables, bedhead, desk, lamps, etc etc. They overcharged us for room service and also charged us for a beer we hadn't removed from the minibar. This was recitifed on check out though. We ordered room service, which was not great. The mains - mac n cheese and a pizza were below average, just no flavour. The dessert - chocolate fondant was alright. It just seemed to miss the mark with the trimmings you would have expected, like...plates to eat off! They just sort of dumped the food on the tiny table in the room and left. So overall, I probably enjoyed this hotel more because we were desperarte to get into somewhere with airconditiong!

Service from start to finish was very good with efficient, professional and pleasant check in and checkout occurring at Reception. All staff members we encountered throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful whether they were cleaners, concierge staff or bar staff. Our room was a good size; the king bed was terrific for a good night's sleep after wandering about the city sights all day; supplied toiletries were replenished appropriately; and linen and towels were very clean. We returned each day to a well vacuumed, clean room and bathroom. Our room was right above a bar in the World Square precinct but we couldn't hear a peep with the balcony door closed. The executive club breakfast was fine and plentiful - cereals, fruit, toasts, pastries, boiled eggs, baby bacon and sausage servings, juices and coffee. This was plenty for us to start off our days' explorations and provided a relaxed environment to read the newspapers (although I would have liked to see ABC 24 Hour News on the TV). The location is good for both sightseeing and shopping. The Concierge advised us of the free 555 bus which leaves from nearby George Street and you can hop on, hop off at major points of interest. Alternatively, it's an interesting walk through the CBD to Circular Quay etc. There are ample shopping and dining options within World Square itself, including a Coles supermarket, or you can comfortably walk down to Chinatown and Darling Harbour.

It starts with the people and managers at the reception. They are very respectful and accomodating and always try their best for you. When I was given a room near a lift, I requested a room in a quieter location and I was given one without any hassle. I also had an unusual request that required a great deal of follow-up that another manager (Mr. Gao) successfully fulfilled. The rooms that I stayed in on both occasions were very quiet. I could not hear anything from adjacent rooms, the hallway or people above me. The beds were truely 'dream beds'. They were soo comfortable. The matresses were firm but they had a thick layer of padding over them. The pillows were also very comfortable. The room is minimalist in that it really doesn't have much drawer space, but I found the shelves and closet adequeate to hold a whole month's worth of clothing. The bathrooms were modern. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. Once again the bathroom was minimalist and there is very little room to put cosmetics and toiletries (this could use some improvement) . The weak spot is the housekeeping. On my second stay, everyday I returned to my room to find something missing (no bath mat on 2 occasions, no towels on one occasion, the remote control on one occasion, etc). I was finally told that they changed their laundry provider and there were shortages. Since this didn't happen during my first stay I hope they have cleared up this problem. There was also a change in the resaurant from my first stay to the second stay with the food preparation going from 4 star to less than one star. The second chef just didn't know how to cook. Medium rare lamb chops came out well done and when I returned them and I asked for medium rare I was told that it could only be cooked medium because it was a thrid cut (whatever that means). I also had a problem with an omlette on the second stay. It came out runny and with so much salt and peepper that it burned my tongue. I hope that this will be addressed as the restauant on the first stay was really good and it was nice to have it in the hotel. It really pays to join the Priority club as the full buffet breakfast only costs $15 AUD for members and there is 20% off the dinners. The location is excellent. It is centrally located and there is a 555 bus that is free and goes along George St to the circular quay. It is also convenient to may other busses. There is also a 'mall' below the hotel that has many of the services that a traveler needs (drug store, newsstand, supermarket, restaurants and take away food places, clothing shops, dry cleaners, etc).

I'll stop there as the list is even longer... would not go back and regret trusting other comments and believe me, I have travelled the world and stayed in much cheaper hotels but have never had to complain (twice) about smelly toilets and having to do it myself at the end of the day. No need to say staff didn't offer anything to compensate (free coffee for instance might have appeased and angry customer). Staff is nice, and location is good (excellent Malaysian restaurant round the corner for lovely laksa) but staying in a place that does not feel clean is an unpleasant feeling especially when you pay 250 AUD a night for 5 nights !", "Date": "July 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pilbara", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, family room is fantastic\u201d", "Author": "SweetPea04", "ReviewID": "UR71328333", "Content": "Stayed here for two nights with two young children in a family room.

One of the many hotels we stayed in this trip is Rydges World Square and was impressed with a few incidents. I thought I would share for all to know. 1. We arrived very early in Sydney (6am). The flight from Singapore to Sydney was terrible. We had twin children in the cabin that cried throughout the 7 hrs. We had no sleep / rest at all. Reached the hotel at 7am. The front desk staff was not able to give us any room as the hotel was running full the night before. We went out for breakfast, however our older and younger folks were really exhausted from the flight and not able to do any other things else. We went back to the hotel at 10am hoping the rooms will be ready for us. The front desk empathize with our situation but can gave us a room. This was really good especially for our in-laws! 2. We checked out of the hotel the next day early morning to pick up the rental car for Jindabyne. Had the breakfast in the hotel. The staff advise us to register to be member as we will be able to enjoy brekky at $15 instead of $25. We did that and paid cash for the meal. Upon reaching home (8 days later) we saw a bill for the breakfast. Immediately I wrote to the hotel that evening and the very next day morning they rang (which I missed the call) and wrote an email. They apologised for the mixed up and will arrange for the refund. From the above incident, I am really impressed with their speed and efficiency to investigate and rectify the mix up. The staff are all trained and friendly to dish out beneficial advice to guests. The hotel is also very central to access to Chinatown, Darling Harbour and the major shopping places along George Street. The only little thing I could not comprehend is that why there is a need to charge 1.5% more for credit card payment.

Good Parts: The hotel is centrall;y located covering nearly a whole city block (George Street/Liverpool Street and Pitt Street. Staff were pleasant and helpful at all times. Rooms were nice and comfy and the king size bed was really nice to sleep on. Breakfast was good and catered for most tastes. The hotel is surrounded by pubs, cafes, restaurants, shopping arcades and is within walking distance to most of Sydney's attractions. There is a mono rail station located at World Square which is about one minute away and this services many of the attractions including Darling Harbour, China Town, Paddy's Markets, Convention Centre, PowerHouse Museum, Maritime Museum, Aquatic Centre and a few others. Town Hall Railway Station is about 300 metres away up George Street as is the Town Hall, Queen Victoria Building, City of Sydney RSL, Kristy Kreme Donuts as well as hundreds of other boutique stores, cafes, bars etc. The nearest internet cafe is in the shopping arcade next to the hotel (2 to choose from) and another 100 metres up George Street. Bad Parts: Check in time isn't until 2:00 pm and check out is 12:00 pm unless you want to pay an extra $50.00 to stay until 3:00 pm. Whilst the rooms were clean the hallways were musty. It took a long time to get the room made up each day, some times as late as 3:00 pm so it may be advisable to leave the \"Please Make Up Room\" sign on the door. The rooms facing Liverpool Street were a bit noisy especially when an ambulance or police car went by with sirens blaring which was quite often. At breakfast they did not have a dedicated egg station instead you had to order your eggs from the waiter and this was a bit difficult at times because many of them did not speak English all that well.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cClean, Functional, Great bed!\"\u201d", "Author": "Britpop73", "ReviewID": "UR57131601", "Content": "Clean, welcoming, got upgraded to a big family room as they had run out of non-smoking rooms!

The receptionists were all very friendly and they seemed to put the efforts to accommodate me with the room earlier, which eventually they couldn't!! But after all, I truly appreciated their efforts. Let's get started with the room. It is a clean modern room with decent space to \"breathe\" especially if you're traveling with partners. The bed is very much comfortable to sleep on, I had a deep sleep!! I love the pillow options too. The bathroom is fitted with a tub as well as amenities provided. I didn't use the facilities in this hotel so I can't really say much about it here. Talking about location, Rydges is a nice base to explore Sydney. It is located in the city centre so it is fairly easy to walk to almost everything. There are many restaurants outside the hotel, so I strongly suggest you to leave the restaurants in the hotel and go outside to try the local flavor. Juicy tips: Try Din Tai Fung restaurant just behind the hotel. They serve the world's best dumplings I've ever tasted. Succulent skin, thick juicy soup inside the dumpling and to top it off, dip in the vinegar sauce. The only drawback of this hotel is that the carpet is filthy! So many stains and I can smell the dust on the carpet! It is so sad to learn this issue because it can lever down the cleanliness standard of this hotel.

The tiles aren't spotless- there is some dirt/mould on the grout and the cleaning isn't that thorough. Overall the bathroom was a bit dirty/not really a nice relaxing environment... so I didn't even contemplate using the bath to soak in. Also I rang housekeeping at about 9pm to ask for some different pillows (as we found the feather pillows provided to be quite uncomfortable). Noone at housekeeping answered so reception answered- the lady didn't appear to know anything about the pillow menu available & said she would check with housekeeping- she then rang me back and advised that all the pillows had already been checked out by other customers.

Since we stepped into the hotel, the bell boy was more than willing to help us take our luggage, whilst we went upstairs to check on the room availability. We were early(9am), so both rooms were not ready. We were told that the rooms would be ready by 2pm. The only thing i'm not so happy about is that our family room is only ready at around 4pm, instead of the original 2pm as agreed. also internet access was quite confusing. If you had plugged in 2 different laptops in the same room, you'll be charged twice, but the reception waived the extra charges immediately when you notified them. If you are a priority member, you pay only AUD11 per day for internet access, which is pretty cool. On the whole we received good /warm services from all the staffs in the hotel, and one of my friends lost the card, which was replaced without charge. I would definitely go back, if i visit Sydney again. The location is great, near to supermarket, train station, monorail, eateries, etc...

The rooms do not contain any kind of kitchen facilities, however, we utilised the kettle, 4 cups, 2 glasses, and 4 teaspoons heavily! We ate our breakfast in our room based on supplies such as fruit from the supermarket, supplemented by early morning hot food purchases from the shops in Liverpool Street. We ate in Chinatown at Golden Century (expensive seafood, must book), at Wagaya in Harbour Street (Japanese with a TV screen waiter), at Din Tai Fung in World Square (twice for fantastic Taiwanese experience, must get there at opening time), and at Sea Bay in Pitt Street (very simple dumplings and soup, nothing special). The laundry is on the 12th floor. We needed 7 x $1 coins (1 for powder, 3 for the washer, 3 for the dryer). The gym is also on this level, and overlooks the Korean BBQ. We enjoyed hopping on the monorail, taking the 555 free bus to Circular Quay, walking in Hyde Park, walking to Queen Victoria Building and also to the Chinese Gardens (wonderful).

For some stupid reason I left it until only 2-3 months before booking a hotel room: bad mistake! By then most hotels were either full or charging an exorbitant rate for that period. Enter the Rydges, which was the only central Sydney hotel offering fairly good rates over that period. So the choice was really made for us and we couldn't be picky. Having read about it, I signed up for Rydges Priority Club, which gives you discounts on the rates (and a few other perks, like free welcome drinks, late checkout and discounts on food and drinks at the hotel). We decided to pay a little extra for an executive room, which is on a higher floor and gives access to the executive lounge on the 20th floor, where you have a free light breakfast and free drinks and snacks between 5-7pm. We arrived early in the morning to hear that our room wasn't ready yet, and we should come back at 2pm. Whilst this was their standard policy, I thought they could have perhaps make an effort and try to get the room ready a little earlier. Nevermind, we left the bags with the concierge and went about our day. We came back later and were assigned a room on the 21st floor. Apart from this minor displeasure, the reception staff were always extremely friendly, courteous and helpful. The room was nice and spacious enough, and the \"dream bed\" really deserves its name, as it is positively sumptuous. There was a modern (and large) flatscreen TV and the bathroom was clean and spacious. However, we faced a concrete wall and consequently the room was very dark, even in the brightest days. The next day we asked to be moved and were attended by an extremely helpful trainee manager (Peter?), who not only changed the room, but also upgraded us to a suite! This was an extremely nice gesture, especially since we would have been quite happy with an equivalent room with a little more of a view! Top marks there. The executive lounge system, however, was a bit mesmerizing. The lounge is staffed by a single employee, and whilst the food is displayed in a buffet, there are no glasses, drinks, or cutlery on display. You have to sit, and wait for the extremely overworked waiter to come and set your table, then ask what you would like to drink, and finally, come back 5 minutes later with your drink. This system meant that we ended up spending twice as long as we wanted/needed to at the lounge (which, by the way, is also too small and becomes full at peak times). Here's a suggestion to management: have two employees there permanently, and lay out the drinks and glasses at the buffet. That way, the waiters can concentrate exclusively on setting and clearing the tables and getting people's room numbers. It was a bit sad and funny at the same time watching other guests piling up on the free food/drinks in the afternoon. It looked like some people were relying on that for their main meal! We had mixed feelings regarding the concierge desk too. It seemed like they were constantly busy (understaffed?) and I had the feeling they would gladly make bookings, but I wouldn't want to rely on their recommendations. On one occasion, a bell captain was filling in for the concierge and told us Cafe Sydney didn't take any bookings. The next day, we showed up at this restaurant and only got a table by luck, as it turns out reservations are actually essential there! And it's not like this is an unknown restaurant, on the contrary, it's probably one of the best known in Sydney and therefore the concierge (or his replacement) should have known this. Location wise, while this is not exactly like being on Circular Quay, it was still very good. There's a monorail station right under the hotel, and it's only 2 blocks to the bus stop from which you can catch buses to Bondi, Paddington, King's Cross, Watson's Bay... In the immediate vicinity of the hotel you will find many 24h convenience stores, a cinema and many (mostly Korean) so-so restaurants. The credit card surcharge (expecially hefty if you pay by Amex) is an unwelcome surprise at checkout. Are they trying to set a trend here? I hope not, as it gave me a downmarket feeling, as if I were booking a flight with a budget airline. It's worth staying here if you get a good rate, but I would rate this hotel more like a 3.5 star.", "Date": "January 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot too bad, but could have been a LOT better! Don't pay the rack rate!!!\u201d", "Author": "Cris_P_Bacon", "ReviewID": "UR23086874", "Content": "I stayed at the Rydges World Square Sydney for 4 nights. I got a decent rate by booking it through an extremely helpful friendly lady on a travellers helpdesk at Sydney Domestic Airport. She told me that the Rydges group had recently taken it over and pumped big bucks into it. She got me a good deal. I had previously looked at this hotel, both on the Rydges website and on wotif.com but found the prices to be a bit expensive, especially as this hotel is not really that close to the usual Sydney attractions of the Bridge, the Opera House and the Rocks. The hotel is on Pitt, one of the main routes through the CBD. It has a monorail station right outside and is also handy for places such as the Haymarket, Darling Harbour, China Town and Paddys Markets (open at weekends) I got a taxi from the airport to the hotel as I had some heavy luggage and the nearest rail station (Town Hall) is a 10 minute walk away. On arrival I eventually found the reception (upstairs on the first floor via the escalator) I didn't notice any signs, the concierge on the downstairs desk told me where it was. The nice lady at the airport told me that check in was at 2pm. I was early getting to the hotel (got there just before 1 pm) The hotel didnt seem overly busy and was a big place, so I was hopeful of getting to my room before 2pm and dumping my bags off. The reception staff were smiling and polite but sadly told me I couldnt check in early as 'My room wasn't ready'. However they told me I could leave my bags with the concierge who would take them straight up to my room as soon as it was ready. I made my way back down to the concierge on the ground floor, told them my name and room number and duly left my 3 suitcases with them, which they tagged up and gave me a receipt for. I then went for a walk around the surrounding streets. There were a myriad of pubs, restaurants (mostly Korean but a couple of Japanese) and plenty of convenience stores (most of which were open 24 hours and were well stocked) all within a couple of minutes from the hotel. I came back to the hotel about an hour later (bang on 2pm) and went up to reception. The same smiling Oriental receptionist lady that I had spoken to earlier told me that sadly my room still wasn't quite ready and to come back in about 15 minutes. 30 minutes later I came back and the same lady told me that my room was finally ready. I was on the 3rd floor. I had asked for a smoking room, and I got one. She rang concierge who said that my bags were on the way up. Lift access and room door activation are all controlled by card readers. I made my way up in the lift and followed signs to my room. I eventually managed to get in on the third attempt as my card didnt seem to work first time. this may have been error on my part as I didnt have any problems afterwards. On entering the room I was pleased to find it was a good size, nice and clean, King size bed, decent TV set and a nice ensuite bathroom with towels and complimentary soaps, shampoos etc etc I was less than impressed to find out that only 1 of my 3 items of luggage had made it to the room. I immediatley went down in the lift to ask the concierge where the other 2 were. We eventually found them locked up in a back room. I also quickly discovered that English wasn't this concierges first language. I took both my bags up to my room myself via the lift. Back in the room I decided to go outside on the balcony for a smoke. There were no chairs or tables outside and the balcony itself was very dirty. There were numerous discarded cigarette butts outside from the previous occupants, with lots of other garbage stuffed down the one drain hole in the middle of the balcony. The balcony itself was pretty grotty with a 'view' of the restaurant and down into a little alley that linked Pitt St with George St The room had the usual mini bar with the usual extortionate prices for bottles of water, beers etc etc, all crammed into a small fridge. I did what most people do, removed their items and replaced them with my own that I had bought from the local convenience store for about a quarter of the price, putting theirs back in unused on the morning of my departure. The room had a jug and complimentary tea and coffee. The room was serviced daily and all the items were replaced, together with fresh towels if required. There was a laundry room next to mine. This consisted of one old washer and one older dryer. Both these machines are coin operated. I think it was 3 bucks per wash and 3 bucks per drying cycle. There was a sign up to say not to use these machines after 8pm. I wasn't impressed with the washer and the dryer didnt give you long for your money. On the second day I just washed my stuff out in the sink or bath tub and rigged it up over the bath to dry out. (on one of those nifty retractable washing lines you only ever seem to find in Oz!) I can't comment on the food at the hotel as I didnt eat there. However each morning I noticed that most breakfast trays that were left outside peoples rooms for removal were largely untouched. Clientele at this hotel are a varied mix, from single travellers to couples, but by far the most usual guests seem to be cabin crew from Korean Air. Most mornings special buses would arrive to take them off to the airport, and bring others back later. General noise levels in my room were low, I had really good nights sleep and there was no real noise from traffic outside, drunks etc etc. The king size bed was really comfortable and the telly was excellent. The shower was hot and powerful (in a cubicle) and there was also a bath (which I washed my undies in) On the final morning of my stay I got up to see the bill shoved under my door for me to check before leaving. And what a good job I did check. I paid a cash deposit at the airport, this amount had not been taken off my final bill and they had charged me for 5 nights instead of 4. Once I pointed this out with reception they quickly amended it and I paid cash before checking out. To sum up.... I quite enjoyed staying here. However I have stayed in hotels in Sydney where the service has been much much better than the Rydges, the rooms have been better and the location much better for the Bridge, Opera House and the excellent Sydney Rail network. I would expect complimentary washers and dryers at least, (certainly if I paid the rack rate) although naturally I wouldn't mind providing my own laundry powder. Also I couldnt see any pool or spa at this hotel, I previously stayed at the excellent Meriton Apartments on Pitt St (just up the road) and it was heaps better than the Rydges. If you can get a good rate on wotif (or the lady at the Domestic terminal) then this place is probably worth a stay, otherwise try somewhere else.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location at a Great Price\u201d", "Author": "TweetyKwong", "ReviewID": "UR23023493", "Content": "We stayed 6 nights in a double double room.

I found the hotel to be pretty good up until this point with a nice business style standard about the premises. I doubt I would rate it 5 star when I compare it to the Sheraton, Westin, Park Hyatt etc but I felt it deserved a good 4.5 rating. The rooms were modern & functional without being luxurious and the check in experience and concierge were above average. We had a deluxe king room that was comfortable. We had a drink in the bar which is quite nice with pleasant surrounds. So overall they were travelling pretty well. Then came the stumble. We arrived at breakfast at 9.25 (with the buffett advertised to go to 10.30) and of the 8 or so warming bowls offering an assortment of hot food 5 where completly empty. No great problem so we enquired with the staff and where treated with absolute indifference. Several other guests also pointed this out with the same response. We were in the dining area for 40 mins and in that whole time the only thing they topped up was some hash browns. I counted 9 staff running around but yet you had guests sitting there eating toast and nothing else and these staff treating paying guests with disdain. The GM of this hotel should kick their behinds and remind them that it is these very guests who pay their salaries! I wouldn't have cared if everything was empty if one of two things happened: a) They were polite and arranged things to be refreshed or b) they were polite and offered to have something cooked fresh from the kitchen. Notice the key here is POLITE. Unfortunately bad service and practices are a reflection of the management and the GM has to wear it has his/her responibility to either belt the apathy out of them or terminate them immediately. Here is an idea terminate half of them put a rocket up the rest and I guarantee you tomorrow the apathy will be gone. Then to the final stumble. I check out and pay with my Amex, and to my disbelief they hit me with a surcharge. Now I have stayed at hotels all round the world and have never been hit with this charge. I would have thought the sort of corporate/well heeled guest is what you are trying to attract and these are the sort of people who carry Amex, so what do you do, accomodate them?? One would have thought that would be a good idea but not at Rydges - they spit at the very people they are trying to attract.

For the price paid, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I have stayed at this hotel before (and previously when it was known as the Avillion) - and enjoy its convenience to Central Station and Cinatown. After checking out, this is when my nightmare began. Two days after staying at the property, I noticed an anomilie with my Credit Card - for $110. As I was advised at check in that there was a $10 authorisation (or imprint) - I immediately checked with my bank, who informed me that Rydges World Square had an outstanding authorisation for $110. I immediately rang the hotel (late at night), asking for answers as to why the figure was so large, and how it could be reversed quickly. I was not given an answer why there was an authorisation for $110 - but was told the quickest way to reverse it was to put on a charge - and have the charge immediately reversed. I was asked if I would approve a $10 charge to be refunded immediately - for which I agreed. After I hung up, I checked my online statement - and my available balance had returned to normal. However, the next day, it was thrown out again - this time by $100.09. After calling my bank - I was informed that Rydges World Square had charged this amount to my account. It appears that the clerk who I spoke to (and who I authorised the transaction) somehow changed $10 to $100.09. Five days post stay (and four telephone calls later) this problem was finally rectified. On each occasion I had to make contact with Rydges - however they did try and email me - to a misspelt email address (even though I updated it upon check-in). One Representative who I spoke to suggested to me Rydges was not to fault - and that I probably had forgotten about a purchase I had made on my credit card!!! I have asked for an investigation to take place, and for a Manager to contact me direct regarding these incorrect/unauthorised transactions. So far I have heard nothing.

I asked if this included parking or breakfast and was told it didn't and therefore paid $20 pp for buffet breakfast. When we arrived we discovered there was an executive lounge and breakfast was provided. I am annoyed the lady didn't tell me this over the phone when I booked, and hence paid an extra $40. The room itself was lovely, the most comfortable bed I have ever stayed in (dream bed!), plasma tv, bath, high floors (19th), clean room and chockies, magazines and bathrobes! We visited the executive lounge for drinks before dinner and it was great! The service was wonderful and a fantastic variety of food and beverages! My only other complaint besides the breakfast was that our check in was 2pm and my partner arrived as I was shopping in the city and they wouldn't let him check in until I called up and added his name to the booking (annoying) then when I arrived half an hour later they wouldn't give me the room number or a room card. They then rang him and he had to come down and get me, even though the booking was in my name! (VERY ANNOYING!). Apart from that we had a lovely stay!

My first impressions were positive; I had just arrived in the early morning on a flight from London and I was very pleased that the checkin was so quick and painless. The room itself, while not particularly spacious, was quite comfortable and very clean. One wouldn't say that it was particularly opulent or outstandingly decorated but everything was in good condition and it was very easy to live with. There was a large LCD screen television as well, although the picture quality wasn't all that good. The bed was really very comfortable. The bathroom again was very clean and spacious, and everything worked well; I particularly liked the fact that there was a separate shower cubicle. The hotel provide toiletries on a daily basis which seemed to be of a good standard. The only thing which was slightly wrong with the room was that one of the catches on the window was slightly broken, meaning that the window let in a small amount of noise from the street. Being only two floors up from reception, and overlooking Pitt Street, there was sometimes a lot of noise outside. Besides that, the general colour scheme, particularly in the bathroom, looked a little bit tired. I used the hotel gym regularly. There is an adequate range of equipment, which, however, seemed to be little used by guests, so there was never any problem with using it. Breakfast was the only meal I took in the hotel. At weekends, this costs AU$18, which, I suppose, is a reasonable price for a capital city hotel, but this goes up to $32 for the full breakfast during the week, which to me seems like a lot. In any case, there is a good range of food available to suit most people. The only problem I had with breakfast was that it was sometimes difficult to get a first or second cup of coffee from the staff who walk the floor; they don't seem to notice some tables.

The location is in the heart of the CBD and has connections to just about anywhere you wanted to go. The front desk people were very professional and accomodating. Especially since I arrived in Sydney at 7:30 am only to find (understandably) that my reserved King room was not ready. I was SO tired that I asked the nice man behind the desk if I could upgrade to a suite for a few nights. He found me a suite but that room was not ready also. Later on we found out that the whole city was sold out because of a big concert, a few major rugby games plus it was student holiday! It was remarkable that they even found me a room. I checked my bags with conceirge and left for only one hour. I came back to find my bags checked into my room and was ready to go! The suites are beautiful except for the room I got has two bathrooms, which is great except the first one by the front door smelled SO badly that I had to close the door and not use it. It smelled like sewage. I don't know what the problem was but I was not going to complain, since there were no other rooms for me to go into. With your executive suite, you also get access to an executive lounge which twice a day would offer a complimentary breakfast and in the evening a happy hour with wine/beer and appetizers. It had to be the best deal in town. The food was excellent and the lounge was peaceful and quiet. Even when they were not open officially for happy hour, you were allowed to go into the room, with your hotel room key and they would leave snacks out for you, like cookies or fruit. That was a highlight of extra customer service and for a room that was not that much more. The only problem we had was one night there were loud kids at the dance bar across street that kept us up until 4 am. That was the only complaint. If you book a room ask for a room on the higher level floor. You won't hear so much street noise. I'd stay there again. WE were able to walk everywhere plus there is a shopping mall on a lower level right under the hotel. It has a small grocery store and liquor store, plus a japanese market and food booths if you didn't feel like going out. I would like to see Sydney in their summer next time.", "Date": "August 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cNoisy and Basic\u201d", "Author": "FreqBusTraveller88", "ReviewID": "UR8282007", "Content": "I have stayed at this Rydges (previously Avillion) four times. The first 2 times I was in a small, basic room (for close to $AU200 per night) near noisy airconditioning machinery and I got some sleep. When I made my third reservation, I asked for a room away from the very noisy adjoining streets, and got a room on a noisy street opposite what sounded like an Irish pub. I was then moved to another room and this was above the railway station so it sounded like trains were rumbling through my room all through the night and I got very little sleep which does not help when one has a fullon business day the next day. On the morning f my second night of the stay, I spoke with the polite Duty Manager and was moved to a quiet room and had a great sleep. I booked into the hotel again (silly me you may say but the location is very convenient) and again asked for a quiet room. Guess what - I went through the exactly the same reservation and checkin process as above, even meeting with the same Duty Manager on day 2. Nothing had changed In addition to this, the bathrooms were basic. On 1 stay the showerhead was broken; on subsequent stays there were empty boxes, 2 of one product and none of another, no towel for the floor etc. The room service food, too, is horrible - don't order expensive room service. This is a noisy, expensive, basic hotel and my star rating for it would be 2 or 3 stars. I also get the impression that they do not listen to their customers and don't really care. I am booked to go to Sydney at the end of August and have booked into the Meriton Apartments near by.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cBad Experience\u201d", "Author": "Britboyscott", "ReviewID": "UR8272711", "Content": "I had used the Avillion to house myself and company staff (I buy about 5,000 room nights a year), so was happy to take my mother along for a stay on her way overseas. The room we were allocated was unlike any I had stayed in previously. Extremely small, dirty carpets, torn curtain, dusty with drainage problems. Here is an example of how important the front staff are to a hotel - when I called to see if there may a room in line with others I had stayed in on many occassions, the front desk member insisted that all rooms were the same size. I drew to his attention the fllorplan on the back of the door, but he insisted I had not stayed in premier room but a suite (I stay in hotels at least 8 months a year so know the difference). I did receive a call from the Rooms Division Manager who was very upset about it. I did say I would call next time I stayed which I haven't done Unfortunately as we were trying to sleep, at about 1am there was screaming outside the door by a drunk guest, then a 15 minute struggle with the police resulting in a very disturbed sleep. A cold, substandard breakfast followed the next morning. I detailed this in a hotel survey, but have not received a response. I think the Rooms Division Manager should perhaps become the GM!

It was clean enough but not spotless, the bathrooms could do with a good scrub. We did have a problem in the first room we were put into with the air conditioning noise and the duty manager dealt with that very promptly and willingly. The second room was much larger, cleaner, and more modern fittings but would still not be rated as a 5 star hotel. Location was handy to Darling Harbour and Central city.
