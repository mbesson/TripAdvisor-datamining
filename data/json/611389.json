The staff did not speak English but they tried their very best which was nice but very frustrating. They were very friendly and sweet nonetheless. Please remember to bring outlet converters/adapters. And the reviews that were posted were very helpful. The views are stunning, the rooms clean, but really you get a bed and a washroom, nothing else. There is not even a phone in the room and if you are use to using washcloths, bring your own because they do not have any. There is a small 13in TV but there is only Italian channels. They will tell you that there is English ones but there is not. There is MTV and that only has English sometimes. Breakfast was toast (the size of crackers) tea and coffee. No water-oh and if you do not want club or seltzer water remember to say flat/still water. The best feature is that the bus is literally right outside the hotel and runs until 11 on most nights. There is nothing, I mean nothing to do locally so be prepared to use the bus often. Even the resteraunts that were close had sketchy hours and was hardly open. Load up on drinks and snacks at the grocery stores that the bus can take you to. Its the 32. We did finally catch the Le Isle resteraunt but they spoke no English and the menu was in Italian. Needless to say we ordered French Fries. lol. Oh and one day they do not serve meat so be sure to check. The church bells next door was very nice. If you are going to Rome for the food please be ready to be disappointed. The pizza is not like American pizza and the food is not that great. The wine was great though! we met great friends from NC at the hotel so this was a blessing. Take a day trip to Pompeii on your own. It is cheaper and you are not committed to stay with a tour. We were going to pay $300 for 2 for tour but we did it on our own by just taking the 32 bus into the terminal and then the train into Naples and then Pompeii. It was about $100 for the both of us. The same with the Collesum. It was $24 for 2. We paid about $120 for two online. Oh and ATM wills not let you get money from your savings just so you know. We found out the hard way. ; ). I hope this helps someone and God Bless.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bielsko-Biala, Poland", "Title": "\u201cWe had a really relaxing stay; just what we needed!\u201d", "Author": "Benjamin R", "ReviewID": "UR127373286", "Content": "Another reviewer mentions being away from the hectic city life. He's absolutely bang-on. This hotel requires a bit of effort to get to, being fairly removed from the centre of Rome.

The staff are not merely polite; they are just delightful! Friendly, cheerful, and full of suggestions for a day of wandering that took us to places we wouldn't have found in a guidebook.

Follow the instructions provided by the hotel and get off at the very last stop on the bus (right at the top of a hill) and you will be rewarded by some of the kindest staff and truly spectacular views. The room was lovely, and the free and fast wifi was an extra treat.

Located not far from dowtown (with a public transportation bus stop conveniently located right in front of the hotel), it is a genuine Italian hotel-not a touristy/commercialized one. The setting is in a quiet, secluded, and historic (across from a Church built in the 1400's) area. It is a family owned./ run hotel which has been in the hands of the same Italian family for generations. There is a restaurant conveniently located on site that serves some of the best authentic Italian food at a reasonable price. They make the best Pizza Margarita in all of Rome! But, by far, the hotel's greatest attribute is its service. The staff is friendly, courteous, and helpful-always greeting its patrons with a big smile. They are very accomodating, trying to meet their guest every need (for example,Italians don't use ice-but when I requested it , they went out immediately and bought some). Because of its small size, guest get personalized attention. An added blesing is to meet and wperience the glowing personalities of its owner family. First, you are officially greeted by the Mother Doninica, who has the biggest smile and brightest welcoming eyes in Italy. Simone (the hotel manager) and Egeo (restaurant manager), have the most oout-going, positive,and professional behaviour. They both release a flow of excitement and energy to the stay (its worth the trip just to meet these two-they're characters in the most positive/thrilling way). So, as an expert in international real estate/vacation properties, I can say this is one of the best hotels in Rome and the whole World!", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cA terrible experience\u201d", "Author": "car1nyc", "ReviewID": "UR72326085", "Content": "Came to stay; the room was hot and stinky, with a humid feel all around.
