I booked the hotel through Air Miles and it more than lived up to my expectations. Our flight landed around 5 pm and we decided to take the train into Barcelona rather than getting a taxi. The train cost 6 euro 15 cents and took about 30 mins. We got off at Passeig de Gracia and the hotel is only a couple of minutes walk. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and soon had us checked in. We hired a safe box at a cost of 5 euro a night which I dont think is too bad. We were on the second floor and had a double room with a small room to the side with a single bed in. We were overlooking the main road but noise was not a problem. The room was very nice and clean and there was maid service daily. The only thing that was missing was tea and coffee making facilities which are usually included in hotel rooms. The breakfasts were buffet style - cereals, yoghurts, cold meats and plenty of pastries and the staff in the breakfast room were very friendly. The hotel is well placed for sightseeing - just a couple of minutes walk from Casa Batllo and about a 10 minute stroll to Plaza de Catalunya and the sight seeing buses. We also strolled down the Ramblas to the Port area which is also well worth a visit, We did the sight seeing bus - we bought a 2 day ticket which was well worth the money 30 euro as opposed to 23 euro for a one day ticket. We also did the Nou Camp stadium and took the cable car across the harbour which was fab - 10 euro for a 1 way journey. Park Guell is brilliant and another must do. We also liked Port Vell and the marina and managed to take in a stroll on the beach as it was t shirt weather. There are some lovely Tapas restaurants just minutes from the hotel. We had a fab time and would definately return to Barcelona and this hotel. We took the aero bus back to the airport - it was slightly more expensive than the train but only a couple of euros more but it only took about 15 minutes.

Our non-smoking room was clean and everything worked. There was no information about the safe though, which you pay 4 euro a day for. We also had to ask for the bed linen to be changed after 4 days. I thought that most hotels did this every day, but perhaps not in Spain. It wasn't an issue anyway - we left a note for the housekeeping staff and they were changed right away. Problem solved. It did get a bit noisy being in a room close to the stairwell, but not to the point where we couldn't sleep, and that was the fault of the other guests and not the hotel. Breakfast was a continental buffet style, staff were pleasant and polite and very tolerant when people (like us) turned up 10 minutes before they stopped serving. The food was good - a wide range of fresh bread, cheese, meats, fruit, cereals, pastries. It was included when we booked, otherwise I might have been tempted to find cheaper alternatives. As it was paid for though, we enjoyed it and it was convenient to have it there in the hotel. The Taber's location was excellent. We spent a lot of time down in the Barri Gotic, but it was good to escape to the slightly quieter end of town when the day was done. The hotel is a short walk from the main square Placa de Catalunya, and they have a room where you can store your luggage after checkout if you have a while before your flight.

I would definitely recommend this hotel. We had a quiet room facing a courtyard. Our room was clean, comfortable and pleasant. We were able to get a non-smoking room. The rooms were comfortably air-conditioned and odor-free. The reception area was very modern. Although the hotel apparently has free WiFi, if you do not have your own laptop internet access was fairly expensive. After dark, there is a security guard stationed at the door which increased our sense of safety. Perhaps the best thing about the hotel was its excellent location. The streets around the hotel are very busy during the day but are relatively quiet at night. (I definitely would not want to stay at any hotel located in the Raval.) The HCC Taber is a block from a major metro station that offers train access to the airport. It is situated less than half a block from the start of La Rambla and is a ten minute walk down La Rambla to Place de Catalunya. One of the best shopping streets in Barcelona, Passeig de Gracia, is only one block away (running parallel to La Rambla). This means that there are many restaurants, cafes, pastry shops and clothing stores nearby. The two major hop on hop off tour bus companies both have stops on Passeig de Gracia about 2-3 blocks from the hotel, which was also very convenient. I would definitely stay at the HCC Taber again and would highly recommend it.

The desk people didn't know how to say sorry, how to smile or how to be willing to help. The location is good, the room is pretty clean, but the breakfast also was the worst.
