The location of this hotel is excellent and only took us about 5/10 mins to walk to the main square and La Ramblas. We had a family room at the back of the hotel and had no outside noise whatsoever. Room was spacious with a lovely bathroom, free safe and free laptop which came in very handy. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and happy to store our cases adnd bags for a few hours after we had checked out at no extra charge. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was very expensive (10 euros person), but found a large variety of restaurants/cafes very near to the hotel serving pastries, coffee, toast, etc etc which were much cheaper. I would say that although well designed with some very quirky touches, the rooms could use a bit of an update, but this is a very minor grumble and we would happily stay here again in the future. Word of advice for anyone who hasn't visited Barcelona before - don't eat or drink on La Ramblas, as it is VERY expensive.

Unfortunately our stay coincided with the strikes and riots that happened for one day/night so we were unable to leave the hotel that evening. It was a shame not to head out, but the hotel room was spacious and because we had treated ourselves to a stay in a suite, we had a lovely private outdoor terrace with hot tub. We had to order room service that evening (as most restaurants were shut due to the general strike) and the food took nearly an hour and a half to arrive and was very disappointing when it did turn up. We actually sent back the sandwiches as they were totally dried up. We put the bad food down to it being an extraordinary evening where probably most guests were ordering in. The hotel is in a fabulous location, just around the corner from Las Ramblas and a few blocks down to the Placa Catalunya. We also walked to the Sagrada Familia on our first day (due to the blockades of the central roads) which took about 40 minutes but was a nice stroll. The hotel itself was fine, not the fanciest place I've ever stayed, but definitely not the worst. It felt like a fancy designer had designed the hotel, but the finish was looking a bit tired and in need of a refresh. We had the breakfast which was your standard pastries, cereal, toast, fruit and some cooked food. It was OK. Whilst the room was clean, we were very disappointed to find a used condom left by the side of the hot tub on our second night. Obviously it really put us off and rather ruined the romance of having your own private hot tub! Hotel staff need to check for this in the future as it's probably the thing that most sticks in my mind about the stay - for all the wrong reasons! All rooms have a laptop which is a nice touch and we also got wifi codes so we could access the internet on smart phones etc. There is a safe in the room and toiletries, hairdryer etc in the bathroom.

Probably the thing that gave the unwelcoming feeling was the ultra dark lobby and a front desk staff that never even looked up from the computer or paperwork as guests came and went.

From Terminal 1, I took the complimentary green bus to Terminal 2. There, just outside the entrance, a convenient A2 bus cost only 5.30 Euros to bring me right to the city center near the Universitat de Barcelona in about 30 minutes. From the bus stop, it was a short stroll to the 4 star plus Hotel Petit Palace Museum at 250 C/Deputacio. I really recommend this high tech and modern hotel when you visit Barcelona. The staff are very helpful and friendly with a cool reception that looks like a studio of modern art. My cheery room was very well equipped with multi-coloured psychedelic furniture, and they even loan you a Dell laptop computer with complimentary internet access. As a bonus, the bathtub has a jacuzzi to soak away your jet lag, plus there is also an exercise bicycle provided for you to work out. I always find a good work out burns calories and fights jet lay at the same time. They also have a Sauna and small Gym in the basement. Yummy Desayunos (Breakfast) Breakfast buffet is served from 7am to 10.30am. The spread from cereals to fruit juices, yoghurt, Jamon (ham), Chorizo sausage, scrambled eggs , pastries, tarte tatin, pain au chocolate, tomato flatbread which you make yourself and fresh fruit is excellent! There is even Cava, Spain's answer to champagne for breakfast! The location of this hotel is very good. Nearby are many small restaurants and Tapas bars. Some cater to the Barcelona University students so they are not expensive. I had lunch during my stay at the Piscolabis Tapas Restaurant near the hotel. Adrian, the Manager made me welcome and in next to no time, I was feasting on L\u2019Escala Anchovy & Bonito Montadito, ueber-crispy paper thin Tomato bread, potato Croquettes that looked like cute bolsters stuffed with Iberian Acorn Ham and Burrito filled with diced chicken, guacomole and melted cheese. Very tasty and satisfying! From the hotel it is just a short walk to the Placa de Catalunya which is the heart of Barcelona. Here you will see splendid fountains and greedy pigeons plus lots of people both locals as well tourists. From the Placa de c Catalunya it only took 10 minutes to walk to La Rambla. This famous pedestrian shopping center boasts many traditional stalls selling Spanish Turron (nougat) with almonds and hazelnuts, flowers, souvenirs, waffles with chocolate sauce and ice cream! There are also many street performers dressed in outlandish costumes that stand so still they appear to be sculptures\u2026until they suddenly move! From La Rambla, I ambled over to the renowned and very historic gothic Catedral de Barcelona.The history and culture of this city impressed me greatly. I also dropped in on the surreal Salvador Dali Museum. Pillow Fight! One evening, making my way back to the Hotel Petit Palace Museum, I arrived at the Placa de Catalunya. The clock struck 6pm and suddenly hordes of laughing teenagers and even older people started attacking each other with all manner of pillows until the feathers flew like clouds of snow flakes! It was very boisterous and good natured as the pillow fighters shrieked and squeeled with happy laughter. Your trip whether for business or pleasure always goes well when you stay in a good hotel!

So they grabbed a cab and checked in over there. Petite Palace was away from things and you have to take taxis to see anything. We walked back to it from the Las Ramblas one of the days and it was a trek. Not recommended for and 82 year as was my Mom. We were not happy to find out that it was not as close as they let you believe. We booked a triple room and it was tiny. There were 3 twin beds basically all in a row pushed together. And they were not comfortable either. The colors in the room were whites and greys sort of dark and dreary. The lighting was terrible!! The bathroom had a nice big shower with lots of shower heads if you had the time to figure them all out we did not. We had a view of the street but basically it was a high end shopping district which isn't what we were into at the time. Front desk service was ok, nobody gave us a warm welcome. Very business like and no smiles. When we visited our travelling companions at the Petit Palace Opera Garden having to get there by taxi. We were dropped off say midway down the La Ramblas area to their hotel. We were so envious when we saw where it was. Their mistake turned into a blessing in disguise. They were in a much better location than we were right in the heart of La Ramblas! And they paid about the same price as oursl. The Petit Palace Opera Garden sat right in the alley 2 stores away from the main drag of La Ramblas. But when I say alley it was an alley/street filled with all of these great shops and restaraunts galore right at the doorstep that ran into all of these other great streets They were endless! The rooms at their hotel were big and bright and light with whites and yellows. A big difference in feel and more comfortable looking. The hotel was very unique. So my review on Petite Palace don't do it. Stay at Petit Palace Opera Garden instead you will be very pleased. (But beware!!! my Aunt staying had her purse pickpocketed down that same alley way. But not blaming the hotel at all for this at all. They warn you about it and it happened to us. My aunt was carrying a backpack and we were down the alley shopping and my Mom saw her purse was open and her things were falling out. So she looked and her wallet and passport were gone. So don't carry your passport while out either. But her only reason for carrying it was they just checked in and rushed out to see the great shops and forgot to take it out before leaving the hotel. LUCKILY after having to go file a police report after getting back somebody found her passport in front of one of the shops. It really was a MIRACLE that somebody found it that quick and that she was able to fly home the next day. So please take this to heart and believe it really does happen.)", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middelburg", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "eric61", "ReviewID": "UR63567127", "Content": "A Perfect hotel on the Diputacion in Barcelona.

There is also a flatscreen TV. We really liked the interior design, it's modern and you feel a bit like you live in a designer hotel. What doesn't make this hotel/room 5-stars is the fact that if something isn't perfect or has been worn out, it won't be replaced. For example the hip chair in our room had \"dirty\" fabric and the wallpaper was coming off in one corner of the room. If you're not picky like me though, you won't even notice (I'm sure my boyfriend didn't) and it does not make the stay less nice. The outdoor terrace is amazing. It is actually larger than the room itself and has nice sunbeds, cool lights and a beautiful jacuzzi which was heated to a nice temperature. I would definitely want the same room if I returned. There is even a palmtree plant. The toilet is very nice and modern. The shower area is very large and it has a hip shower. I suppose the fact that there is a glass door as a door would be bothering if you don't you know the person you share your room with. The staff isn't unfriendly at all, but on the other doesn't go out of their way to make your stay perfect. While we were there we got some cava, grapes (a Spanish tradition) and sweets for free which was very nice though. This is not meant to be a complaint, but if you value personal service a lot, I'm not sure this hotel is for you.

However, when you have seen around the city, you soon realise the main gift this hotel has is it's location. I cannot see how you could possibly get a better one. Barca itself is fantastic. If i could give 3 bits of advice for staying in Barca it would be 1) stay in Eixample - it's a great part of the city being central and really nice. 2) Don't get too excited about La Rambla - it's good but there are plenty of other places in the city. 3) Get the 2 day tourist bus ticket - can't do the city any better. Overall, a fantastic place.

The hotel was one of the nicest and best value for money that I have stayed in, and we loved the modern room with the chic decor and extras such as the laptop with free internet connection, the ipod dock, the flat screen tv and the hydro-massage shower. There was also a free safe in the room which just required you to swipe any magnetic card other than the room card to activate it. The room was also very comfortable and clean, with daily maid service. The only fault was that we were allocated in a room where the whole bathroom was modified with disabled rails, meaning we didn't have the normal bathroom units as shown in the hotel photos and had a very low sink. We didn't see this as a big problem considering all of the plus points of the room. Aside from the rooms, the hotel was in a fantastic location, with 3 metro stops within very close walking distance, and Playa Catalunya only a 5 minute walk away. This was very convenient for getting the Aerobus to and from the airport at roughly $7.50 return, which ran every 10 minutes or so. The area itself was very modern with lots of boutique shops and good restaurants. Las Ramblas was roughly a 10 minute walk away, several of Gaudi's attractions such as Parc Guell were within walking distance and everything else was easily accessible on the metro. Overall it was a great stay and we would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona. Unfortunately we weren't blessed with the best of weather on our trip, with it raining for one of the days, therefore I would be tempted at some point to return to Barcelona in the middle of Summer and would stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Posh Essex girl", "Title": "\u201cFab hotel\u201d", "Author": "auntytoe", "ReviewID": "UR27635808", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here from 3rd-6th April 2009.

Bizarrely there was an exercise bike in the room that needless to say we didn't use but there was a computer with free internet access and an iPod dock. Large king size bed (not two beds put together). We didn't do breakfast as it seemed too expensive but we recommend a little bakery/cafe over the road called La Rambla 31. The hotel staff were very friendly. We got a bus from the airport to Placa Catalunya and walked 3 or 4 blocks - is fine if you don't have too much luggage. This is much cheaper than getting a taxi. The buses arrrive every 6 mins so it really is the best way from the aiport - check out the getting there and away section for Barcelona for more info. P.S. I preferred staying here in the L'Eixample area rather than the narrow streets of Gothic Quarter off la Rambla.

The large, LCD screen TV, Ipod stock, laptop with high speed connection, all included in the room rate. Some of the technology is a little on the new and untested side.

Excellent water pressure from a ceiling mounted showerhead, handheld one and the hydro massage on a wall. Bathroom door is only frosted glass, so anyone that needs to feel privacy from their roommate may not like this. They provide some nice extras like toothbrush (which I forgot home) body lotion and after shave. The lounge area looked cozy and inviting, the music was good and the waitress in bar made some very tasty cocktails. I have to say that they could really use some pianist to play the piano some evening to make it more crosier atmosphere. I didn't need to interact too much with the front desk, but they were very nice on check-in and checkout and always said hello when I came or left. The guy in reception during a night time remembered my name and greeted me by my name every time I passed and was very attentive with suggestions what to do and where to go.

Barcelona has always been my favourite Spanish city and every time I go there it has something new to offer. This time the most memorable and newest experience was our hotel. Petit palace Museum is worth every single penny and even more when to take to consideration that the hotel front desk staff will do almost anything for you just to make your stay memorable. I fell in love with this hotel and the staff from the moment we checked in. The hotel has been opened just a year or so and it gives you kind a atmosphere you don't find elsewhere in Barcelona. its funky, stylish, minimal chic, classy , modern, comfortable and just wonderful. The rooms have been styled with a guest comfort in mind and the room amenities are just everything you could wish for. The beds are comfortable, big and the linen is soft. The Plasma TV, the laptop, The Ipod centre and alarm centre, and the most amazing is bathroom. I was not bothered with the frosty class door, as I believe it is just more lightening from usual claustrofhobic small bathrooms. We had room service also and the service was quick and the food hot and very tasteful. Also a plus to the hotel is to remember their clients on New Years Eve with complimentary Champagne and grapes ( Spanish tradition to have to eat 12 grapes on midnight) The common areas all clean, end spacious, with extra internet point located in lobby. The stylish lobby bar and the cellar restaurant where you could have your breakfast every morning. I would also like to mention the front desk staff who were helpful and helped us with shopping advice, tourist advice, with restaurant bookings and taxis. The guy ( I believe from Scandinavia) who was working during a night kept us entertained with amazing stories every evening and made us feel like we were home and not in hotel. Even to serve us 2am morning a cup of tea and give us opinions and suggestions for the day planning it was very nice of him. Sorry but I can not remember your name to thank you personally. And personal thank you to Maria, our angel who took care of us on mornings with her charming Spanish/English and warm smile.

Excellent location, blocks away from everything you want to see. Simple to get to/from BCN, take the Blue bus from the airport to Plaza Catalunya (last stop) and walk about two blocks up and over (will take you 5-10 min). Buy the return ticket for about 7 Euros from the driver. The ticket machine at the airport bus stop requires exact change so just buy from driver (like everyone else). If you need to get oriented at the bus stop just ask the driver. We also had a map. So simple and cheaper than a taxi. Also there are Metro stops right around the corner. Room was not as big as those shown in some of the pictures. Probably a little bit bigger than the avg Euro hotel room but well planned. High ceilings. Clean and comfortable. Bathroom was nice and shower was excellent. Walk-in shower! No need to pole vault into the tub here as you do with most showers in Europe. Excellent water pressure and temperature. Other reviews suggest this may have been a problem in the past. In my travels, I have experienced a variance in water pressure/temp depending on when I shower and try to avoid peak shower times (as you would in a private home). I did notice that on the water on/off, is like a kitchen faucet, left/right=temp, out/up controls the pressure. I just mention it as my husband didn't know at first how to control the pressure. There's a frosted decal on the glass bathroom door now (or was in our room) for privacy. Looks like they responded to feedback. Thought that the snakeskin pattern tile in the bathroom was a neat ode to Gaudi as well as the picture on the bathroom door decal. Loved having a laptop with internet access in the room. Even with our guidebooks we found ourselves looking stuff up at the last minute. A-plus addition to the hotel experience. Didn't eat at the hotel but they did have room service and a restaurant. There's a little space in the mini-fridge for your water etc. Didn't use the phone. Didn't ask for help, but the front desk staff seemed happy and helpful and spoke English, and were patient with our poor Spanish. Cleaning staff was very nice and did a great job. Ordered a wake-up call which came at the proper time. They did have a clock/radio with alarm but I unplugged as the buttons are somewhat lit and the light bothered me. Strange how sensitive to light I can be when everything is dark. There were other people staying at the hotel but we never heard our neighbors. They either have excellent sound proofing or spaced us out considerably. I saw people in the lobby and on the elevator and even on our floor but didn't hear anyone within the room. Room was a bit warm (even after we monkeyed with temp control), we opened the window. You hear the occasional street noise or noise from people on the terraces but nothing that kept me up (I'm a light sleeper). Bed was clean and comfortable. On the firm side. Linens are very good quality, soft. Extra pillow in the cupboard/closet. No luggage rack. There's room on top of the cupboard for luggage but no collapsible luggage rack to put your bag on while unpacking. We used the chair to pack/unpack. No coffee/tea tray in room but Starbucks was open on Christmas morning! Excellent place to stay. We're fairly picky. We will stay here again and will checkout the other High Tech Hotels. Can't say enough nice things about our stay. You get full value and beyond for your money. Don't write reviews but felt compelled to do so about this place.

The staff was helpful and very nice, you could even play a piano in the reception (almost like everything's allowed). Very modern design, but comforting at the same time (some of High Tech chain is a little too modern). Great room, very beautiful, huge bed. Big bathroom with jacuzzi bath, equipped with champoo and bath gel, and also a comb, dryer, etc. I did not hear any neighbors, drilling, or whatever I read in other reviews. Absolutely quiet. This hotel is ideal for single travelers, however I imagine it can be good for any business travelers and tourists, for travelers with pets, for couples and honeymooners. Minuses: small wardrobe, the balcony door did not close and nobody cared, neither me, although I informed the reception. Pluses: everything else. I reserved it on the hotel website, paying in total in advance (it was the best price on internet), and I paid 155 euros per night.", "Date": "May 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique you won't regret\u201d", "Author": "spunge411", "ReviewID": "UR15070064", "Content": "Stayed here in a quad room last week.

We didn't use the hotel breakfast, there are about 5 places for coffee and pastries/eggs within 1 min walk and one block to the left of the hotel is a bar, that never seemed to close :) And if you want to walk a maximum of 5 mins for a great breakfast in a local setting, there is the world famous La Boqueria.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London,UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place!\u201d", "Author": "loony44", "ReviewID": "UR13825393", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel last week with my husband, daughter (5) and son (3). I am really fussy when it comes to hotels and holidays and research like crazy. This hotel did not fail to impress! We decided to take a taxi from El Prat airport to the hotel and it took 15 minutes and cost \u20ac14 (this was at lunchtime). The taxi pulled up and we were 'wow!'. The hotel is very stylish. Reception staff were very friendly and checked us in quickly and efficiently. We went to our room and it was enormous! We had a family room so had a double bed plus bunkbeds. The kids loved the bunk beds as they had their own little tv sets with cartoons. Our room had 2 large wardrobes, a minibar, safe (free), large TV and laptop with free fast internet access. The bathroom was also very big and had a stylish handbasin, hairdryer, toilet and large bath with hydroshower. The water was piping hot and very powerful and was an absolute joy. There was a step to help people get in and out of the bath and plenty of places to put your soap and shower gel. The breakfast would have cost us \u20ac16 per person per day but we found a lovely Spanish cafe just 1 minute away (La Tramoia) where we ate and it only cost a TOTAL of \u20ac14 ( we had juice, coffee, toast and croissants for 4 people). The hotel is in a great location - only 2 blocks from Placa Catalunya and the top of La Rambla. It took only 5 minutes to walk here. The Placa Catalunya is where the tourist bus starts and we took a 2 day ticket on this and used this as our transport in Barcelona. It took us everywhere we wanted to go and we just got off and on at each place. The kids loved it, too, especially sitting upstairs on the opentop and enjoying the warm sunshine. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. It was stylish, quiet, great location, friendly helpful staff. The negative points that people have mentioned in previous reviews have all been taken care of by the hotel ( I presume they read this and take note?). The water was hot and powerful, there was a step and rail to get in shower/bath, the elevator didn't creak, the lobby was all one level so no little bits to trip over. Will definitely be staying here if we ever return to Barcelona!", "Date": "February 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luxembourg", "Title": "\u201cI will be back\u201d", "Author": "eischen", "ReviewID": "UR13605796", "Content": "Have been here for one night and it has been very good.

Close to Placa de Cataluna and at some distance of the other purely touristic places. A good starting point. Will defenitely go back. This is a chain hotel.

We booked a room there because we could put all 4 members of my family (two adults, two teens) in one family room. This is really hard to find in Spain without resorting to renting an apartment. When we arrived, we were so pleased to find out that they had upgraded us to a junior suite upon discovering that it was my husband's birthday on our check-in date. Our room had a 6-person hot tub and a huge, walk-in shower. The hotel was sleek and had a trendy boutique feel. We had plenty of room to spread out and wished we were staying longer instead of leaving for Madrid the next day. The hotel is located in a nice part of town, but is not near Las Ramblas, if that is what you are looking for. It was fairly quiet. When our son did something (!) to the toilet and caused it to run constantly, they sent up a maintenance person and had it fixed within the hour. The front desk personnel were friendly, welcoming and helpful. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to any traveller.
