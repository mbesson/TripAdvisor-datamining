Now, the breakfast! If the room seemed expensive to me (it actually wasn't when compared to other high ranking hotels on Tripadvisor), the feast of a breakfast made the stay a real bargain.

Each morning we were served a delicious Dutch breakfast that consisted of juice, tea or coffee, cereal, yoghurt, jam and Mary's home-made bread and special omelettes or eggs and bacon. The Hotel Keizershof is within easy walking distance of all historic sites, including the Rijksmuseum, the Van Gogh Museum, the Coster Diamonds Museum, Dam Square and the Amsterdam flower market. There are also some delightful pubs, great restaurants and little eateries nearby. We were staying at the Hotel Keizershof when there was an eruption at Eyjafjallaj\u00c3\u00b6kull, Iceland on April 17. This meant that we were unable to fly home on 18th April. Mary, her daughter Hanneke and son Ernest did all they could to keep us up-to-date with the latest developments each day. The Hotel Keizershof became our 'home away from home' and the De Vries family 'our family' who cared and comforted us until we were finally able to get on a flight home 3 days later. When it came time to go, we were genuinely sorry to leave and will be forever grateful for the kindness that was shown to us during that time. So, if you all looking for a real Dutch family experience, look no further! The De Vries family are waiting to welcome you to their hotel. What are you waiting for? Go on, book it and I hope like us, you'll find that a stay at Hotel Keizershof is a MOST delightful experience!

We found a Dutch cell phone on our first day and they were very helpful in translating the phone info and were able to contact the owner and secure it's safe return. This time was above and beyond they obligation, but they were delightful to assist. Our room (Marlene Detrich Room on the 3rd floor) was large with a sink, table and chairs and a tv. We had a lovely view of their garden. The breakfasts were grand!!! Mary, the mother, provided us with numerous choices, toast, buns, caramel filled wafers, cornflakes, musleix, cheeses, fresh and dried fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea and a daily hot option. One day we had dutch pancakes with fresh strawberries and nutella. The second day we had cheese omlettes with chives. The third we had to leave early to catch the train on `easter. The son kindly gave us a bag of chocolate Easter cookies. We never had any cookie as good before. Each day they gave us tips on things to do and where to go. And they even shared their living space in the evening. We had a great time sharing stories about travel, family and their B&B business. Now we feel obligated to address the stairs. We stayed on the 3rd floor and did not struggle with the stairs. We expected stairs in Europe. And the twist, just made them more charming. If anyone has trouble with them, they may need to consider less luggage. If you do want to stay here and are concerned about the stairs book early and get the room on the 1st floor.

I liked what I saw on the internet for Hotel Keizershof, and since the exchange rate for the Canadian Dollar was poor at the time, I simply wrote and asked if they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be willing to give me a discount. They agreed, and I was delighted with the rate they offered. When we got there, however, they looked at us blankly and claimed I had led them to believe I had LITTLE children. Though I felt sure I had included the ages of my children, I could not be 100% certain because I had written to so many places. I simply apologized and hoped they would let us stay since my 15 year old felt ill and barely made it there. I was carrying his luggage and mine! They begrudgingly let us in but made it clear that they were unhappy about us. We felt most unwelcome. In an effort to be just I offered to pay more. For the 3 nights we were there my children hardly ate any breakfast, and on one day my 15 year old didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat at all because he was so ill. At my request our hostess didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t change any linen or do anything in the room for the day he was ill in bed. That negated her arguments that older children eat more and use more water. I was kindly permitted to use her computer and internet to contact my husband to let him know we arrived safely, but she sat and watched what I wrote, so I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel free to check up the email I had written to her to see if I had included the ages of my children. However, I did check after we left Amsterdam, and I had most clearly stated their ages! My husband wrote to her, pointing out how unwelcome we felt and that the $150 I had paid on top of the price she had offered us really was uncalled for since I had been upfront about their ages, but of course we never heard back. I was really disappointed. I had given her the benefit of the doubt and tried to be fair and honest but she did not return that courtesy. Next time I will take copies of all agreements along. About the room: it opens to the canal. Very noisy at night. All the sounds seem to echo up, especially the carts on cobblestone at 4 am. The people cruising down the canal with their stereos on can be clearly heard, as can conversations. Bring ear plugs and a big mosquito net. It folds quite small into a suitcase, but comes in really handy frequently in Europe, since many places don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have screens or air conditioning. And yes, the staircase is as bad as everyone says it is. Large suitcases would simply not fit! Breakfast was varied. The hostess wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feeling well while we were there, so I was offered an omelet once and on one day her daughter made one for only two of about 12 people, but the rest of us didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get an offer, and we were finished eating by the time she had finished those omelets.

It sounded very historic, in a good location and that people enjoyed staying there b/c of the great breakfast and great hospitality. Unfortunately, this was not our experience at all. My boyfriend and I were travelling Europe, it was his first time, my upteenth..or so. The hotel was as expected. We were warned about the stairs and the travel up, so i did't expect to have any help or warning with that, but the stairs are very narrow and steep, so travel light, or be ready for a strong work out. The rooms were simple, but clean. Our problem was upon our arrival. The problems started when we first came to hotel - we had told them we would be there at about 10 am after getting through customs, etc and getting a ride from the airport. This was our first stop on our trip as well, so we were very jetlagged and tired. When she answered the door, it was as if we were putting her out, she did not seem happy to see us and told us our room was not ready (even though my email confirmation said it would be upon us coming at 10am). She said it woudl be ready in an hour and we were fine with that and did a quick tour at the Anne Frank House. We came back and took a nap. When we left that nite, i just happened to notice that the room said it was 100 Euro a nite, instead of the 80 we were promised in the email i had. I brought this up to the lady and she said 'oh you are in teh wrong room, we will have to switch you tomorrow'. i asked her why we could not switch thena nd she said our room was taken. i said well i am not goign to pay full price and she said yes you are b/c you just told me....it was still the same day and i did not think this was fair. Then we made the mistake of asking her where the 'bull dog' is. we were told it was a good place to go eat and instead it is actually a 'coffee shop'. we did not know this and she started to yell at me saying there is no smokin in the hotel and that is a place to get Marijuana. i assured her that we were not there to do drugs and just were told it was a place to eat and if she had a better palce in mind. she just said 'just go in that direction and you find something'. not very friendly or the kind of advice we were expecting. the next morning we came down for breakfast but were told our other room was not ready, so we needed to take a nap and told her we were goign to do this and her maid siad to just let her know when we were ready to change rooms later and would do this. we took a nap until 2 or so and went down and she said we could no longer exchanage rooms. i asked why and she started to yell at me again saying that her maid was gone and could not switch us. i said we can move our own luggage, etc, and she said that she was not going to do it and started to falsely accuse us of things we were doing in Amsterdam that she did not approve of and that we were goign to give her a heart attack with all our arguing with her. I simply did not say anythign to her!!! i told her it was not our fault for being put in the wrong room after her tantrum, and were not goign to pay full price and we agreed to pay in the middle. we were never offered anything extra at teh breakfast buffet, and when i went down the next morning without my boyfriend, she asked where he was and i said he has jet lag and she said 'yeah, amongst other things'. I was offended that again she was making assumptions and she just slammed my silverware and plates down in front of me and i asked for coffee andshe never brought it, but instead told us to pay her. She was a very rude hostess, not welcoming, and we also had to ask her five times to get us a cab for the airport. We felt like we were staying at our grandmother's house.
