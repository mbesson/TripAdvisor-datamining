I was recently at this location on business and initially was placed in a room near the elevator despite a prior request for one farther away. I was a little unhappy to find nothing was available however the front desk clerk did some searching and was able to find something for me during the time I went to my car to grab my bags. I sincerely appreciated his efforts. Overall the hotel appears to be newer with modern decor and furniture and an air conditioning system that works very well. The room was very clean and the mattress firm. The water coming out of the shower seemed rather weak but nothing that I could not deal with. I took advantage of the gym and found the machines functioning well and consisting of two treadmills, a stair climber, a bike and a pulley machine. I also used the mini office and found the equipment working properly. Breakfast does need some work. The food was heavily salted and my despite two requests, the waiter continued to forget to bring coffee and then forgot cream. i finally ended up getting up and getting the items myself. I am sure this is something that can be corrected. In general I would recommend this location and plan on staying here in the future.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Bend, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cGreat Staff, Great Stay\u201d", "Author": "Family-o-Six", "ReviewID": "UR125826933", "Content": "I was only at this hotel for a one night business stay.

Staff are very nice there. Be prepared there is no free breakfast, restaurant in the hotel has good food but pricey. Have a fully equipped small gym, a pool, and rooms are very spacious. If you have a suite that has a whirlpool be prepared they are not well cleaned, I filled up the tub and when I turned the jets on a whole bunch of black stuff came out, so my advice is don't bother spending the extra money on the suite with the whirlpool yuck! but all i all a very great place to stay.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again\u201d", "Author": "mollymop12", "ReviewID": "UR124914974", "Content": "Rooms were great, hotel staff was fantastic.

It was very clean and the rooms were quite. We stayed in a king whirlpool suite. It was a large room. almost too large for the amount of furniture it had. My fiance enjoyed the tub the morning after the game. She said the jets were nice but the tub was too short. Made for someone 5'0\" or smaller. One important thing to note is the bed. The bed was a comfort control bed, meaning you can adjust the firmness of softness on each side by adjusting a dial. When we first laid down the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable. We adjust our respective dials to soft and the bed remained hard. After about an hour the bed started to get softer. The bed must have continued to soften as the night went on because when we woke up it was perfect. We both had a great night sleep. My advice would be to adjust the bed to your liking as soon as you get in the room, so your not uncomfortable when you first go to bed. Breakfast was included with our room. The kitchen was \"indisposed\" (as the waitress told us) so the only thing available was the buffet. (odd that the kitchen was indisposed for menu items but it was ok for cooking buffet items) It was as good as a buffet could get. The service was good and the dinning area was clean. The hotel does have a bar area that I overheard someone saying was open until 4AM. I would guess that was because there was a group of people from the game having drinks and as long as there is business they will stay open. Overall a excellent hotel at this class level. I travel for work and have stayed at many hotels that are supposed to be at this level and this was one of the nicest.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Bloomfield, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "ComebackShane", "ReviewID": "UR120676119", "Content": "This is a very nice and clean hotel.

I liked the well-organized hutch containing the coffee brewer. micro and fridge. The king-sized bed, albeit a set-your-own-firmness mattress came with a multitude of smaller, square-shaped pillows, each one less comfortable than the last one. I refer to them as \"cement sacks.\" Neither of us got a good night's sleep account of the pillows. The next morning a bunch of us ate breakfast together in their grill. There was a choice of the buffet or order from the menu. I checked out the buffet and saw several items were out or low and I advised the cook staff who's body language told me my advice was not appreciated. They did replenish those items quickly to their credit. The food was just OK, not bad but nothing special. I enjoy biscuits and gravy when traveling and was slightly disappointed in the gravy that was pretty bland tasting. Our waitress to her credit was very obliging and informative.
