I was his guest. They were aware of that. First they gave us a room that was not cleaned.Wastebasket had a condom wrapper, bathroom trash was full with a used condom sitting on top of the trash. They gave us another room. My boyfriend left said he might be back later after his welding class. I left for a little while, figured I go buy a few things I needed at the grocery store. When I came back I opened the door, immediately I knew someone had been in my room because it smelled like marijuana. Afraid and extremely upset I left. I called from a different location and told the Days Inn what had happened. I asked them to check their cameras to see who was in my room. I told them I didn't even want to return but that I would contact them later to find out what happened. Later I decided to go to the front desk personally.I mentioned I was the one who called earlier and that the room was in my boyfriends name. The night clerk checked the computer and told me the room is under a different name. I couldn't believe it. This place apparently checked in another person and gave them a key as well even though it was the room my boyfriend and I were already occupying. They wouldn't even give me another room. The night clerk said if I wanted I could pay for another room but he couldn't give me a refund and that I had to wait until the morning when management was in to try to have this problem solved because they had no record of my boyfriend ever checking in.Not to mention they didn't give my boyfriend a receipt when he checked in. The next day my boyfriend went there personally, told them what happened and at that time also requested a receipt, which they did give him. Managements response to their screw up was your girlfriend wasn't even the registered guest on file and our company policy doesn't allow us to issue a refund. They didn't even give us a nights stay free of charge which would have been the very least they could have done. We were cheated of a nights stay and our money. This place prefers drug users as guests is my assumption. I will be reporting them to the Better Business Bureu. I hope this helps anyone questioning whether they should stay there.

I don't work for this motel or receive any commission for giving them good reviews but I really don't understand why all of the bad reviews of this place. As motels go I think it is really good and I am quite picky. The motel was quite busy this time. The parking lot was full as was the motel but it was not noisy at night. We didn't bother to reserve this time because we were on a driving holiday and weren't sure exactly when we'd get to SD. We basically rolled in after dark and got the last room available, ground floor right in front of the pool. Our coffee pot was broken and the fridge didn't work when we arrived. I went to the evening desk clerk and told him. He gave me a new coffee pot right then and there and someone came and fixed the fridge promptly the next morning. The microwave worked fine... we warmed up our continental breakfast from the lobby in it. The orange juice and apple juice are a nice additional thing that this place give with their 'lobby' breakfast. Many places just have pan dulce or bagel and coffee. The room was clean again, linens in good condition and clean and the room had no bugs. I've stayed in four different king size bed rooms here now and they have all been the same, spacious with a love seat and coffee table at the entrance, bed beyond and a large closet. The motel for sure isn't downtown but if you have a vehicle old town, Coronado (my favorite beach) and other SD attractions are all within easy driving range. It is also convenient for entering or arriving from Mexico whether through one of the southern California border crossings or if using I-8 to or from Arizona.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guanajuato, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cThis was the third visit to this Days Inn, I'll stay there again...\u201d", "Author": "Nan N", "ReviewID": "UR116233917", "Content": "We've stayed here three times now, November 2010, April 2011 and June 2011.

I have actually joined trip advisor to write this review. If i could give quality of sleep, and location negative ratings, i would. seriously, and i am a very reasonable person. I am travelling with my long term girlfriend, and we have been getting around california via public transport, as we cannot rent a car. This place is just over THIRTEEN miles out of downtown san diego. It is in one of the roughest areas; is 100yards from the freeway, and WORST OF ALL, the fire station is next door. That means every time a fire engine is deployed you get to hear it, which has been around 5 times a day since we came yesterday. It takes an hour to get in via a walk, then blue line MTS (san diego trolley train), and it is cheap to get in, but trains are horribly crowded. Nearby, well, nothing. There are lots of petrol stations, and a dennys, a taco bell, and a pizza place accross the road, which is great, i might add. Portions are huge, and the salad we got was huge and very fresh. The area is what you would be describing as the ghetto of san diego. The hotel has barbed wire around the back, and security cameras at the front, so that maybe hints at how it feels for security. In its favour, rooms are on the larger side, the beds are huge, although ours had an obvious orange stain on the sheets, like crisps had been smothered in, which we weren't best pleased with. The aircon is quiet, and cool, there is a fridge, microwave, tv with good channels, clock with alarm, and a decent shower. High speed wifi is also free. Reception is manned 24hours. We hung out at the pool today for 3 hours and neither went in after seeing the water, it looks nice from a distance, but i'm guessing it hadn't been cleaned in a long while. This probably won't affect you if you stay here, as i'm sure they're cleaned periodically. It is also very off putting that to stay in the sunshine when at the poolside, you are partially exposed to the traffic (people can see you), and it is noisy (the traffic i mean), which is not nice at all. The beach is over three miles down the street we are 1 away from, the concierge told us, and he said it is not a nice beach, but there is a harbour with boats and a couple of restaurants, so don't go there for relaxation/surfing/bike hire. We have yet to check it out. TO SUMMARISE: if you are here to see san diego, not mexico, do NOT stay here. You will struggle to sleep and take an hour each way to get in to san diego. You also have a busy freeway to contend with right on your doorstep, on top of the fact that you are staying in a rough part of town. The hotel staff are friendly enough and the room is adequate in size/features, but you will not enjoy your stay. If you are using it for mexico hopping its ideal. Less than 5 miles from the border from where we are. I hope this can help some of you fellow travellers. We wish we had extended our stay at huntington beach (\"surf city\" - amazing place never previously visited) instead of coming here to stay here.

The area is in South Chula Vista, but very convenient and you can get right on the freeway. I got a good price, and would not hesitate to come back here. Possibly the tarps on the floor in the last review were because they were renovating the place. The room was better than average, and it certainly did not have any kind of odors.
