Located very close to SOL metro station, where all the shops, and restautrants are. Plenty of activities. All the bus and Metro transit runs by this area. the rooms are clean with Hard wood floors throughout, clean bathrooms ( european bathrooms are always small for American standards). every room has a window, ours was on the back of the hotel, so it was good not to have any noise coming in from the streets below, as people stay up till 2AM in the busy streets. the breakfast is good. And they apparently have internet in the rooms, I could never get mine to work. Also our room had a seperate hot and cold water faucet ( weird), should be replaced with a new single faucet. Room had Cold AC, clean towels, very secure. Really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic little place\u201d", "Author": "s0neill", "ReviewID": "UR137152791", "Content": "This hotel was perfect for our needs. I was a bit worried with it being called a hostal, however I soon discovered it just means small hotel!! Our room was at the back of the hotel and therefore there was no view! However it meant it was quieter at night. It was very clean. We were given clean towels everyday. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. The breakfast was OK, more suited to european people who eat lots of fruit!!! The toast with various toppings were lovely. The breakfast place is just around the corner of the hotel. Overall, we enjoyed our visit and would recommend this hotel for people looking for somewhere cheap and friendly to stay.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, clean, friendly, great breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "panicbuttonnyc", "ReviewID": "UR137061636", "Content": "Our family stayed here for two nights in July 2012. We followed other travelers' advice and requested an inside room not facing the busy street which is lined with restaurants and people party late into the night - so we had quiet when we wanted to go to sleep. The hotel's location is great, just a block from the Puerta Sol train station and a short walk to the Plaza Mayor. Tons of great small restaurants within a stone's throw. This was our first time to Madrid and we didn't know what to expect. It was a fun cross between NYC and Key West. Lots of activity and restaurants open late and it feels very safe. The hotel is upstairs two tall flights but there is a small elevator. The complimentary breakfast is at the owners' restaurant a block and a half away and it's yummy - choices of a small loaf of toasted bread (pan rustic) with various toppings plus a small buffet with some meats, cheeses, and fruit. We were very pleased. Would have liked to have more time to have eaten there for dinner. Room was extremely clean with a very modern shower (great water pressure and a rainfall shower head) although no auditory privacy on the toilet. There was plenty of air conditioning and individual room control. The rooms are like small dorm rooms - very efficient with unbelievably hard mattresses even for Europe. That was the only downside. I could have used a mattress topper and more than one pillow. But it was a good value and the location, cleanliness, great wifi connection (we were traveling with a teenager), safe facility, and yummy breakfast would bring me back here next time I'm in Madrid.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maidstone, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Quincalot", "ReviewID": "UR124766695", "Content": "Great location.

A great hotel if you're planning a citytrip. The rooms are big, clean and comfortable. Even though the hotel is located in the middle of the center, we didn't heard any noises. It was very quiet and perfect for sleeping. The only disadvantages we can think of is that the hotel is a bit hard to find. You have to pay attention otherwise you just pass the hotel because the sign is very small. When you enter the hotel you have to go through a shared apartment building which is a bit strange the first time. Also the breakfast was limited. But generally a great hotel. So we gave it a 8/10.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Petherton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cwell appointed and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "steve1208080", "ReviewID": "UR111059514", "Content": "Our 'suite' at the front was large and comfortable though the living area was continuous with the sleeping area, however the street noise was considerable and went on until very late so we asked to be moved to a room at the back; this was smaller but still comfortable and much quieter.

Staff were friendly and helpful and spoke good English. Breakfast was served around the corner in a restaurant but was nice and set me up for a busy day of seeing the sights.
