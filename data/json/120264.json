I will be spending my 2nd week at Sierra Suites in August. I go there twice a year for a relaxing and fun filled vacation. You couldn't ask for better hosts than Rick and Ada. Yes, the oceanside parking lot is very small and can only hold a handful of vehicles. This is why the one car per unit requirement is there. However, if you have someone joining you that has a vehicle, all you have to do is let Rick or Ada know and they will gladly allow you to park that vehicle across the street. It's not fair to the other guests for people to try and cram as many folks into one unit, after the fact, in order to get a smaller unit at a more reasonable price. If there were to be extra's that will be joining someone, they should look into renting the 3 bedroom 2.5 bath. My sister and niece may be coming up from Fort Myers while I'm staying at Sierra Suites next month. I have already notified Rick and Ada of this and that they will be needing to park their Chevy Avalance across the street. Rick has no problem with this and thanked me for notifying me in advance. If you want a big place with a big parking lot, there are many hotels on Daytona and the surrounding beaches where you can share the pool with 100s of people, listen to loud music, wait for elevators and be around alot of drinking. Rick and Ada run a quiet and relaxing resort. Somewhere where you can forget about your problems and just kick back, have fun and relax. Rick and Ada give you their cell phone number and its posted on the premises. They also live on the premises. Having stayed at the Sierra Suites for a few years now, I know that Rick would have done whatever he could have to help this family out . . . . especially if there was an illness.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middleburg, Florida", "Title": "\u201c7 year old's vacation ruined\u201d", "Author": "Stephanie A", "ReviewID": "UR135545305", "Content": "First of all, I do not know where the \"wonderful\" owners were at! I guess they took the week off because I have never been so humilitated by him in my entire life. My 7 year old daughter and I had been looking forward to spending a week with family, but instead turned out to be a nightmare. My husband came to visit us the 3rd day we were there to celebrate his birthday with us. He parked his vehicle across the street (they have NO parking). We went to dinner and around midnight, the owner was calling my Aunt stating that the guy in the truck needs to leave now. My husband did not plan on spending the night but he had gotten sick after dinner(we had 11 people, 6 adults and 5 children in a 2 bedroom with 4 queen size beds and a sofa sleeper, we had plenty of room for him to stay one night). We tried to explain this to Mr. Wonderful but he all he kept telling my family was that we need to pack up now and leave. I did pack up my child, while in her pajamas, and we left. My child cried the entire 2 hour drive back home. Now on Sunday, I told the owner that I was going to park my car at the garage so he would not complain about the cars taking up his small parking lot. He told me that I did not need to do that, just park across the street. One minute he tells you can do something and when you do it, he is calling you asking you why you did that. He is very contradicting. Now I will tell you that this place is by far the best spot on the beach. Great rooms, great pool, great access to the beach, but all that is useless when you have to beware of a contradicting OWNER. Thanks for your \"hospitality\"! My family may come back to stay, but I will not. Thank you for making a memory that will last a lifetime for my 7 year old and me having to explain to her why we had to leave.

It's right on the beach, and I left my personal items at the pool & went to the beach at will & never worried about them going missing. Only guests are allowed at the pool area & to access the beach from Sierra Suites. The gate is locked & only its patrons have access keys.

A few years later Ric and Ada bought this motel and the changes for the better really started. They redid the landscaping, bought new patio furniture, redid the guest units, remodeled the rooms, added new furniture, tvs, bedding ect. overall made it a very welcoming place to spend ones vacation. Ric and Ada are a husband and wife team who do their bookings, cleaning and fixing when it has to be done, they do it all. They are the most congenial people you will ever meet. They will bend over backwards to make your vacation as pleasant as possible. This is a small motel, 9 units consisting of 1, 2 & 3 bedroom units and a one kitchenette unit.

I have never met such gracious hosts as Rick and Ada Harman. You will never find more personal service anywhere.We were treated as guests not just another number. We have stayed at highrise condos before but never again. Where else would you find the owner helping out when the keys were locked in the car? Where else would you be treated to Krispie Creme doughnuts fresh and warm? Where else would you have the owners light the chimnea and sit and chat with you? No where that I know of. The room was comfortable,clean and such cozy beds. I love Sierra Suites and will be back next year!!! Thank you Rick and Ada.

After searching forever for an available and affordable hotel we stumbled upon the Sierra Suites. This is a very unique property - with only a few rooms (seven, I think). They are more like condos than rooms as they have a full kitchen and washer/dryer. We originally booked a one-bedroom, but the owner showed us a three-bedroom unit on the second floor that overlooked the pool and beach. We decided to splurge on it. The kitchen was excellent--new appliances and such. The living room/dining area was very comfortable. They had a large TV but didn't find many station available (who cares, you are on the beach). The beds were comfortable, and the bathrooms - while dated - were fully functional. This place reminded me more of staying with friends or family than a 'luxury' vacation like the Ritz or high end chain hotel. There were only a few rooms occupied when we were there, so generally had the place to ourselves. If you consider keep in mind this is an older property, but one with lots of charter and friendly owners who live just across the street. There is limited parking, so that might be an issue with a large group. This is probably the best place to stay in Daytona--for anyone over 25, anyway. Would definitely return.
