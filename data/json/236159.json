Further on you have a choice of different kind of jam, chocolate, cookies, cornflakes, ...... they serve tea or coffee at your table. If you want cold milk or orange juice, they have that too ! The only minus is the 4 floors with no elevator. Luckily enough i could stay on the 1st floor, because i emailed them first :) I surely would recommend this hotel also because it is situated near the center. Only a 10-15 minute walk to the pantheon and trevi. A 15 min. walk to collos. and so on .. we never had to use public transport to get around !. When you leave the hotel, go to the left in the Via Arenula, cross the bridge and pick a good restaruant in Trastevere. They have a big selection of good, cosy and not too expensive family run restaurants. Me want pizza now !!!!! :)))) later all !", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kortrijk", "Title": "\u201chighly recommended hotel for a city trip\u201d", "Author": "Jeroen_D", "ReviewID": "UR5528253", "Content": "We went to Rome from 17th till 21st July 2006. We were looking for a hotel which had to be centrally located and we only needed breakfast. Visiting Rome means walking a lot so we expected to be tired in the evening thus requiring a good bed. Well, we loved Arenula. It's close to the vivid Piazza di Navona and Campo dei Fiori. The bed was firm and very comfortable. The breakfast was more than satisfactory. The hotel personnel was very friendly, helpful at the desk and maintenance switched sheets and towels practically every day. Also worth mentioning is the fact that we weren't disturbed by any noise at night. The only minus we can think of are the stairs. We were on the top floor (4th) and there is no elevator. Luckily the stairs are big and we only used them in the morning and the evening. A perfect hotel for a city trip!

It's also close to Trastevere train station, which is handy if you're coming from fuimuciano airport as you can take the train to Trastevere station then a cab or tram to the hotel. There are good eating places nearby. I liked the area as it's not as flooded with tourists as up round Spanish Steps and Trevi fountain area. The hotel has a lovely spiral staircase up to the rooms and rooms are tidy and clean. Our room had a balcony but it simply looked out on other buildings, had no seating, was dirty and very unappealing. We were only there for 2 nights so didn't really need any outdoor area. If we'd been staying longer, I would have preferred a hotel with a rooftop garden area, as it gives you somewhere to chill out and get away from the busy-ness of Rome. I booked this hotel via their website and requested a 2+1 room. However, we were only booked in for a double room. I should have checked the hotel's confirmation email more carefully. Upon arrival, we had to live with the double room for the first night and they were happy to move us to a more appropriate room for the following night.

The main tourist bus (64 and/or 40) is only a few blocks away. As for the breakfast - it is a typical European (continental) breakfast. Every morning there were fresh rolls, sweet rolls, yogurt, fruit, juice, coffee/tea, cereal, bread, crackers. Yes, there were times when you had to wait for a table, but that was usually after 9:00 and we only waited a few minutes - it really wasn't that big a deal. The reception desk has bus tickets available, and were great with directions and advising which bus to take. The room was a regular size for Rome, and it was exceptionally clean!

The breakfasts were very filling (croissants, rolls, fresh fruit, yogurts, cereals, biscuits) and the restaurant staff very friendly.

Morning breakfasts are really excellent with fresh fruit, bottomless great coffee, fresh tasty croisants, cheeses, cereals, etc. In all honestly I can advise anyone going to Rome to stay in the Hotel whether you are a couple travelling on a romantic trip or a group wanting excellent value being close to all the beautiful sites that the city has to offer. The rooms are spotlessly clean, the water pressure in the showers is strong (unlike the Hilton) and the maids are so friendly you may want to return home with one in your suitcase!
