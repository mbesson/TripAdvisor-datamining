I booked La Belle Juliette as a surprise for my wife's 40th birthday. Even before we arrived we had an inkling of how good they would be when I contacted the hotel to ask if they could book some restaurant's for us in advance. They complied without hesitation. When we arrived we found that the front of house staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble, from advising us where to have a quick bite to eat, which was the best way to walk to a certain location, or just wishing my wife a happy birthday. They took an interest in us and our stay and that, for us, is what makes a hotel enjoyable. The other part, naturally, is the room. I had booked the Junior Suite ( Well it was her 40th) and this was a beautiful room, with a fantastically huge bed, huge bath, 2 Mac pc's and a Nespresso machine which i found a daily use for. Overall the room was tip top. We stayed for 3 nights and each one of them was a blast and it started and ended with the hotel and its staff. A better, more wonderful hotel staff we have not found anywhere. I cannot rate this hotel highly enough, It's a small treasure with only the 30 odd rooms but for that you are made to feel like you are the only people staying there and you cannot put a price on that.

This sentiment is no doubt helped by the fact that the very friendly front-desk staff gave us an upgrade upon learning that this was our honeymoon. We were overjoyed as you can imagine! While I'm on the positives - the hotel, it's well sized public lounge areas and our junior suite are all beautifully decorated in a tasteful mix of modern & period pieces of furniture. Each floor is dedicated to one of the places 'Juliette' enjoyed traveling to with ours done in an Italian theme. The front desk informed us the hotel was only a year old and you can tell - everything is clean and unworn. Our room was small by standard suite standards but largish by Parisian ones with a small sitting room, a bedroom and a bathroom with a very nice bath and shower head (unusual for Europe) and separate toilet. We had not one but two iMacs which act as both a computer and TV - we didn't use either as we had all of Paris to explore but made liberal use of the free wifi. The room had no mini bar but the complimentary bottle of still and sparkling each day was welcome and I spotted a coffee machine with capsules that remained untouched but a nice idea.\u00a0 I've referred several time to the front desk staff - these guys were good!! Very helpful, warm and friendly at all times and if they were all we were rating the hotel on I would be giving it ten out of five. No task was too daunting and a highlight was when they discovered a restaurant we had wanted to visit was shut down. They tirelessly tracked the chef to a new venue - investigated and discovered the food was of the same style as the old one and took the liberty of booking us a table. I love that kind of proactivity!\u00a0 The location of the hotel was a major positive for me but I realize not all people may not be my way inclined. It is on an adorable Parisian street with many little shops, bistros, etc but feels more local than touristy. It is a short walk from any of the main sights but I feel St Germain-de-pres is a sight in itself to be honest. My best discovery was Le Bon Marche just around the corner - we made liberal use of both the gourmet supermarket (mmmm cheese, ham and crusty bread galore!) and the oh so Parisienne department store. Now onto the negatives. The breakfast which is not included leaves a lot to be desired. I could get past the lack of buffet and rather limited menu if there weren't so many mistakes but we gave up after three tries and purchased our own breakfast at the local boulangerie to eat in our room on the fourth day. The service was strikingly unfriendly when contrasted with that of the front desk. On the first morning the coffee was ice cold, the bread basket that was ordered never arrived, and more concerning was the number of other guests we heard complaining loudly about their experience. The second morning I ordered the plate of Italian meats and cheeses which arrived sans cheese. When I pointed it out one waiter informed me it didn't come with cheese while the other said it did and proceeded to inform me the chef was asleep so they couldn't confirm what went on the dish. Other experiences included orange juice running out (there was a supermarket and fruit shop virtually next door!), a dish arriving with two kinds of cheese one day and only one the next, coffee without milk when milk wad requested and so on.\u00a0 Inside the hotel bedroom I'm sorry to say the mattresses were much too soft - if you have a bad back I would recommend you avoid. The bedcovers were sheets with wool blankets (unfortunately wool makes me itch) and the wardrobe posed a problem with the doors not having enough room to open due to a lack of space. Lighting which I see is attempting to be atmospheric is a problem - specifically the lack thereof. And I know it's the thought that counts but when we arrived in our suite, overjoyed at our recent upgrade we were made even happier by the rose petals scattered on our beds only to be somewhat disappointed by a note offering us 'this' bottle of champagne with their compliments but no actual champagne to be found!\u00a0 In hindsight I think that with this hotel ranked 6 out of 1500+ on Trip Advisor our expectations were high and were probably judging more harshly than we might have done but when balancing the room cost with the TA rating and our other Paris and Western Europe hotel experiences I think this is still a fair review.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery memorable!\u201d", "Author": "dancing_luv", "ReviewID": "UR123580183", "Content": "We stayed at La Belle Juliette for 8 nights recently.

We felt safe (comparing to Hotel Lebron, but that's another story)! Here are 2 pleasant and memorable things about the hotel: 1. When we moved in, Carlos (front desk guy) suggested that we let them keep our suitcases till departure. That was the first case in my traveller practice! I was sooo grateful, for we had three suitcases. 2. Oh, that was one of the greatest surprises in my life! My boyfriend adores Nutella, and I always bring him one or two from every trip. This time I wanted to find a place to buy the BIG FAT 5kg jar, one they have in creperie kiosks (it's Christmas time, isn't it?). So, I asked the concierge, but was told to look for a big supermarkets. Then, my friend encouraged me to ask a woman from the Christmas bazaar down the Tour Eiffel, and she sold us one! With a little help from my friends :) Then, when I was back in my room, with 5kg bag in my hand, I was simply shocked - I saw the same BIG FAT 5kg Nutella jar near to iMac!!!

The staff were warm and professional. They were polite, well presented, spoke good english and had our room ready. The hotel is beautifully interiorally designed. The clours are magnificant but its not overly modern to make you feel ill at ease. The room was smallish though reasonably sized compared to other Paris hotels weve stayed at. The room decor was immaculate as was the bathroom and separate toilet. There was no coffee maker though I think you do get this in a suite. Ours was a superior room with bath. Only critism was the shower curtain on the bath was a bit cheap looking. However the bathroom was again beautifully designed and had the best shower my wife had ever come across. We had a cocktail in the liovely lounge before going out. The interior design in the public areas is out of this world. My cocktail was good aswell served with some tiny tasty tomato bread snacks. The music was very relaxing. The concierge seemed professional with respect to booking tables and restaurants, taxis etc. Their recommendation of a new restaurant on the same street Lachetta wasn't great though nice atmostphere and ambience. We ate another night at a restaurant from Time out LA CERISAIE - 70, boulevard Edgar Quinet 75014 PARIS which was superb!! The spa is small but again amazingly designed and very relaxing. Can't fault the place. Overall this hotel was one of the best I have stayed in. I would recommend it strongly.

The tv and in-room computer are beautifully engineered and technologically integrated nicely. The young staff is good, and the hotel is generally managed very well. The location is very good, close to Bon Marche and Luxembourg Gardens, though it is fairly far from the Seine, and a bit of a walk to the more lively areas (like Rue de Buci) of St. Germain.

I would give it 5 stars except for two issues we had with the front desk. One was a wake up call we requested that never came. From a 4 star hotel, a basic request like this should be honored. Secondly, one of the concierges at the front desk went online to help up buy Eiffel Tower tickets and charged 4 to our credit card instead of 2 as we had asked. Instead of the hotel offering to pay for the extra two or a glass of wine in their cafe, he told us to try to hawk them at the Eiffel Tower. I realize it was an accident, but that is not the best customer service. Overall, I enjoyed this hotel and its cozy neighborhood.

The hotel has used all available space very well, we even had a separate bathroom (which was so much bigger than expected) from the toilet. Yes there is no escaping the fact that compared to other cities the rooms are small be what they my lack in space they make up for in beautiful decor and style. It felt like the new French and not the tired out dated rooms most French hotels are decorated in. The IMac computer in each room that is fully integrated in to the TV just sets this hotel apart, was perfect for us to stay in touch or do some research on. Very smart idea guys.

We had stayed at another hotel in their group, the Hotel des Grands Hommes, on our last trip and were extremely happy with them. We wanted to stay in Saint-Germain-des-Pres this time, so we decided to go with this new property, a four-star-rated hotel. Overall, we were once again very pleased with the quality of the room. Waiting for us when we arrived was a very nice bottle of champagne, with rose petals leading to the bed (very romantic!) and a note congratulating us on our anniversary. We stayed in a Deluxe room, the nicest of the non-suites. The size of the room was right in line with other hotels in Paris, particular in this neighborhood (read: on the smaller side, but big enough to be comfortable). The bed was the equivalent of an American 'king size' and was very comfortable. Highlights: 1) The shower was AMAZING! It is one of those 'rain' showers with the giant disc over your head, but it also had three powerful jets on the back wall to complete immerse you in powerful water flow! If you don't want to get your hair wet, you can use the jet in the front rather than the overhead rain shower head. Best shower I've ever experienced. 2) In-room iMAC, with free Wi-Fi access. This is immensely valuable for doing such things as looking up restaurants, making reservations, finding museum times, etc. the iMAC doubles as the TV and radio (for radio, I recommend the station FIP). 3) the in-room Nespresso coffee maker. If you've ever had Nespresso espresso, you'll know why I am so excited about this! 4) Free bottled water. This seems kind of innocuous when writing it out, but having that cold water in your room when you come back from walking around Paris all day was very, very nice. 5) Management. We had a couple of minor issues with some charges, but they were addressed quickly and fairly by the hotel management. 6) The staff made several good recommendations for restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel and even made a couple of reservations for us. A few minor issues: 1) There is no turn down service. My wife and I would come back after walking around all day and sometimes take a quick nap and a shower before going out in the evening. It would have been nice to come back to a freshly made bed and fresh towels. 2) The remote for the TV would sometimes be wonky and stop working altogether. We watched very little TV, though, so this was in no way a big deal. Other notes: 1) A survey was given for us to complete after our return, and a very quick reply was given by the deputy manager acknowledging our concerns, particularly about the turn down service. I feel confident that the hotel will have this service in the near future. 2) There is a very lovely looking pool and spa that my wife and I did not visit, but if you like a morning swim that's a nicety. 3) There is a very lovely little bar in the hotel as well; again, my wife and I did not visit so I cannot comment on the drinks or food, but it looks wonderful.

Having never travelled abroad, deciding where to stay was a decision I made with GREAT apprehension.

So, I really wanted to ensure I delivered a highly memorable and enjoyable experience. And, upon arrival, all my concerns were alleved. This hotel was utterly terrific! - Booked a junior suite, received an upgrade...without even realizing until after the fact. - Bottle of champagne provided upon arrival (we don't drink, but it was a very nice touch, as the champagne flutes were perfect for sipping the complimentary bubbly water - it was a rather hot day). - Box of sweets also provided. - Check-in and hotel tour was very nicely executed...all while bags were brought up to our room. - The staff (Emily is worthy of honorable mention) was VERY nice, very accomodating and very helpful (recommendations, additional assistance - Nespresso and Water provided continuously throughout our 9 night stay). - The room was immaculate...and remained so throughout the trip. Now as for the hotel... - In short, it was incredibaly charming, adequately sized, beautifully appointed, chic, romantic...I can go on and on and on.... - The dual MACs in the suite were very nice (for those travelling from the U.S. may I recommend Comedy Channel and other online channel offerings to make you feel more \"at-home\"?) - The glass-doored mini-fridge acted as our own private cheese cave/patisserie cabinet throughout our gourmand travels. - The bathroom has an incredible shower (rainfall/italian style version) and huge tub. - For a more substantial dip, try out the basement pool, which might be the coolest feature I've ever had access within a hotel. Also, the Hamaan will warm the bones, if you are travelling during colder days. - The common areas are small-ish, but beautiful. The courtyard was terrific and used daily for our morning coffee ritual. Value: - Lastly, comparatively speaking, without even taking into account the unexpected upgrade, this hotel was very attractively priced - check comparative offerings via Kayak, Orbitz, Expedia for proof.

We know the area and were at first delighted to find La Belle Juliette. However our delight ended quickly. The web site entices the traveler with its attention to detail. But the real experience left much to be desired. This is a boutique hotel that has a hard time delivering. I deliberately chose a junior suite knowing that left bank hotel rooms are notoriously small. However the design of the rooms made one feel very small instead. The queen bed left little room to access the wall long closet which while it had reasonable space could not be easily used. In fact one of the doors to the closet did not open even though it could have. Seems as if the designer did not want to ruin the aesthetic. The side tables next to the bed were about 8\" wide, large enough for nothing. The room(s) because in the suite there was a sitting room were equipped with large APPLE screens that could be used as TV, music, Movies (except there was no way to access any) and a computer. The rooms were wired for WIFI so at least we could use our Iphones in addition to the computer if we wished. The only problem was the drawers below the screen which contained the keyboard and mouse did not pull out far enough to access. Then there was the bathroom in the first room we had: It was a tub with a shower. However the tub free floated in its place and when one used the shower the water sprayed all over creating puddles on the floor. The hotel did move us to another junior suite where the tub was flush to the wall and thus didn't leak, however our new room was below a room with a free floating tub and the water from guest's use was soon seen oozing into our bathroom through the ceiling lights. The sink was free standing and there was no room to put any toiletries. The commode was in a completely different room right next to the door to the suite and about the size of utility closet. The hallways reminded me of a narrow train. We often found ourselves waiting quite awhile before anyone would answer the concierge phone. OK a boutique hotel..left bank Paris, I get it. I think next time I an going back to an older hotel with proven accommodations even if the rooms are small.

The room hadn't been cleaned and, just as we were settling down to watch a bit of TV and doze, we had a call asking if the maid could come and do the room.

I had sent several emails and never heard back. We were on a cruise and could not call so I had to have my cousin call for us to reconfirm. Added stress I did not need. Very tiny bars of soap that were not replaced everyday and housekeeping left two glasses of orange juice sitting for 3 days. A little strange. We would make a game out of it everyday to see if they would pick it up. Also, the refrigerator is not a true refrigerator, only cools beverages a little. I wish I had known this.

Our room 208, was neat, clean and comfortable - though a bit small for Superior. The hotel seems relatively new so towels, bedding and other things in the room are in good condition. The bathroom and bedroom, while compact, sufficed given how little time we spent in the room and the stylish design made up for a feeling of luxury. Access to iron and ironing board very useful - provided on request by staff. The bed was comfortable - much nicer than some of the European hard beds we have encountered. Room temperature seemed on the warm side - but the airconditioning worked well and continued to work when the key was removed and we were out maintaining the temperature we had set it on. A couple of drawbacks were: the lovely French windows were permanently closed and could not be opened for fresh air or view on the street. There was a distinct lack of soap - there was plenty of douche gel - butonly one small bar provided for basin and NOT shower. Soap was not replaced. We have a preference for soap bars - we have noticed that some hotels in Europe simply provide the shower gel. Other than these minor points - rooms were provided with bathrobes and slippers. Clever use of cupboards for storage with good number of hangers. A clean, comfortable hotel in Paris in a good area - if you are happy not to be in immediate proximity of the Champs d'Elysee. Good access to all key sites - though given the size of the city recommend the Red Tourist bus - hoping on and off for convenient travel around the city from this location. Metro -Vaneau located nearby - but the street signage did not correspond to the names we found on google making this a bit complex to find our way from the Metro for the first time. When in Paris definitely go to Terres de Truffes restaurant - if you like truffles this is the pace to go. We had a wonderful meal. Staff at the hotel organised taxi's for us and happily made the reservations. Paris - a great city, a good neat hotel choice, with a slightly modern twist, and a wonderful weekend. We did not have breakfast at the hotel - but chose to sit at a street side cafe - enjoying hot chocolats and croissants - ... and the place on the corner had fresh croissants and was as good as I recalled this breakfast experience from previous trip, some years ago. We sat people watching and enjoying breakfast at the pavement table - bon! so we can't comment on the meals here - surrounded by too many other options conveniently located to eat in.

We will absolutely stay here again when we return to Paris. We'd booked a superior room (or was it deluxe?). When we arrived, we were shown a junior suite as well, and we chose to upgrade to that (room 307). It has a small entry/sitting room in addition to the bedroom. We probably could have gotten by with the smaller room, but the extra space gave us some valuable breathing space. It also had a combination shower/tub, which had some appeal.

If you go across the street to \"Midi Vins\", they have a breakfast dish that will melt your heart. It has a base of chopped mushrooms, with a poached egg over it and a cream sauce with sea salt. It sounds somewhat basic, but really, delicious. There's also an intriguing children's shop called \"Serendipity\" nearby - worth a stop if you have little ones. I had read a few reviews of smaller hotels where people complained about street noise. There is some noise here in the early morning hours, and every room faces the street.

The concierge service at La Belle was the best I've experienced in Europe, by far. I have ONE minor comment, and that is with respect to the bathroom- our room had only curtains separating the bath area, so the entire room would become very humid when showering and the toilet was in a separate small \"closet-like\" room. This did not detract from our stay at all- we just opened the window when showering, but that may present an issue in the winter. I will definitely return (hopefully soon!).", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cthis hotel emphasizes the \"Paris-feel\"...\u201d", "Author": "FKR12345", "ReviewID": "UR102276824", "Content": "To me, Paris is about romance, elegance and decadence and La Belle Juliette embodies all of these. The interior is beautiful. The size is relatively small. A typical boutique hotel. Service is good. Staff takes the time to make sure you are properly attended to. Rooms are relatively small but charming. Beds are very good. The fact that opening a window at night is not really possible because of the noise is a minor setback but not unusual for Paris and has little to do with the hotel. The availability of multi-media in the rooms is a definite plus. Location in the 6th: main attractions not too far away whilst enjoying the tranquility of a neighbourhood. Boutique shops all around. To recap: I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to experience the \"Paris-feel\"...", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Komotini", "Title": "\u201cJust go and stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "Yk-Ifi", "ReviewID": "UR101001865", "Content": "Room : a bit small and low ceiling but one of the best and largest you can find in Paris, excellent colours, excellent bed, very good mini refrigerator (not for ice, but you can get free from the hotel bar), very nice bathroom with large bathtube (toilet separated at an isolated small room, i find that good for...odvious reasons... ). Cleanliness : excellent, every day. Stuff : excellent reception service, very friendly, ready to help you for everything. Location : quiet and safe street. Also very near at the hotel, 2-5minutes on foot, you will find many and nice caffes, bakeries, mini markets (Carrefour 3min), brasseries and generally many shops. Transportation : quiet hot spot, on foot , metro Vaneau 4min, metro SevresBabylon 8min, piazza taxi 6min. Internet : free, very quick and generally amazing! internet and TV are at a plasma Apple 26' screen. Hotel Bar : very cozy and excellent decorated with two fire-places, classic music, and trendy colours, but most nights empty of people. Restaurant : we where there 3-7 March, no restaurant, but they told us that the next day they would start it. Breakfast : DONT! no buffet, very-very poor and too expensive.", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "MurrayDublin", "ReviewID": "UR98384806", "Content": "Stayed for two nights. Hotel is still very quiet - it felt like we were the only people there most of the time (which we liked). The public areas are a little enthusiastically designed for my taste and it can all feel a bit try-hard but the rooms are large (for Paris), elegant and clean with black-out shutters, macs, free wi-fi, Nespresso machine and very comfortable beds. The staff are charming and very helpful - they might be a bit more rushed as the hotel gets busier. There are still a few teething problems to be ironed out - the Spa was closed when we were there and were were woken by the fire alarm on our first morning - but it's a pleasant place to stay and the area is great - a short stroll to Au Bon Marche and the shops of Rue Dragon, Rue de Bac etc. And it's on the same street as Mamie Gateaux, which is reason enough to stay there.
