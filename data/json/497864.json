The room itself was very clean, cleaned daily and as mentioned above in a very good location. There is a chinese restaurant near enough on site as well a couple other restaurants within close walking distance. There is also a small supermarket closeby. For muslim travellers there is a mosque close by (allegedly the largest in europe) that also houses a halal restaurant.

Arrived late at night so took a Taxi from the airport, about 20 EUR. Pleasant and helpful staff. Rooms are spacious but sparse. Hanging rail with wooden hangers but no wardrobe door or drawers. Small desk, TV with local channels. One chair. Spacious bathroom with full-sized bath, shower over, bidet etc. Plenty of water pressure and hot water. Rooms cleaned and new towels daily. I had a double bed, which was a bit hard, plain white sheets and cover. if you wanted to do some work there is no convenient light near the desk and only one socket (for the TV). Reception doubles as breakfast room, again sparse with basic tables and chairs. Breakfast consists of a choice of 3 cereals, coffee, tea, Orange, toast-it-yourself bread, nice to see brown as well as white. Selection of yoghurt, cold meats/cheese, average cold pastries. In a heated server were scrambled egg, hot-dog sausages and fatty bacon. There is also a 24/7 bar with a draft lager, bottles of Heineken and some spirits. More of a serving hatch than a bar, there is no bar atmosphere. 30 minutes of wi-fi per day, in reception, free on request. Wi-fi in the rooms seemed a bit pricey at 5EUR per hour. The nearest Metro is Barrio de la Concepceon 0.5 miles away but there are 2 changes required to get to Sol Square in the centre of Madrid. Bus 53 stops right outside the hotel and terminates at Sol so you don't need to know where to get off. Always a problem with buses I find. Fares are 1.5 Euro. I took the Metro back to the airport (2 changes required). There is a 3 EUR supplement for trips to/from the airport, payable at the ticket machine or at the airport end. Ticket machines operate in English. Enter ticket into the barrier, gates open, remember to collect your ticket before walking off, you need it to leave the system. Taxis also charge extra for airport trips, or any station. Official Taxis have a red stripe and shield on the door, they can be hailed in the street.

You need to ask for kettle to make tea in the morning but they don't provide english tea so bring your own PG tips or Tetley. We asked for milk every morning and happy enough to provide it. We didn't take the breakfast. There is a restaurant/supermarket chain called VIPS. English brakfast is for 5/6 euros with drink included. Lunch and dinner were also excellent and value is good too. There is also an Italian place called Mamma Mia and food was good and reasonable. We didn't manage to try the buffet chinese place called Chin Chin next to the hotel.

They are clearly visible in the Google Street level photo maps. VIPS - A restaurant that serves a tasty bit of everything including American fare. It has no special Spanish food or delacacies, but it had the great advantage of being OPEN at just about all hours. It is not fast food, but perhaps equivalent to Shoney's in the U.S. OpenCor - This is a small but rather well-stocked grocery store with gift items, magazines, toys, meat, deli, and actually a bigger quick mart.

From there it was a five minute walk to the hotel. The bus ride was a bargain at \u20ac1. On arriving at the hotel I was checked in pretty efficiently. I had booked a family room as I like the extra space and the bonus of the sofa however I was give a twin room instead. It was past 11pm and I couldn't be bother to complain about the mix up as the room was still very spacious. The room was exceptionally clean and all the fixtures and fittings were in exceleent coditition except for the walls. I don't know what it is about your typical Travelodge guest but whenever I stay in one the state of the room walls always bemuses me and Torrelaguna was no exception. The walls were dirty and had the paint scaped off them, this damage had obviously built up over a fairly long period of time so it was dissapointing that management had not seen fit to repaint. This is my only major complaint about the hotel. There were a couple of little niggles. The bed was a bit hard but it was a typical Spanish bed (thin mattress) and it didn't prevent me from getting a decent nights sleep. My booking confirmation said there was tea and coffee making facilities in the room, there was not so this was a bit dissapointing. The hotel is a bit out of the centre of the city but the bus stop that takes you directly to Sol is literally on the doorstep of the hotel. The number 53 takes about thirty minutes to get you in to the centre depending on traffic and a single ticket is only \u20ac1. The nearest metro station is Barrio de la Concepci\u00f3n on line 7. It's about a ten minute leisurely walk from the hotel. I got a three day tourist ticket for \u20ac13 this gives you unlimited travel on the metro, busses and local Renfe train services, you don't have to pay the 1\u20ac suppliment to to the Airport if you get the tourist ticket. It was a real bargain and came in a lovely pouch with a metro/street map included. Breakfast is available at the hotel for \u20ac7.50 but I can't comment on it as I declined to eat at the hotel, they also had a seemingly reasonable bar menu for meals and snacks.

(bus driver was very helpful in telling us what stop to get off). You can get the combo bus/metro pass at the airport. As far as getting downtown, the #53 bus will take you downtown from the hotel. (about 30-40 minutes). There is also a metro station (Barrio Le Concepcion) which is faster than the bus, but involves a longer walk (a bit over 1/2 mile), although there are several shops back to the hotel which we would stop to pick up some great ham, cheese, bread and wine and often make a dinner in our hotel rather than head back downtown in the evening. ROOM: Positives were good shower pressure, quiet, plenty of hot water, comfy bed with nice sheets, big towels, and extra pillows were gladly offered on request. The hotel and environs seemed quite safe. Negatives were it was a small room, basically clean, but showing a bit of wear. Plugs were hard to find for puter, cell phone, camera, etc. Ended up unplugging TV, etc, to have enough plugs for charging. FOOD The morning buffet (included in cost) was quite acceptable. Pretty American. Could get scrambled eggs, bacon, toast, peanut butter, yogurt, etc. In the evenings could get beer and some hard drinks. Restaurants in the immediate area are pretty scarce. Chin Chin (asian) next door was ok. There are also are some really good meat stores, markets, bakeries etc, as mentioned above between the metro stop and the hotel. Overall, its is not a bad place to stay and quite affordable. Although I think if I did Madrid again I would stay closer in.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201c30 Euro for three nights-- what a deal!\u201d", "Author": "annaleiseandsiobhan", "ReviewID": "UR67186924", "Content": "The Travelodge Torrelaguna is actually not too bad if you want a good place to stay in Madrid for a few days. It's a little far out but good once you finally find the hotel. It took us a very long time to find it but it's actually maybe a seven minute walk from the station. From the airport take the Metro Aeropuerto T1 T2 T3 at Line 8. Transfer at Colombia at Line 9 then onto Avenida de America at Line 7 to Barrio de la Concepcion station. The easiest way to get to the hotel once you leave Barrio de la Concepcion Metro station is to keep straight on Calle de Martinez Villergas for about 250. At the traffic lights you will see a Santander bank across the street; once you cross, walk up about 50m to your left where you will be at Calle Torrelaguna. Continue to walk for another 70m up the hill. The hotel is at a junction on the opposite side of the street. Hotel was very clean, rooms spacious and comfortable with nice easy to sleep in twin beds. Nice large bathroom with shower and bath. This is a no frills hotel so don't expect too much in extras. There are a few shops in the area-we passed several small mercados on the way from the train station. The area is quiet and safe. The only downside is that there are not many restaurants to choose from so you will have to venture out a bit if you want to eat during the hours when a lot of businesses are closed. It would be nice too if the hotel had at least one English speaking channel besides EuroSport. Even CNN or BBC News would suffice but no one wants to watch EuroSport the whole time they are in their room. Having said that it's not too bad so I think I would stay at this hotel again if the great price of 30 Euro for three nights were available again.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cThere Must be somewhere better\u201d", "Author": "Paddy54", "ReviewID": "UR64301013", "Content": "The Good: 3 restaurants with 100m.

We requested a kettle, cups, tea,coffee, from reception, and this was no trouble whatsoever. The kids slept in a sofa bed and this was a good size and comfortable. The room was serviced every day, and all of the staff very helpful and friendly. For us, the advantages of this hotel were that despite being only a No53 bus ride away to the centre of Madrid (10-15mins), the location was out of the biz, so perfect for families when you want some peace and quiet to get the kids off to sleep, and for us to relax. The bus stop was literally outside the hotel door! We never tried breakfast in the hotel, but this was available, as well as a good supermarket (Opencor) just across the road, and there were a few restaurants nearby. Madrid itself has something for everyone - shopping, culture, restaurants, bars and has a very safe atmosphere. The locals were friendly and helful. We regularl used the metro and this was very good. As a family, we particulary enjoyed the cable car ride over the city which takes you to a nice viewpoint and park, the theme park, the zoo with its great dolphins, the Retiro park, which was huge, and the Palace, which has free entrance on a wednesday to all EU citizens (remember to take your passport with you). The Real Madrid football stadium was worth a visit too. One of the 'eating out' highlights for us was our meal at the 'Botin' restaurant which boasts of being the oldest restaurant in the world (Guinness Book of Records). The suckling pig was delicious, and they were very happy to see the children there too! Great service.

Accommodation was booked by our host so we had no choice in the matter. Travelodges are generally fine if all you need is a clean bed for the night and a quick bite to eat in the morning. This Travelodge is no exception. Staff were helpful and generally quite friendly. As a hotel for Madrid sightseeing, I would not recommend this hotel. Although it is only a +/- 25 minute bus ride from the centre, you can find much cheaper, better and more characterful hostales (small hotels) right in the centre so why stay all the way out in Torrelaguna? Ate breakfast at the hotel on day 1 only. Selection was poor and quality likewise. Dreadful coffee. There's a cafe/bar across the street (beside the OpenCor mini-market) which is much better and cheaper too! As you might expect, facilities for business customers are next to non-existent. The bar (which seems to be always closed) is just an extension of the breakfast area and not conducive to chat and relaxation. Internet access is available but charged at a whopping \u20ac12/hour. Rooms are very clean but spartan. Bathrooms equally so. Shampoo, gel and soap are very, very low-end and are not replenished for the length of your stay - bring your own!! If your business takes you to this part of Madrid, I cannot recommend the Travelodge Torrelaguna for the reasons stated. If you are planning a leisure trip, stay in the centre and soak up the wonderful noche de Madrid!!!

It was the first time I had ever been to Madrid and we were a bit scared about the trip in a way. When we got to Madrid airport and asked taxi driver for the Travelodge Torrelaguna he seemed to get really mad ranting in Spanish because he didn't know where it was ( I don't think it's been there long but it's near the Novotel) however he managed to find it ok and it was only 15 minutes drive from the airport. When we walked in it was great, we have stayed at many Travelodges in England but none have been this luxurious! The front desk were very helpfull and our room was lovely and clean with air con. You could walk from the hotel to Madrid centre but it would take about 45 mins. There is really no need as the number 52 bus comes past the front of the hotel every few minutes. The bus services in Madrid are fantastic. Only 1 euro wherever you go and they are so realiable, buses are clean and air conditioned. Only problem is they are very popular and can get very full. This hotel is situated on the outskirts of Madrid but is near to many small restaurants dotted around so look out for them. We ate in the Italian across the rd a few times because it was lovely. There is also a supermarket just across the road which is really useful. Only problem I could come up with in the hotel is that the maids were very noisy in the morning. From 6:30am they were continuously banging doors.

We booked Travelodge Torrelaguna at Travelodge.com website. It was everything ok. We received an e-mail confirming our stay. We always make reservations using the hotels website and pay with credit card and we never have a problem. We arrived at Madri 1a.m., the night before the Gay Parade. We were exausted because we drove for 600 km from Lisbon (Portugal) to Madrid. The Travelodge looked ok and in a very good location. The bad news was that our reservation was canceled because they said we informed the wrong credit card number. We told that it was impossible. It was not the first time that we made a reservation using the Internet and we knew that we must use a valid credit card to garantee it. The front desk guy showed us the credit card number (was a stupid number like 4500000 something...), but we were sure that we didn`t inform that number. We told the guy that it was a stupid thing. We never inform a wrong number and we were sure to arrive that day. The hotel was full. We talked to the guy. While we were there, one guy that made the reservation by phone enter. And other two guys waited some minutes till the reception guy find their reservation. (Good luck, he found!). He tried to find other hotel after we asked. But my husband called another hotel and finally we had a place to stay the two nights. I want to say that if a client appears in the middle of the night with a reservation you just can`t say that he was wrong and \"the problem is yours\". It\u00b4s not a polite thing to say. I still don`t know what happened, but i`m sure that i put the correct number.

We got a great deal at 45 Euros a night. Finding the hotel was probably the most difficult part of our stay, fortunately my partner speaks spanish so he could ask the locals, but for non-spanish speakers I would highly recommend printing out a map of the area if you are trying to find your way from the train station. It is not that hard, it is just that the central Madrid maps don't cover this area in detail. The walk from the Torrelaguna station is 10-15 minutes (depending if you are dragging suitcases with you). Once you are settled at the hotel, the easiest way to get into central Madrid is on the bus that leaves from the front door of the hotel. It is very cheap (around 60 Euro cents), and you get to see a lot on the way. Ask the staff at reception for a map and information on the bus. We found the room to be a typical travelodge style, and very new. The room is basic, but very clean and comfortable. The hotel is located in a residential area, with a lot of high rise apartments surrounding it. There is a 7-11 style supermarket across the road, and 3 restaurants that provide reasonable family meals. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, but bought croissants from the small supermarket across the road. The staff on reception desk were very helpful. The only issue we had was that they called at 10am to ask if we wanted our room made up - when we had left the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.

They supplied excellent maps of Madrid and informed us of all the options for transport. There is a but stop directly in front of the hotel entrance, it takes about 20-30 minutes to get Puerta del Sol in the heart of Madrid, and the frequency of the service meant that we didn\u2019t have to wait more than a few minutes for a bus to appear. It only cost 1 euro per journey and it was a very pleasant way to get into the city centre. There are a few restaurants within close proximity of the hotel and although they may not be the kind of places that many tourists may look for, they were full of authentic Spanish families enjoying their night out. There\u2019s also a modern, well stocked, Carrefour, convenience store just over the road from the hotel. It was a very good place to stock up on supplies for a trip into the city but not at city centre prices. I stayed there for three nights and heard no noise from either other residents or the street. Getting to the airport was also very easy. It took about ten minutes in a taxi we caught at the rank adjacent to the hotel and cost around ten euros. There\u2019s also a bus stop for the airport situated about five or ten minutes walk away. For anyone on a budget or travelling with someone who doesn\u2019t want to stay in the madhouse that the city centre can be I would thoroughly recommend it. Their nightly rate is 35 euros per room, and at that price I doubt it will be beaten for value.

A stylish bar/cafe and seating area where breakfast and lunch is served. The Hotel staff are one of the best in customer service.
