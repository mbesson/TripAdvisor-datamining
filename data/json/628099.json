Words cannot describe this place, but I'll give it a try...Do you like giant cockroaches that are not afraid of humans? Well then this is the place for you. Never in my life have I seen such disgusting conditions. The bathrooms are full av cockroaches, stains, strange fluids and other filty things. The room makes you feel like you're in Guantanamo Bay...and if you're taller than 175 cm the beds will be way too small. Do NOT trust the pictures you've seen of this place, there is no similarity between them and the real thing!My room faced some kind of air vent, so falling asleep was literally impossible because of the noise, and strangely enough there was no air in this air vent so the room was extremely stuffy. And trust me: you do not want a stuffy room in Barcelona during the summer, unless you want to have the worst vacation in your life. As if falling asleep wasn't hard enough, every night a very annoying south american guy from the staff banged on everybodys door trying to make people go out and party with him....it felt like he only worked there because he was desperate for friends which was kind of creepy.Yes, this place is just as weird as it sounds, and even weirder....I'm actually shocked that it still exists...I was psychologically and physically broken down when I got home, first I showered for an hour and then I slept for 16 hours....what a horrible experience", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR320603004", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "stargazer999"}, {"Content": "Barcelona apartment, with maid service, wonderful! web site of apartments.---BOOKINGS c/ Aribau, 185 - 5\u6f5e 4\u964b - 08021 Barcelona Tel. ---Fax. --- email;---in the Gothic area!
