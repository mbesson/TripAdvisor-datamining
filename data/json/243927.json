Not so. As stated in other reports, the hotel employee was behind glass when we checked in after a late flight at 11:30 pm. I can't hold that against them, but there were problems with the room - specifically the door would not close without a lot of effort, resulting in a loud noise for my west coast daughter who was still sleeping when we woke up. Also, the outlets in the bathroom did not work at all, limiting use of hair dryers, and normal needs for charging cell phones, laptops, etc. But the worst was a local train that passed frequently during the night, using sustained loud (enough to wake us all) horn blast as it passed by the highway intersection. I would not recommend this hotel as there are other Phoenix low cost hotels that would likely be a better choice.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seongnam", "Title": "\u201cNot exactly a safe neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "thelonious22", "ReviewID": "UR122256522", "Content": "It was not a good sign when the cashier just stayed behind a thick glass and all transactions were done through the little slot underneath the thick glass...not the nicest looking neighborhood...the rooms are bit dirtier than the typical Motel 6...it is very close to the airport so if you have a super early flight the next morning, it's adequate for a night.,", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "LOS ANGELES", "Title": "\u201cSTAY AWAY!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "mauisonia", "ReviewID": "UR121098442", "Content": "My husband and I were passing by AZ and needed a cheap but clean/ quiet hotel to sleep as were were very tired. As soon as we saw this Motel 6 (chain I recall for being unexpensive, family oriented and clean back in the day) I said, let's try it! BAD IDEA! I guess the ADULT SEX shop across the street should've told us something! First, the room smelled muggy, just horrible! we had to keep the door open for 10 minutes, then as I wanted to get into bed and open it, I see something gross! Other peoples HAIRS on the pillowcases and sheets, one of them pubic..I immediatley asked the guy at reception to change rooms. He was actually very nice (name is Luis) and gave us another room, but the other one was just as bad. Not too many hairs but still found mascara marks on the sheets and stuff. We ended up wrapping the towels around the pillows and just using the sheet that looked the cleanest. In the middle of the night some fight broke out outside, needless to say I did not get a good night's sleep and was scared they were going to steal our rental car! We got up at 7am and left as soon as we could. Noisy as hell too!

I blundered into it by reserving on line WITHOUT READING THE REVIEWS... and trying to save a few bucks- bad mistake. The place is just north of the west end of the Sky Harbor Airport and about 100 feet from an Amtrak/ freight railroad crossing, in an industrial area. A \"one-on-one\" girlie place is across the street and there is an \"adult toy store\" nearby. Classy neighborhood. Strange locals milling about in the parking lot. The roar of the planes and the ringing of the railroad crossing penetrates the rooms like there are no walls and the trains themselves always blow their whistles- about a hundred times- as they approach the crossing - even in the middle of the night. The freight trains are about a hundred cars long. There are absolutely no amenities here, but the price is still pretty high- about fifty bucks- You can go to the La Quinta and live in absolute luxury for another twenty bucks- it WILL be worth it. The bedspreads are so garishly colored with the Motel 6 logo that the decor alone will keep you awake. Little tiny towels in a little tiny bathroom. No chairs to sit in to watch TV. The staff is nice, though and they have free (!) coffee in the office in the morning. And- they have an all-night security to guard to keep the derelicts from stealing the stuff out of your car.
