There were a number of restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance and the Sunday markets had lots of food stalls too which were very interesting. As for the hotel itself, it was adequate for the purpose we had picked it for, that is, a place to sleep after a long day of touring. The room seemed very dated and the pull out sofa bed was the worst example of its type I have ever encountered. The place was clean though and it had a kitchenette which was very handy for those travelling with children. The pool and spa area was quite nice and we used it a couple of times to wind down after a big day of touring. There was a coin operated guest laundry onsite too, again very handy when travelling with small children. The staff were always polite and helpful and the three hours free wi fi per day was very useful too.

The Stafford has the feel of an urban retreat, with an intimate atmosphere. The staff are lovely and very cool, and will do anything to help. Unlike the corporate impersonal feeling that so many hotels in big cities do, the Stafford has a really relaxed intimate atmosphere, a bit like a trendy health spa. The location in the good-looking old colonial area of The Rocks is AMAZING: 3 minute walk to Circular Quay and a further 7 min walk around the quay to the Opera House and Botanic Gardens. It's about a 20min walk up to the Pitt Street Shopping Mall. There is also a Coles Supermarket about a 20min walk away if you want to self cater. At the weekend there is The Rocks markets virtually outside your door. Restaurants and cafes and trendy shops are in abundance on the doorstep. We stayed in a studio apartment on the first floor (the breakfast room is below so if you like a lie-in opt for a room on a higher floor). It was decorated in a boutique hotel style with a bright red feature wall and big flat screen TV and stylish furniture. The kitchen was basic but well equipped for 2, with a halogen hob and a microwave oven and a mid size fridge. There is also a kettle, a toaster and free coffee and Twinings Teas. The room had a big, mirrored double wardrobe with a chest of drawers and a sturdy safe inside. You can have your room serviced everyday and will be given fresh towels everday too if you wish. The room had a little cobweb here and there, and the corners had been neglected by the vacuum, and although the grout in the bathroom was a bit grotty the standard of the room was good and it felt clean and fresh. The cleaning staff are also lovely and extremely helpful. The corridors outside the roomsare a bit drab and need renovating, which is at odds with the very funky and newly decorated look of the rest of the hotel. The reception area is lovely with funky oversized mirrors and lamps, free newspapers and comfy sofas. This leads off to a small trendy internet lounge with 2 computers ($5.50 for half an hour) and 2 comfy sofas. Very cosy! There is also a small but well equipped gym. Towels, water and a CD payer for your own music is provided. This area then leads onto the groovy breakfast room (breakfast is $15.50 per person and includes bacon, egg, cereal, juice, tea, etc). The style is modern 70s chic, with oval indonesian chairs and funky wood veneers. When breakfast is closed you can still hang out in the breakfast room which looks out onto the pool area, and help yourself to free capuccino, latte, etc. There is also free water from the cooler which is great if you're lounging by the pool. The pool leads off the breakfast room, which can open its doors right out onto the pool area. It's not a huge pool but is perfect for having fun or exercising, and is very clean and very, very warm. Clean towels are provided. There are 4 loungers with side-tables by the pool and a cushioned area to sit on around the jacuzzi. There is also an outdoor covered area with tables and chairs for relaxing with a drink if you fancy it. We often saw guests chilling out there with a bottle of wine or a (free) coffee at night.

It was large, with a separate bedroom and lounge area, and the view is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the opera house right in front of you, and the harbour bridge to your left. In fact, it was so nice that we spent most of one sunny day on the terrace, finding it hard to tear ourselves away.

Although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a busy area, the hotel itself is peaceful and quiet. It seemed to be a hotel popular with couples, as we saw no children there. One small irritation is the policy on wi-fi. You have to pay A$13+ per 2 hours. This may be fine if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need to be online several times a day, otherwise this can add up to a lot during your stay.

After about 20 minutes they said they could give us a room and by that time we were so tired we accepted. In hind sight I wish we had walked a few blocks to any of the other hotels in town but we were so tired we weren't thinking straight. I think we would have done better sleeping on the cobblestone sidewalk the bed was so uncomfortable. The sheets felt like rough sandpaper and the bed bowed into the center like a hammock with springs digging into our backs. The pillows were lumpy and smelled of mold. In fact the whole room smelled of mold and stale cigarettes. There was visible mildew on the walls around the windows. There was about a 2 inch difference between the bedroom and the bathroom floors which is very unsafe. I stubbed my toe more than once going in and out of the bathroom. We decided to check out the next day but were told there was a 2 day minimum stay. So we ended up having to pay for a night we never used. Even though we hated to waste the money there was absolutely no way we were going to stay in that room another night. My recommendation is to stay at the Intercontinental or the Shangri-La. For just a few more $ you are going to have an immensely more comfortable experience. I will say without a doubt that the Rendezvous Hotel in Sydney is by far the worse hotel I have ever stayed in.

To be fair, the room was nice enough (good size), hotel in general was fine, and location was outstanding. It was fun to stay in The Rocks area and I would suggest that anyone visiting Sydney HAS to stay in this neighborhood. Having said that, we had a HORRIBLE experience with the hotel regarding their breakfast and we do NOT recommend staying here. We are not cheap people or cheap travelers, but when there isn't a price listed for breakfast, we don't expect to be secretly charged for it. In fact, is that even legal?? We've stayed at several hotels where breakfast is included so we had no reason to think otherwise at this hotel. The flier in our hotel room read \"Please join us for breakfast\"... no price listed or any indication that it wasn't free. Then while we ate from the continental-style spread (bread, cereal and juice counter) we noted there were no signs posted whatsoever that there was a charge, and the woman checking in guests didn't mention it either. ZERO indication about any sort of fee. Thinking the breakfast was complimentary, we had cereal for breakfast each morning. Needless to say we were shocked and angry to find at check out that we were charged for said breakfasts at $15 per person per day! For cereal??!!!! We explained that we were never told of a charge and were clearly very mislead and confused. We requested some sort of compromise given that we felt so misinformed and we were not met with any sort of make-good or even any sympathy. The staff was rude and told us they were not responsible. Nice. We were furious and it took the rest of the day to mentally move on. Even now, 6 months later, I'm still angry enough to post this - I don't appreciate being tricked. And at the very least, they could have offered to refund a day's worth in an effort to compromise. I'm guessing that since we are Americans they assumed we wouldn't be returning anyway... which makes me even angrier. Definately stay in The Rocks area, but do NOT stay in this hotel.

Even though their rooms are not cheap they still screwed me for a little bit of extra profit when I stayed there from 14/2/07 to 19/02/07. When I paid the bill I was very dissatisfied with the evening receptionist\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reply when I told him unequivocally that I wanted to pay the bill in Australian Dollars (AUD). I knew my credit card company always gave the best exchange rate and I asked to pay in AUD, as I had done elsewhere in Sydney. I argued that I did not want a credit card slip showing an exchange rate and a payment in pounds Stirling. He did not seem to know what I was talking about, insisted that this was the way they always did it and the value in pounds was only a guide. I did not see the small print at the bottom of the payment slip stating that I had chosen not to pay in the local currency. On the contrary, I was insisting that I pay in AUD so either he was not fully trained or he purposely misled me. He said he could not accept payment any other way so I could do nothing as I was leaving at 6 a.m. the following morning. Needless to say, their exchange rate resulted in me paying 17 AUD more than what my credit card provider would have charged me. I stayed at 16 Hotels in New Zealand followed by one at Melbourne and Perth. The Rendezvous was the only one that pulled this well-known trick. To add insult to injury, \u00c2\u00a3526.65 was deducted from my credit card account on 18/2/07 and for some unknown reason, \u00c2\u00a3460.46 was incorrectly credited back the account the following day. I did not know about this because I did not return home to examine the statement for over 6 weeks, due to my holiday in New Zealand and then back to Australia. A later credit card statement showed they debited \u00c2\u00a3478.21 from my account, i.e. \u00c2\u00a317.75 more than they incorrectly credited to me. They credited me the money in error and then had the audacity to take an extra \u00c2\u00a317.75 when they debited it back again, i.e. I had to pay for the exchange rate change between the 2 transactions. I emailed the hotel and was pleased when the Hotel Manager, Damien Kelly, apologised for the error and agreed to refund my credit card. After nearly 2 months I have NOT received the refund and I have had no reply to my emails. E-mailing the Mr Alan Featherby, CEO, Rendezvous Hotels was also a waste of time because he has not bothered to reply. I am now waiting to see if Visa will refund the money.

Darling Harbour was also within walking distance but public transport (bus or ferry) was excellent should you rather not walk. We did the Harbour Bridge Climb which was a fantastic experience. The professionalism and safety aspects were second to none and the climb was not as arduous as I first thought. Also visited Taronga Zoo which afforded a different perspective of the harbour, and took the Bondi Explorer bus for a trip around the city which I recommend. The beach at Bondi is okay but the surrounding shops and accommodation made it look like a shanty town and it was frankly very disappointing. Excellent food at the Opera Bar on the lower concourse of the Opera House but in truth there are so many eateries to choose from. We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in this fantastic city and recommend the Rendezvous Stafford.", "Date": "October 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, FANTASTIC View\u201d", "Author": "Warrens_of_Conder", "ReviewID": "UR5934144", "Content": "We Stayed at the Rendevous Hotel on the night of the 7th of October 2006 to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary.

The room itself was a reasonable size (we were on the 5th floor), clean and tidy, with its own basic kitchenette, microwave and fridge.

The view is unbeatable for the price with great views from the Opera House all the way around to the Harbour Bridge, we could even see the bridge climbers. The room overall was comfortable and had everything that we needed (comfortable bed and a shower with heaps of pressure). Complimentary Tea and Coffee are included. Bathrooms are basic. Breakfast is next to the pool and is a basic continental but fine. I would recommend booking a room with a view as without the view its just another hotel room.

We were only a block away from Circular Quay! We were able to walk or catch the ferry to any where we wanted to go. We didn't rent a car as we were a bit intimidated about driving on the \"other side\" of the road. But it really wasn't needed. We were only in Sydney for 3 days, before we headed up north to Cairns, wish we had more time to spend . There were so many more things we could have done. We enjoyed the Zoo, and the Aquarium , like all good tourists! We also walked to the botanical gardens and while we were at the Aquarium we enjoyed Darling Harbour and the Sydney fish market. It's a pleasant walk from the Aquarium to the fish market. It's great fun to go there for lunch, fresh seafood galore! We'd definitely stay here again the next time we head to Sydney.

We were very surprised that our room on the 4th floor was ready for us to occupy - some 4 hours early. Good start! Although our balcony was tiny with just enough room to stand, it did offer us glimpses of the Opera House and Sydney Harbour which was a plus. We had a studio apartment with queen size bed which was great and our daughter slept soundly on the sofa bed. The apartment was very spacious with full kitchen facilities. I've seen better bathrooms but it did supply hairdryer. The pool was rather small but there was a spa and sauna too. The staff was fine and the free continental breakfast adequate. If you need a full breakfast, the Lowenbrau Beer Keller is just down the road and serves full breakfast all day. The hotel is positioned so close to everything The Rocks has to offer with Circular Quay just short walk away. Wynyard Station an easy 10 min walk. Other guests attending the wedding also stayed here and we didn't hear any complaints at all, even though the hotel was fully booked for most of our stay.
