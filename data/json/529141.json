I had originally booked with a booking engine and the reservation staff from the hotel contacted me in order to help me save money and assist my group with discounted private transfers.

The hotel really is a converted palace and the period features have been restored and maintained beautifully. Some of the rooms are modern and some, like the one we stayed in, are more traditional. Our room was very large and spotlessly clean with balconies overlooking the square. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was good. The breakfast buffet is simple but ample and good quality. It does not matter that there is no restaurant because the surrounding streets are full of lovely places to eat. The square is lively in the day and quiet and night. Only note of caution is that the walk from the vaporetto stop includes several bridges so you need to be able to get your luggage up and down the steps. The water taxi goes closer to the hotel but is expensive. It was a joy to wake up in our lovely room every morning and a pleasure to return to it at the end of each day.

Above all, a toaster would be great so that guests can make toast for their breakfast. Also be aware that the stairs in this hotel can be steep.

We had our two teenaged kids with us and let them know we were going out of the way to a very special city where there is really nothing like it in the world. Well... true to an extent. Massive traffic jam getting to parking gargage, completely overrun by tourists in July and mean Englishmen w/ a couple of incidents. The boat ride coming in was actually a fun one and it showed the breadth of the canals structure for what Venice is known. The stop was a somewhat confusing 10 minute walk to the hotel but the it was an oasis next to the rest of Venice. The man checking us in could not have been nicer or more informative. He helped w/ a great non-tourist restaurant and an explanation on how to get around, while chiding us that we were Japanese tourists only staying 1 night. The room was not on the front square (we had reserved a room vtoo near our stay) and it was a huge room w/ a massive King bed and a pullout couch. We negotiated sleeping arrangements and my daughter ended up on the pullout couch which collapsed due to the frailty of the mattress/support. We laughed and fixed it up as good as possible as there were no other rooms left in the hotel. It turned out fine when we realized the wood supports were simply out of place. Bathroom was big and very clean, the area was quiet as we were on an alley and we loved the old, quaint nature of the hotel. We loved coming back throughout the day on the square in front of the hotel that had nice little cafes, a small market, a beautiful church and good access to the toursist areas... while being a little quietly removed. Internet did not work up in the rooms and was a bit bizarre in a room located in back of the small lobby. Breakfast in the morning was VERY good w/ fresh fruit and delicious coffee.
