The location is very good since it is in east Berlin and it faces a metro stop and it's located at walkable distance to Alexander Platz and there are some good shops in the area. Staff is most kind and willing to help you in any issue. Breakfast is not included but for 4 euros you can have a all you can eat buffet with besides milk, cereals and jam also ham, cheese eggs and so on. Free wifi in lobby. Price was excellent ( private 4 beds bathroom ensuite for 15 euros per person per day).Highly Reccommended!!!!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot really a hostel, more like a basic, but very clean, hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "bobdibest", "ReviewID": "UR61903084", "Content": "I stayed here with a group of my friends last month. We knew it was a hostel, but weren't too sure what to expect. This is not really a hostel. The rooms are clean and big, beds comfortable, and the guests aren't really the backpacker type. There were kids, teenagers, middle aged travellers and older parties all staying here. The guest kitchen in the basement is the only indication that this is a hotel. The location is good, two metro stops and you are in Alexanderplatz. The train station is opposite the hotel, so it's very convenient. There is a little food and jewelery market just down the road on weekend mornings, and it is right in the heart of East Berlin's Bars, clubs and restaurant district. The area comes alive at night. Highly recommended. Sadly I have no pictures, but it's quite modern decor on the interior", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridgetown, Barbados", "Title": "\u201cImpressive Construction\u201d", "Author": "TravelingL", "ReviewID": "UR59519698", "Content": "This hostel is next to the S-Bahn station, not a block away 5 minutes away, next to! It seemed brand new when I stayed there in 2008 and what impressed me was the cleanliness and the precise construction of the building. The hostel's design suits it's purpose well and the lobby /lounge area draws you in. Did I mention the place was spotless?

Very significant value for money. The food wasnt that good, there was no variety of food to pick at the morning, but who cares, it's really not about eating. Just walk 3 minutes out of the hotel and take a beautiful breakfast for 6-9 euro. Its absolutely ok. The rooms are clean, well designed (ikea stuff), beautiful view... Really nice place to stay, if your are looking to be in the city center - several minutes from Alexanderplatz. Urban station right in front of the hotel.
