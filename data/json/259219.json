I choose to stay in this hotel over all of the others, including the high end luxury chains simply because it offers a superb service which the other hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have these days, regardless of star rating! On the few occasions I needed to speak to reception staff (about transport options and advice) they were very helpful. I actually went down at a peak time and although they were extremely busy checking people in and out, they gave every guest a personal and patient approach efficiently offering all they could do to help or assist- this included juggling a restaurant reservation, calling/hailing taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, even going out to retrieve luggage for arriving guests in the pouring rain before they even got out of the car! Although very busy, their ingenuity was not compromised. The three staff on duty not once batted an eyelid or huffed/puffed, they were truly lovely. The free wifi worked in the room so no complaints there, obviously in peak times it was a little slow. The room itself was spotlessly clean, linen included. The bathroom granted is no spa, however pristine and the shower itself large enough for two!.. plenty of fresh towels. No window in the bathroom, although a powerful and working air vent. The room is plain, basic, no decorative trimmings, although spacious enough for two people. Each bed (Twin room) had it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own reading light, as did the desk and of course reverse cycle air conditioning worked a treat on the hot days! No room service is offered, there is tea/coffee making facilities in the room also plenty of chic cafes/restaurants within a short walking distance (who offer take away!). It is a perfect location for Sydney because it is in equal distance to Bondi Beach or the CBD - you have the best of both worlds. $10 taxi ride to each (depending on traffic). Busses in either direction leave literally just outside the front door. There are plenty of pubs/bars/restaurants plus designer boutiques, book shops within walking distance, including the markets on a Saturday. The pool/garden area is very pleasant, quiet, relaxing place to sit in the cooler evenings. The rooms facing the garden were vey quiet too and as a light sleeper especially in a big city I appreciated this! As I left my room housekeeping arrived in the hallway, and although I had a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcno entry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign on my door handle the Japanese man was very smiley and accommodating asking me as I left if I needed anything extra like towels or did I need the bins emptied.

Sydney is quite expensive so I thought I'd try this place. My room was a little small and kind of hot.

I walked everywhere. Although its uphill so a walk back is harder than the walk there. However, this is more a by product of Sydney itself not being terribly large and not the direct area of Paddington itself. I stayed here about 4 nights and never really found a decent breakfast place nearby. I usually ended up going to The Rocks to eat dinner. The Arts is in the center of the gay district for Sydney, think Castro Street (San Francisco) which is okay, but some of the shops were a bit much and the pubs which I was excited about being located nearby from what I could tell were all gay as well. For a budget area, I'd look at Kings Cross or Potts Point. Australia was a very safe place, and I had no problem walking around Sydney alone at night and saw several young women doing the same.

Beds are decorated with circa 1980s polyester bedspreads, and cheap office furniture, bathrooms are really, really tiny and I had to leave fan on all night to try and get smell of mould out.

LOCATION: The location of the hotel is excellent ... easy walking distance to the boutique shops and cafes along Oxford Street; easy walking distance to the City, Queen Victoria Building, and Pitt Street Mall (for the shoppers); easy walking distance to restaurants ranging from Mediterranean tapas to Greek; easy walking distance to pubs and clubs; and almost next door is an arthouse cinema. If not fond of walking, bus stops are located just outside the hotel on Oxford Street. ROOM: My best friend and I stayed in room 319. The room was located on level 3 (of 3 levels) at the rear of the hotel. Although the room was small, I did not think it was too small. It had two single beds, a good sized cupboard with mirrored sliding doors, a shelf large enough for one medium suitcase, a desk with chair, air conditioning, a large window with sheer and solid curtains (that cut out the light), a wall-mounted television that had free-to-air channels and some Austar channels. The bathroom contained a toilet, shower, wall-mounted hair dryer, mirror and basin. The bathroom was small (one person could use the basin at a time). Wall-mounted liquid soap and toilet paper provided however other items such as mini shampoos, moisturisers, etc not provided. CAR PARKING: There aren't too many hotel/motels in Sydney that provide free car parking so this is a great perk ... The Arts offers free secure parking within the hotel. There are approximately 10 spaces within the car park. LAUNDRY: A laundry is located off the car park. I did not use the laundry however I assume that it is coin operated. STAFF: During our staff we dealt with two staff. Both were very friendly and helpful. NOISE: I thought that a hotel on Oxford Street would be extremely noisy due to traffic and neighbouring pubs, etc, however at no time did I hear noise from traffic or persons. CLEANLINESS: The hotel and room were very clean. SECURITY: At a certain time during the evening, the front door of the hotel is locked and entry can only be gained by reception staff (reception operates 24 hours a day). STAIRS v ELEVATOR: The hotel has stairs and an elevator. MEALS: My friend had breakfast at the hotel which looked nice (yoghurt, fruit, muesli). I am not sure if the hotel provides other meals and it does not provide room service. POOL: Sign to pool however I didn't look at it.

One thing that MUST be said about the Sullivans hotel is that it is in an EXCELLENT location. You can't beat it for the price (though not cheap, fairly cheap for Sydney).

The bathroom was adequate and clean but again, dated. The pool is freezing because it's \"solar heated\", which doesnt mean solar panel heated, just solar heated, sadly it is built in the shade apart from a few hours sun in the morning so that pool will never be warm. The blue paint has been eroded by the chemicals and comes off on your body! We told the staff and they closed the pool, yet another disappointment.

Another fab place to eat breakfast is past alexandras opposite the Shark Hotel at a place called K.K's they served delicious breakfasts including luxury muslis with homemade exotic yoghurts and fresh fruit as well as an abundance of baked goods for a fraction of what it costs to eat at the hotel. We also bought the week long orange travel pass that allows you to use the buses and the ferries as often as you wish. This worked out to be a great money saver, we certainly got our money's worth.

Excellent value for money for Sydney - a short walk from the Saturday Paddington market.", "Date": "August 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "L16gsy", "ReviewID": "UR7828596", "Content": "Booked with the hotel directly after reading reviews. They communicated effectively through emails. We decided on the hotel not knowing anything about Sydney and found it to be good value for money. We walked to the CBD a couple of times and caught the bus which was cheap and regular other times. Not much going on locally but the CBD is very close. Initial room was on the main road and found it to be very noisy, but was quickly changed to a room at the back which was very quiet. Good internet access avaiable which is free. Rooms serviced daily and they wait if you are having a lay in. Reception staff are helpful and polite. We did all the usual things whilst in Sydney, Bridge walk, Sky Tower, Bondi & Manly beaches, Blue Mountains, Hunter Valley - all very worth while and interesting and the 5 of us had a great time. Would recomment this hotel for anyone looking for value for money and pleasant service.", "Date": "June 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cNice touches\u201d", "Author": "iha", "ReviewID": "UR7548309", "Content": "This hotel is really good value for money for Sydney.
