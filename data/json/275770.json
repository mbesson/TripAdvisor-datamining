Kitchen and sofa on the ground floor, bedroom and bathroom on the first floor. The bed was comfortable enough. The area is a bit out of Rome, but connected by bus and train to the city, so there are no problems. We arrived late, after 10pm, and it was no problem at all. The receptionist was very friendly. I liked the fact I was able to pay with my American Express. Internet was good. The apartment was very well heated which was important since we were there in early February. All in all it was a great stay and I'd stay there again when I come to Rome again.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cLocated in the suburbs of Rome\u201d", "Author": "Irina P", "ReviewID": "UR125279530", "Content": "The hotel is easily accessible only with a car. The area is fenced, you can park without a problem. On the territory there are several two-storey houses with apartments. Apartments are not quite new, but for a few nights should be fine. There is a kitchen with everything you need. Outside of the wilderness. The nearest shops and restaurants far - need to go to the car.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norfolk, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing and comfortable\u201d", "Author": "Danny_2_2_10", "ReviewID": "UR122138523", "Content": "We were there for 2 nights, though short but enjoyable and relaxing. It was a bit out of Rome, but we had rented a car, so it was OK. The walls seemed a little not-so-much sound proof. We were there with a baby, the stairs seemed a little not safe due to not having proper fence. The renting did not have a breakfast included but since there was a kitchen, we were fine with it. We were told that there was no late check-in, so we had to come to the residence by 8:00pm the first night. It seemed OK, since we already wanted to come there early. I used wired internet which cable was provided in the room. I am not sure if they had wireless internet too. Overall the residence seemed alright, and if we ever plan to stay in Rome, we will go there again.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residence Santa Rosa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d275770-Reviews-Residence_Santa_Rosa-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$62 - $144*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via della Storta 591 ( Via Cassia )</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00123</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "275770", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/92/28/92284e9a162c7abe0bc440e6307bf1d39large.jpg"}}
