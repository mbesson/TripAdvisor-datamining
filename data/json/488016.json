Not too often you get a chance to enjoy nature in the middle of a tourist area! It is large enough to offer a variety of activities- small beach, watersports, pool with games and music, game room and family night activities, but it is small enough that I felt comfortable letting my kids roam around and do their own thing. THey had a great time and enjoyed the independence. I went to the spa, which I have never done before. They had a great special and I felt truly relaxed and pampered! We visited local attractions and Universal while there, enjoyed coming back to the relaxing atmosphere of the resort. THe staff was fabulous. Whether we needed extra chairs, bedding or towels, they brought them to us immediately, even at 1am! The front desk gave great suggestions and directions, answered all our questions politely! The most important thing to know when booking this resort is that if you have up to 4 people, chose the deluxe \"B\" side with the king bed and pullout sofa. It is so much bigger and nicer with a full kitchen and balcony than the smaller \"A\" units with 2 beds in the bedroom, and a kitchenette.

Star Island was the only resort available with short notice for a one day stay with the group of people we are traveling with. (We are guests of owners and travel with them at least 1-2 times a year). *Bonnet Creek is awesome...FYI!* Upon arriving at Star, we were able to check into our unit at 11am (absolutely unheard of at other resorts...so this was very good). The desk staff was very friendly and checkout went very quickly. We had a lock-off unit reserved (one side for my parents and the other side for myself and my children). As we entered the unit, the smell of smoke & mildew was really strong. My parents side didn't smell too bad, but our side of the unit was unbearable. I personally have allergies and it was just too much to stand. Basically seemed as though they had left the windows open in the rain for about a month, then closed everything up and let it sit for six months. You could even see mildew in the window seals... I called the front desk and they offered to have someone come and \"air it out\" with spray. LOL> yeah, that'll be tasty...Lysol flavored mildew with just a hint of nicotine. I told her that I needed an entirely NEW unit and she quickly accommodated to move our entire party to a new lock-off. The new unit smelled so MUCH better and had a lovely view of the elevator shaft on one side and the 40 rusty AC units on the other. Nothing like a pleasant view. :) Honestly, though- it smelled a ton better. The carpets look really clean because of all the lines from the vacuum, but upon further inspection- it ain't really clean. There was a weird brown gunk in the bathtub that I had to scrub out and there are dead bugs everywhere... the floors, the shower, the refrigerator, the sink... Not the most pleasant feeling in the world. But, hey- it's only for one night and it's a bed. AND- the pool area is really nice- actually liked it better than Bonnet Creek's pool area. A little more about the room...The dead bolt doesn't work so I'm going to sleep with one eye open. The studio unit is a ton smaller than the other part of the lock-off unit- so if you are planning on come down as two couples- somebody's gonna have to fight it out for the \"nice\" unit. The other side is about three times the size of this one, has a full size kitchen, big jacuzzi, large living area, walk-out balcony and two bathroom sinks. No, I'm not jealous....I just love my glorified hotel room with wicker furniture & a bed comforter from 1993. It's really outdated, but looks like they are trying to renovate some of the towers over time. So, in a nutshell...if you are used to a little hotel room- you'll be just fine with Star Island as long as they give you a clean room and you don't mind the outdated decor. BUT- if you are an owner and are expecting a little \"something more\"...you'll be disappointed in a BIG way.", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201ceh...\u201d", "Author": "lucy7852", "ReviewID": "UR26583153", "Content": "We were given time share points as a gift and we chose Star Island because we wanted to be near Disney. I think if we had not been given this gift we probably would have just stayed on Disney property. We were there Thanksgiving week and really enjoyed the pool and hot tub in the 3 days we were there before Thanksgiving. After that it was swamped with teenagers. The families with little kids were fine but the unsupervised teenagers annoyed me. Besides the teenagers, the pool was probably the best part. There is a lunch counter in the gift/snack shop as well as a hot dog cart next to the bar and we enjoyed lunch from both on our non-park days. You definitely do not want to do your shopping in the snack shop or even the store at the resort entrance. I forgot to pack hairspray and a bottle of it at the snack shop cost me $7. Go to Walmart to get what you need. As for the suite, we stayed in a first floor one bedroom suite. The layout was odd: the bedroom was right next to the walkway and you could hear everything. We even took a blanket and hung it over the curtain rod because the blinds weren't good enough. My husband ended up sleeping in the living room on the pull-out because other guests would use the luggage cart and roll it past our windows over the brick walkway...very loud. I would have asked for a 2nd floor had we known that. We ended up leaving the pull-out couch pulled out because the couch was more like a wicker loveseat and it was too stiff and formal to relax on. The bathroom and kitchenette were fine for the two of us. The mini fridge fit our water, beer and milk. We had to call twice to get our towels replaced but it was a holiday. I don't think a one bedroom suite is big enough for more than 2 people. We were looking forward to water sports but at the time the lake was closed because of an overgrowth of some lake plant.

I stayed in Building 23. I reserved a one bedroom deluxe-B side Feb. 28th for 3 nights.. The b-sides are the bigger unit. I was in 2333.The room was modern, clean, and spacious.It was nice. The room was 80 plus degrees when I got there, and my thermostat wouldn't cool it down. The furnace wouldn't shut off. I looked in the closet where the furnace was, and I noticed that the furnace was what is called a \"2 Zone.\" It heats and cools the A and B side. Guess who controls the furnace----- the A-SIDE. I found this out after calling maintenance in to see why I couldn't shut it off at my thermostat. Everyone that I talked to including the front desk Manager knows about this problem. It was stated to me that Wyndham Ownership is aware of this problem in all the A-B units, but simply doesn't want to spend the cash to make it right. What Star Island does, is simply wait for the complaint, and then try to move you to either an A unit, or put you in another B- that has nobody in the A side. They moved me to 2362B and nobody was in the A side. I mean, what a [--] way for a billion dollar Company like Wyndham to run an operation. Like I said, they only own a part of an expansive group of buildings at Star Island. Star Island itself is really nice and the pool area is awesome. There is a nice lounge upstairs that is open at 4pm and it overlooks the pool area. The driving range was nice to have. No need to wait for your free bucket of balls between 830 and 930. It's too crowded and it only costs 2 dollars when you pay. I simply waited for the freebie crowd to disperse. The workout facilities are also really nice. I don't work out, I golf and drink beer. Walk over to Friday's and enjoy a cold one and a burger. Like I said, my 2 rooms were both really nice and I think Star Island is a great place in a perfect location to the Disney stuff. It's a quick, easy drive to all of them. I hope Wyndham Ownership gets their act together and fixes the furnace issues in building 23. Otherwise, just get the A-side room. If you get stuck in a B with a person who needs 85 degree heat, do what I figured out. Just go into the fuse box which is in YOUR room, and turn it off.

The bedroom and the living room each had a TV. The kitchen had a mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker, utensils, plates, cups, and a small box containing some garbage bags, coffee, dishwashing detergent and a sponge. The outside of the resort is clean and the buildings are clearly numbered. We arrived at about 9pm and found parking right in front of the building. There was a luggage cart thing right by the elevators, so I brought that over, we loaded it up and were able to bring all of our luggage up in one trip. (Note - remember to return it for others to use!). Our room was clean, but there was a hint of the smell of smoke when we turned on the air conditioning. There was a washer & dryer right outside our door that I used with no problem. They're small, so they won't hold alot, but they were sufficient to clean our clothes before the return home. We didn't take part in any of the activities onsite, but we did go to the pool. We LOVED the pool. The water temperature was perfect - not freezing cold and not hot.

You'll see cleaning/maintenance people riding around in golf carts all the time, so someone is always around for assistance if need be. We had no problems at all with parking. One night, we returned at 11pm and had to park a building or two down instead of in front of our building, but no big deal - we're coming back late, so you gotta know that you'll have to park a bit further away - just like anywhere.

We were in building #25 on the second floor with two 2 bedrooms and a one bedroom that were all located together. It was nice to be close. The condos are all decorated in tacky 80's Florida. Lots of pink, brass and mirrors. Ick! The condos are in desperate need of an update. Everyone laughed at the amount of mirrors used in the master suites. Wow!!!! After the first night we all were commenting on how black the bottoms of our feet were from walking around inside the condos. Very gross!!!! I started wearing socks and the bottoms turned black quickly. On our second morning housekeeping called at 6:45am to tell us someone was on the way with the extra towels we requested. What? At 6:45am? Huh? We hadn't requested towels and it was a mix up with another building. The resort does have a lot of organized activities which we declined to partake in. We did feel very much like we were sitting at the bar every night since we could hear the goings on clearly inside our condos each night. We went to the pool once and it was very crowded at 10pm. The pool water was cloudy and the kids said it was hyper-chlorinated. The one ane only hot tub was over-run with teenagers which was incredibly disappointing. Each morning our family members staying in the other two units received phone calls from the timeshare desk offering them a quick 30 minute tour and presentation. I finally had to call and tell them to leave us all alone that we definately were not interested. The phone calls persisted. I finally stopped by the office and had a heart to heart chat with the manager and we were all left alone after that. When we checked out we had been charged for the towel service we did not request. The desk clerk was rude and I finally had to ask for a manager to get the charge removed from our bill. As VIP members this upset me greatly. I don't expect special treatment but I do think common courtesy and a smile would have gone a long way. This resort is not easy to find and a bit difficult to get in and out of if there is a lot of traffic. It is close to all the theme parks but the traffic makes the trip long at times. If there is any amount of traffic or an accident it can easily take upwards of an hour to get to and from the themeparks. We all agree that Star Island has great potential.

A decent full-sized kitchen with a huge fridge, real stove and cooktop, full-sized dishwasher, and plenty of dishes. Balcony with a view of the on-grounds lake. Nice temperature control -- very important when you come from a wussy weather area like Seattle. Decent soundproofing. Even between the two halves of our suite -- our friends did not have to listen to our toddler being cranky in the middle of the night, nor did theirs going to bed late wake ours up. We never heard anyone in the rooms next to us. Things we didn't love: The \"queen bed\" in the \"third bedroom\" turned out to be a pull-out couch and was uncomfortable to sleep on. That left us short on beds, since the only real beds were the master bedroom king and the two double beds in the 2nd bedroom. I thought they were a bit stingy with supplies. We were only given soap for two loads of laundry and two loads of dishes, two garbage bags, etc. Granted, we did not ask for more, so maybe it wouldn't have been a problem. Linens are replaced once in the middle of the week. The kitchen was a little understocked as far as pots and pans. Ok, not bad, but I would've liked a muffin tin and a few more utensils at the least. The Star Island does NOT have Internet service; you have to dial out, and there's a charge for all phone calls out. I was surprise there was no normal housecleaning, but really, even with 3 kids it's not that much trouble to pick up after yourself. One thing I was unimpressed with was the washer/dryer. Better than nothing, but those stackable units only do tiny loads. And, the dryer didn't work well at all, it either dried everything on HOT or cold, no medium air temps. Location: The location is really pretty close to the whole Disney complex -- we found it very convenient. There are tons of restaurants, a Target, Publix, and Walmart nearby for people who plan to buy food and cook or need to pick up other supplies. Lots of gift shops. Lots of designer outlet shopping. The Star Island doesn't have a shuttle to Disney, so you'll have to rent a car or pay like $20per person to get there. The Star Island grounds are pretty big so you're actually a good distance from the main drag, so a car is the better way to go anyhow. It was about 10-15 min to Disney, 15 min to Seaworld, an hour to the Kennedy Center and Cocoa Beach. Decor: A little worn, and I wasn't impressed with the glass & stone tables, especially with two toddlers in residence. Fortunately no one fell on any of the stone or konked their heads against the jacuzzi tile surround. Timeshare stuff: We did end up going to the timeshare presentation, but they didn't try to work us much. It probably helps to bring a fussy toddler but I think we were there for maybe 30 minutes, and were rewarded with $75 for going. \"Minorities housed in the back\" -- a previous review made this comment which I found to be weird and untrue. We were in building 20 right smack in the back and don't recall seeing any great concentration of minorities there. We were \"assigned\" our unit number when we booked, which was done in total anonymity via the Internet! Overall, this was our first resort experience, and we were pleasantly surprised.

The people there are very nice. The 2br is a lockout. The connecting doors wouldn't stay open, there is a spring on the hinges. I didn't like this because the younger children stayed in that \"2nd bedroom\" and were really seperated from us. The bathtub is almost thigh high so it is very difficult to step in and out of and the water preasure is not the greatest. The fan in the bathroom is extremely loud. The pool is small and the activities were poor. The elevator still makes a scary noise. Now for the really bad stuff. The first morning we woke up 6am to bugs in our bed and bites all over our upper bodies. We called the front desk and spoke to management. They wanted to move us to a different room 3 building over. We had groceries and all of our things to move. My husband spoke to the operations manager, telling her that many villas in our building were vacant, why can't we move within our building. She checked and allowed us to move one room over. The old room was exterminated and vacant for the rest of that week. We left one of the bugs in a ziploc bag to help them identify it. The new room...no bugs but the toilet was not bolted to the floor. This resort is very old but does have alot of potential. The location is excellent. I more than likely will not stay here again.

Before we arrived I called Fairfield (or what ever they changed their name too) because I was concerned about the beds in the unit. (2 full size and a queen pull out) They said this was the only unit available. So we sucked it up and made the best of it. We were given our key and sent way to the back of the facility. We were also told that they would give us a call because we were VIP owners. They wanted to take about 1/2 hour of our time to update us on the all of the changes. We know they can't tell time (except for check in and out) so we didn't fall for that. We didn't answer the phone!!! Our \"lock off\" unit was located on the ground floor. The unit was clean and nicely decorated. The beds were small. That was a big problem. I am 5'10\" and my husband is 6'8\". We didn't fit. The pull out bed was so uncomfortable, we ended up dragging the mattress into the front room and using the sofa cushions to complete our bed. Well sleeping in the front room had it's disadvantages. Between the noise outside the window from walk by traffic and the daily activities from next door, ( paper thin walls) sleep was low on the priority list. What is up with the exhaust fan!!!! The jacuzzi was small but I guess it served it's purpose. We didn't get a chance to take a dip in the pool. Due to lack of sleep we snoozed late, the pool was too crowded. Something else we noticed, we only saw minorities in the back housed toward the rear of the facility. Maybe it was our imagination but that was the only place we saw them. Anyway the resort is located right in the middle of every and anything you want to eat. I love the location but as I said before it needs better location indicators. It was easy to get to all of the attractions. My biggest problem was I didn't feel like I was treated like a VIP owner.(what ever that is suppose to be) Now that I know what a \"lock off\" unit is I will never stay in a \"GROUNDFLOORONEBEDROOMLOCKOFFUNIT\" (that's how close we were!) again!!!!", "Date": "April 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing stay for hectic Orlando!\u201d", "Author": "kewlfivePennsylvania", "ReviewID": "UR7191675", "Content": "I felt compelled to write a review about Star Island... I am a Fairfield owner, and I read the other reviews. I booked our stay, but was somewhat anxious about our stay... Our stay started out by being given keys to a room that was already occupied. I was very upset, as was my husband. We had unpacked all of our belongings from our vehicle, and all six of us were standing in a room that wasn't ours, with multiple suitcases and tired from our entire day of traveling... That being said, when we went back to the front desk, the clerk appologized profusely. That was our ONLY bad experience with Star Island. (My husband was also upset because we usually could not park right in front of our building.) However, our entire week was a blast at Star Island. I purchased 7day tickets to Disney, and only used 4 days. We spent the other days at the resort. A huge super Walmart is 1 1/2 miles away. (Check out Walmart's Disney section for Disney t-shirts, etc before you spend all of your hard-earned dough at Disney!) The kids volunteered to miss MGM Studios so they could use the pool. The pool was very kid-friendly, and was heated (which was appreciated during our early-March visit). We enjoyed the poolside activities also, such as build your own sundaes, who can make the biggest splash, noodle races, etc. Charlie Chaplain roams around in the morning, and makes balloon animals, hats, etc. for the kids. There is also a moon bounce set up for the kids to use for free. Our room overlooked the tennis courts. I enjoyed sitting on our 5th floor balcony in the morning, and watching the tennis instructor with his students. Star Island has a driving range, which my husband and children really enjoyed. If you go at a certain time, they give you a free bucket of balls. (You will be given a list of all activities when you check in.) The decor in the room suited us fine. My husband's not into pink, but we enjoyed the huge jacuzzi bathtub in our bedroom. I also enjoyed the huge shower! We had a 2 bedroom lock-off unit. The den on the smaller side had a sofa-bed, which my teenage son turned into a bedroom for himself. There is so much to see and do in Orlando, and the traffic is horrible. However, I really was able to relax and unwind at Star Island.

We stopped by Star Island that I had checked out online before we left. We got a room for the remaining 5 night stay for only $55 a night if we would listen to a time share speil. The room: It was spacious. It was not terribly clean. It was not an efficient layout. The kids had to sleep on a pull out bed that was so uncomfortable that we called for an extra mattress and they slept on the floor. The sheets on the king bed were cheap and scratchy, and the mattress pad was way too small and synthetic and moved around and bunched up at night. The pillows were terrible and very cheap. You about had to kill yourself getting into and out of the large jacuzzi tub, as it was poorly laid out with no step in our out, so you had to walk along the slick marble edging to get out or in. Also, we ran out of hot water before it was filled up completely. The stand up shower did not drain properly and always had some water in it. The toilet continually ran and made noise. The decore was out of date 80's Floridian. Our room key locked us out the second to last day. We called and let them know and asked if they would have it working by the time we got back from Disney the following day. We got back late on Friday and guess what? It was still not working. My husband had to go to the front desk who didn't offer an apology, and we had to wait in the car for about 15 minutes until security showed up to open the door. We never had a room key that worked the rest of the time we were there. We just didn't leave the room again without some in it to open the door. The walls were so thin that we could hear the small children crying and making noise next door. The loud Kaoreoke music at the pool EVERY night until 11 was heard as if in our own living room. The kids had a hard time going to sleep. You had to pay $25 a day for maid service, extra towels and toilet paper. There was no internet hook up in the room, and you had to pay extra for the one they had in the lobby. They even charged 75 cents a call for local calls. This hotel does not seem 5 star to me. I think whoever gave them the 5 star rating is watering down the rating system. How can you trust the star ratings if this is 5 star? The time share presentation: Lets see. It was supposed to take 90 minutes and offered a free breakfast. Well, the breakfast and coffee were inedible. The salesman was \"just there to help us\", and \"this isn't a high pressure sales pitch. You can go whenever you want, as I have many people waiting who are wanting to buy\". 3 hours later, we had repeatedly said we weren't interested, they kept saying they would give us 1 more minute alone to discuss it, kept offereing us a \"better deal\", and when we finally had kids doing headstands and we were getting up to leave anyway, they were noticably not happy with our refusal, even though it was \"no pressure\". There went half of Wednesday. It was a small price to pay though for $55 a night, even if the place was 4 star at best. When I went to check out the staff was not very friendly. When I asked for a receipt, they couldn't help me since it was a time share deal. When I went to the time share office no one was there, so I left without one. I have no idea what all they are charging me at this time. In closing, I thought the place was spacious but outdated and not very well laid out. It wouldn't be worth the almost $300 nightly rate at all. They nickle and dime you to death, and you do not feel you are at a top notch resort at all.

I arrived at about 2 PM, well before the 4 PM check in time. The front desk person took my cell phone number, \"in case the room is ready early.\" About 3:15 I went back to the front desk to inquire about the room, and was told it was ready. Never received the promised phone call. I was given a \"lock-out\" A room, way in the back of the facility. I was told that I was lucky, as it \"overlooks the lake.\" Well, what it overlooked was a walkway and maintenance sheds. The bedroom window overlooked a stairwell. Therefore, not only could anybody walking by look in if the blinds were opened, it was noisy due to passers-by and echoes in the stairwell. By the way-all the employees I encountered were unfailingly polite and friendly. The Room The room was nice, clean, and fairly spacious. The beds were really too small to sleep 2 apiece. And the pillows were horrible. Also, the jacuzzi was useless; not only did the low-set jets bang my kidneys, but between the noise of the jets, and the noise of the exhaust fan, you could go deaf! Unfortunately, the walls must be paper thin; I could hear every sound made by the family next door. And when they would run their washing machine at 11:40 PM, it would sound like a truck was going through my room. For some reason, when I arrived back from Epcot my last night, my room card key had been canceled, and I had to wait for security to come and let me in. Just symptomatic of the poor organization here. By the way, I always found a parking space near the elevator for my unit. The Resort As I said, the grounds are beautiful. Also, there seems to be plenty of activities during the day and night. The Pitch I had a 3 night/4 day business gift to stay here. When I called to confirm, I was told I could get another day if I went to a \"1 1/2 hour to 2 hour presentation.\" Little did I know what I was getting into! I was scheduled for the pitch my second day, in the early afternoon (thus effectively killing the day), at another location: Bonnet Creek. Well, that is one fantastic resort. But the pitch lasted a grueling 3 1/2 hours! The Location The resort is located off a rather tacky highway. But the good part is, if you are so inclined, there are many national fast food places there, and nearby CVS, Publix, a giant Wal Mart (the place to pick up your souvenirs!), etc. Also, it is near Old Town, other main arteries, and fairly close to Disney. If you need a Chabad House, there is one about 15 minutes away, with daily services. If you don't know what Chabad is, you don't need it! ;-) My Conclusion I was really annoyed by the day killed by the pitch, and the location of my room. The noise was very unpleasant. So I wouldn't say this is a top place.

Star Island wasn't even in the same league as the HGVC in my opinion. Their 3 bedroom unit was a 2 bedroom with a 1 bedroom lock-off. (Not the case at HGVC) The 3rd bedroom wasn't really a bedroom, a pull out sofa. Very dated, typical florida decor... green, pink, lots of mirrors and fake marble. A little to cheesy for me. I found it odd that for a unit that could hold as many as 8 people they had only 1 sofa that could comfortably seat maybe 4 people. That's it. No chairs. There was a big empty space where it seemed like chairs should be but there weren't any. Again for a max of 8 people they provided a dining table that held 6. No light darkening curtains on any window. The 2 windows in the pull-out \"bedroom\" faced onto the exterior hallway which was lit all night long so that room was quite bright during the night. It seemed clean with the exception of 1 creepy crawly roach type guest. The bathroom in the lock-off portion looked like it may have been recently re-done. It just didn't quite match the rest of the decor. It also had a very odd jacuzzi shower combo where the tub was raised up quite bit. My husband is 5'9\" and he had to duck his head to get under the shower. Anyone much taller might have to duck to avoid the ceiling. Kind of weird. Big gaps around the exterior doors.

If our unit had backed up to live music all night long I would have freaked. Luckily we weren't right next door to it.
