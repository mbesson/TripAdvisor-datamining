It was clean, and the staff was friendly. There is a pleasant rustic feeling to the room design,terracotta tile floors, etc. The hotel structure is welcoming for a family with kids or for any group, as it is low rise, and the rooms all lead to the courtyard which has a decent restaurant, and a pool. There is an excellent beach nearby -- As I recall it was crashboat beach? WHatever the case, this beach was one of the nicest in all of Puerto Rico, and there is a shuttle from the hotel to the beach if you don't want to drive. I never tried the pool and don't remember if it was clean; why would you use a pool when you have beaches? From Aguadilla, it was a short trip to the caves, or Rincon, or Cabo Rojo. If you want to see San Juan, you can drive there, but it is a hike, and the Rain Forest, El Junque, is so out of the way that we did not attempt it. The only problem with this hotel is finding it in the first place, as it is very poorly marked.

We were suppose to stay at the suites for 3 nights and stayed 1 night (because there was nothing else available). We moved to the parador for the other 2 nights. The rooms at the suites are old and the worst part is that it is dirty and musty.we did not even check the rest of the facilities. We were showed 2 different rooms and they both were simply awful. The parador has an open and airy lobby that is rustic and welcoming. Some of the rooms have not been renovated but they are clean and in much better condition than the suites. They have a newer bldg were the rooms have been renovated and are lovely. It is located in a more convenient area with access to restaurant, hospital, church, beach and not far from the mall and other attractions.

First, one door to the room did not close completely and only one of the safety latches worked. All three room had doors that did not reach the floor and had large gaps allowing bugs to get in. The two fire detectors in my room had no batteries inside. The others did not check but we suspect they didn't work either. There was no security at all present on premises--only one front desk clerk, two restaurant staff and a few housekeeping staff. With the hotel being set in a wide open outdoor spaces (and heavily wooded areas) and it opening up to random run down shacks, the hotel was not safe. At night, the courtyard areas where one walks back and forth from the front desk and pool/restaurant area to our rooms had little to no lighting--making the whole area dark and susceptible to safety issues. The block of the building we were placed in were in the back corner of the hotel and our doors out of view of any hotel staff or security if there was any (and walking up to the building again was dark and not lit). Aside from those security problems we saw, the rooms themselves were just dirty. The tiles had lots of grime and most specifically mold on them and the bathroom looked like gas station bathrooms with cracks and tiles broken off. At night, there were roach activity as well. The furniture was made of unpolished wood and had many splinters and any metal furniture rusted. The WiFi was non-existent and everyone had issues logging on, and it just didn't work. The staff was indifferent and once it got dark, we felt unsafe to venture out of our rooms so we just stayed in. It felt like we were locked down. No where else have I experience a crew property this dismal and unsafe. It was near the beach. In addition, the previous review about one towel per room is pretty much true. They do shampoo and soap in truck stop style dispensers mounted on the wall. The sheets being thread-bare was true too. I itched the whole night sleeping there. The pool was clean and had no odor while I was there.

We stayed with a tour group on January 19 and checked out on January 22. Although we were told it was a year old hotel, Formely Ramey Base, it was not so new. They painted the old barracks of the military base, but did not remodel anything else. The towels in all the rooms were worn out with the seams all flaky, some had holes on them. They did not have wash cloths either. A friend was told the bathrooms had hair blowers, but we could not find one bathroom with a hair blower or an electric outlet!

We needed to play with the faucet in the shower to get hot water, one of the guests did not have hot water at all and his TV was not working. The first night the restaurant was closed to the public because of a meeting/rally of a politician (I believe Fortuno) and the fight of Tito Trinidad. The next morning the restaurant was closed until 10:30 because the cook who was the only one with a key stayed too late due to the fight the night before.

She told us we had a choice of coffee or juice, not both, and toast and fruits. When I asked what fruits she answered \"Peaches\" from a can. The coffee was cold and we were not offered a second cup.

I am originally from Aguadilla and had heard good things about El Faro. Since my flight was coming in very late, my sister and I decided to get a hotel room and rest before continuing on our vacation the following day. I was not able to book a room on line, so I called the hotel and asked if they had anything available. They said absolutely they had a double room available for a rate of $80. Although I thought the price was a little high for a hotel in Aguadilla I was confident that I would be getting a good room (the pictures on the web were very nice) where I woud feel safe and get a good nights rest. When I got there the reception gave me my key and said the room was down and to the right. We grabbed our bags and started walking, we searched all throughout the two wings of the hotel but could not find our room. When we went back to ask, we were told that our room was in a tiny building about 100 yards from the main hotel in the corner of the property. We get to the room and the air condinitoning was completely turned off, there was mold on the ceiling and it looked old and worn down. I immediately called the front desk to ask that they switch our room, but they said they were completely booked. Needless to say, I got sick from my allergy to the mold, and did not sleep very well since I did not feel very safe. The next morning I complained again, and the only explanation given was that they were very busy. I understand that hotels get booked up, but my problem is that I was given a very different impression of what I would be getting and was never told that I was getting a room in the corner of the property that was second rate.
