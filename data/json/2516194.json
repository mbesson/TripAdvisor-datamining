The food at the lobby bar (try the buffalo chicken salad or western hamburguer) is very good. Sometimes there are too many people for the one single waittress attending (who is very kind), but overall, when you ar sitting there watching a game, is not a big deal if waiting a little more for your food.

Sedona, Grand Canyon, Page, then back to The Grand Canyon. The last night we wanted to stay closer to the airport so we chose Radisson Hotel Phoenix Airport North. It is conveniently located a short drive from the rental car return complex. We checked in on a late Thursday afternoon and were greeted promptly and friendly. The lobby and hotel appeared immaculate, and our room was no different. We were very pleased with it. The wireless internet was blazing fast. The only slight issue was that if you wanted a mini refrigerator in your room you could ask for one and pay extra for it. (There were several lined up in the hallway) Since we would only be there one night it was not a big deal at all, I got the cooler out of the car and used the ice machine. Seeing as we were wrapping up a busy week our plan was to catch up on work emails, eat dinner in the hotel restaurant, and then kick back in the room with a few cold ones. That plan worked out very well. The restaurant was (completely) empty. The service was very good as were the nachos. My burger was decent. I forgot what my wife ordered but she liked it. The fries were really good. The beds were very comfortable and we slept well. Our flight was not until about 11:30AM and we had a pleasant, fast checkout about 9:30AM. Good thing we left early! It was raining when we were checking out so I pulled the car around front to be under the overhang. We had to rearrange some items in the luggage so I took it out of the car and shuffled. The woman at the hotel desk gave us printed, easy to follow directions including a place conveniently on the way to top off the tank. The drive was about 5-8 minutes. Once we got to the rental car return I realized I made a BIG mistake! When I was shuffling luggage I placed my laptop bag on the ground leaning against a pole about 25\u2019 outside the hotel\u2019s front door. Inside that bag were our tickets, passports, and GPS amongst other important items. To say the least I panicked! I called the hotel and the woman who answered the phone (same one who checked us out) said \u201cMay I please put you on a brief hold\u201d. My instant reply was \u201cNo please!!\u201d. She graciously then asked how she can help me. I told her that we just checked out and I left my laptop bag outside the front door and was babbling something when she said \u201cDon\u2019t worry sir. I have it right here, someone turned it in\u201d. I thanked her and said I\u2019ll be right there. When I walked in the front door of the hotel she saw me coming and handed me my laptop bag over the counter. I thanked her and bolted back to the rental car return where my wife was waiting. We had no problem catching our flight home to NY. I was extremely impressed with the staff and would like to say THANK YOU again. Our whole trip was great and I would have hated for it to end of a really bad note. Being (very) close to 50 years old and never having done something like that before it is nice to see there are nice people out there. I would like to also thank the person who turned in my laptop bag. That was a great thing that you did and I truly appreciate it.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNever again\u201d", "Author": "CharterHotelLady", "ReviewID": "UR128931878", "Content": "Great dissapointment but shouldn't have been surprised since it was \"cheap\" and previous reviews were not great.

So I dragged my bag out into the 100 degree heat to wait. At 2:30 I fronted up and was given a room - no smiles. Elevator carpet filthy dirty; room comfortable appearing, bed and bath linens dingy gray, neither crisp nor fluffy. Following morning made a number of attemps to log-on to internet as my rate supposedly included. No luck and no joy from reception, where they suggested it was due to hi-demand by other guests. If your band-width or whatever cannot accommodate guests when your property is heavily booked then close out the rates that include this amenity. It's pretty simple!

I am a regular guest at establishments such as The W, Renaissance, Kimpton, and Westin (or most Starwood Hotels). After researching hotels and prices in the Phoenix area for a business trip, I kept going back to this Radisson property. I was reluctant because the price seemed too reasonable for the amenities offered, and for the excellent reviews....too good to be true, maybe? I took the chance, and booked my stay, and am so pleased that I did. The rooms, as well as the entire property were very, very clean. It is apparent that this is important to them. Gabina was a sweetheart, and payed attention to the \"Do not disturb\" sign.They were also efficient in their communication to housekeeping as to my late check out. Not a difficult thing, but doesn't always happen that way at other hotels. Nicole and Jenny at the front desk were very courteous, and went above and beyond being helpful and were very efficient. They are an asset to this hotel, and I hope that they are recognized for their efforts. I liked the fact that there was a restaurant on site, as well as a bar area. The food is very reasonably priced, but not the drinks....a bit over priced. Room service was fast, and the food was hot and tasty. Complimentary internet throughout the hotel, as well as a complimentary business center that provides four or five computers for guests were an added value, if you didn't travel with a laptop, etc. The 24 HR airport shuttle service is also great. They run a timely, efficient operation, and the driver was a gentleman. I feel bad that I do not remember his name....

Also, you get vouchers to cover breakfast in their cafe, but you are expected to tip at each meal, unlike RI. Thirdly, they don't have a \"market\" like RI, so you can't buy a quick meal to microwave or get an ice cream bar at night. Also, their air conditioner is very loud and goes on and off during the night. If you turn it off, of course it will get very warm very fast.

Julien was very combative and showed an extreme lack of respect for my situation. He didn\u2019t offer any solutions. I became very upset over this. I had not chosen this hotel, it was the hotel the airline used for distressed passengers, and they were not able to accommodate guests in this condition. I was unable to sleep a decent amount of time because of all of this. The room and tax was paid for by the airline. So I ask: why are the staff not trained to read the situation of a guest?

Then I called front desk to find out if any rooms were available with the Sleep Number Bed and she was more than happy to accommodate me. She said all I had to do was come back to the front desk to get the Key to the room. The new room was two doors down from the previous. The room was very clean and the decor was eye pleasing. The computer chair at the desk was so comfortable I wanted to take it home LOL. The bathroom was VERY clean not a single strand of hair was on the floor and mirror was spotless.

I had planned on leaving the room at 6:30 but couldn't and I didnt receive my jacket until 7! Another thing was that the water from the bathroom sink was too hot. Before we left to go out on the town we ask the front desk clerks what events was going on for the night and all pitched in with events which was very helpful. They even informed us about the forms of transportation offered in the area. My final morning we had breakfast at the buffet and we were greeted with a smile by the hostess. Breakfast was very good but the pancakes were hard so I opted for the Waffles which was self served (waffle iron on the buffet line). They had a great selection of breakfast items and drinks available. One thing I really liked was the express check-out. When I woke up on my last morning, my receipt was slid under the door.

We asked if they could please move us to a room with a sleep number king that was smoking or move a sleep number bed into that room.

My observations: 1. SHUTTLE: If you stay at the Radisson near the airport and call for a shuttle, MAKE SURE you tell the driver you are staying at the Radisson Airport North. There are two Radisson hotels near the airport, and the driver did not ask us about which hotel we were registered--we had no idea there were two of them! When the shuttle arrived (after two calls), he took us to the WRONG Radisson hotel. I would have normally just stayed at the hotel where we were taken, but since I booked a special deal, I was obligated to stay at Radisson Airport North. The driver then did not want to drive us to the correct hotel. After 45 minutes of waiting at the\"other\" Radisson, his manager convinced him to take us to the Airport North. 2. SHUTTLE PART 2: There is no 24 hour free shuttle at this hotel. They begin the shuttle service at 5 am, so if you have a 6 am flight you better plan on spending $15 for a 3 mile taxi ride. 3. CUSTOMER SERVICE: The second time I stayed here the front desk clerk was outside smoking a cigarette. After 5 minutes of puffing away he showed up and checked us in. While I don't have a degree in Hotel Management, I thought this was unacceptable---especially since he was in full view of the front desk from his smoking area outside. 3. ROOMS: Clean and comfortable. The rooms come with a \"Sleep Number\" bed so you can adjust the bed to your liking. 4. BREAKFAST BUFFET/RESTAURANT/LOUNGE: It wasn't free, but the breakfast buffet had a good selection of hot and cold food. Service in the restaurant (both dinner and breakfast) was good. The lounge also had good, attentive staff. While the rooms were comfortable and I genuinely liked the restaurant and its staff, those components don't make up for waiting 45 minutes for a shuttle driver to take us to the correct hotel or a front desk clerk who attaches more importance to his cigarette than his job.

But the disability accommodations in the shower that were extremely problematic. The built-in tile seat at the end of the shower farthest from the shower head and controls was a bit too far to be reached by the shower head on the hose. The shower head on the hose was so difficult to turn on and to figure out how to turn on that we had to call the maintenance person -- who couldn't figure out how to turn it on, either. Finally, my husband figured it out -- accidentally. The shower curtain wasn't long or wide enough to contain the water and so the floor got flooded. There was always ice water in the lobby and that was wonderful because it was so incredibly hot outside. Although I had made a special call directly to the hotel to make sure that the disability accommodations would work for us and to make sure that we would have a fridge waiting for our medications and that all feather pillows had been removed, when we arrived there were feather pillows on the bed, no fridge, and the shower had the problems I mentioned above. AND they had no record of my calls and requests. VERY annoying -- but, alas, very common. Still, the staff responded as quickly as they could to the problems, corrected them as well as they were able, and made sure to give us a first floor room.

There are few places to eat at nearby. There is a restaurant onsite and they do offer room service but there wasn't anything so appealing on the menu. I traveled with my 15mo old and my husband but we didn't stay in a suite which would probably have been a much better choice with a young child - the room was nice although the bathroom (one of my pet peeves) was certainly lacking in some areas. The toilet ran every time you used it and the handle fell off or was close to falling off on each occasion (I even had to take the top off the tank in order to fix the handle once - not what you'd expect on a hotel stay) and the tub spout dripped and dripped, there was some noticeable ceiling damage and peeling wall paper...Room service was quick but the food was filling more so than appetizing. While we were there they must have had some sort of leak or someone spilled water on the floor because they had a large fan outside our door for probably 12 hours or more drying the carpet. I liked the room decor when I viewed it online and it met my expectations in that regard. Everything outside of the bathroom seemed very well taken care of. One thing to keep in mind is that although they serve breakfast in the mornings, it is by no means complimentary. To summarize we stayed two nights for $48.00 a night, we had a king sleep number bed which was nice too. I would consider staying there again for the price we paid (I wonder if they put priceline guests in rooms that aren't as nice or have issues?)but in a different room. I enquired about the suites and was first told they did not have any suites or any rooms with refrigerators, they later said they did have suites and I could upgrade for an additional $40.00 per night...not bad considering that the suites were supposedly going for $169.00 per night during our stay but we were only staying one more night so we decided to stay put instead of lugging all our stuff (and a sleeping baby) to a new room in them middle of the night.", "Date": "May 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "home", "Title": "\u201cReally nice place and quiet on the weekend.\u201d", "Author": "tampabobl", "ReviewID": "UR7539524", "Content": "Stayed here for one night prior to a flight out the next morning.

There was also free wi-fi which is very impressive for any hotel not to tack on an additional charge. Since I was tired, I did the quick walk to the Chinese cultural center and had dinner at the bar at the Golden Buddha. This is not your typical Chinese restaurant: the clams in spicy garlic sauce were amazing! So was the crispy quail appetizer.

The room was almost perfectly clean (and I think there is no better complement for a hotel than that) The forward Hilton-like space maximizing design of the room was nice as well. The sleep number bed was great. The shuttle to the airport takes eight minutes (I timed it) One other great thing about this place is the proximity to this Asian cultural center food area/office complex two blocks north of the hotel. It is hard to see from the road. When you get past the Chinese garden and walk in the arches you discover a whole asian mall full of Chinese restaraunts and a vietnamese superstore. The only problems I could see would have to be the lack of a business center. That is pretty inexcusable for an \"airport\" hotel. Especially since they can make it pay for itself if they want to. Another issue might be the staffing at the counters. They were nice, but they really needed a couple of extra people when I was there.
