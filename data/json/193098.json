We noticed later on that there was a queue for breakfast so getting there early was a good idea. Also made use of the pool which was a bit cold at first but soon got used to it. Towel hire was free but you need a pad lock for the lockers. Leisure reception only had 1 spare so my husband and son kept their stuff by the side of the pool which was a bit annoying. Tube was a bit of a hike but after speaking with the staff, we got a bus straight to Oxford Circus and they run every 5-10mins.

My wife went to reception to ask for tea coffee explain about the room and tell them the phone was broke. They said the room had not been made up as we did not show for the previous nights stay. So my wife explained the situation again and reception said they would bring the tea and coffee to us. After 40 minuets and nearing 00.30 hours we were still waiting.

I got a great deal on LastMinute.Com through the secret hotels offer. It was so cheap for a central hotel in London on N Y Eve, I was amazed and simply had to book it. The hotel is centrally located within walking distance from Old Steet tube, plus there are several night bus stops close by as well. It's a little tricky to find and you suddenly come across it as you walk there. It's kind of in the middle of a residential area close to a council estate. The lobby is huge and posh. The reception staff are efficient and friendly. I stayed in a room opposite the reception, meaning you walk across a terrace and use your room card and enter another block. I found this to be fine. I took the lift to my room and was delighted with it. It was clean, well presented and very nice-looking for a London hotel. ( I have stayed in many London hotels in the 3-4 star range and few are as good as this..most are old and drab as that is the way London hotels are....) I had a TV with all cable channels, instant coffee/tea and kettle and free toilettries in the bathroom. The shower worked well, the room had decent sound proofing, the bed was comfy and I really liked it. I also felt safe (being a female). The hotel is quite big and tonnes of rooms line the corridor. The room is fairly small but not unusually so - the regular size of London four star hotels is small, but it wasn't too small. The concierge was really friendly and helped me with all my travel queries and seemed really knowledgeable about everything from taxis to buses - he was impressive. The only downside of this hotel is the location - in the sense it does border a council estate and at night, in the dark, you would not want to walk back from Old Street tube alone (at least not after 11pm). Having said that, it is only a 10-15 min walk and if you did walk back (as I did at 3am) it's unlikely anything will happen. The problem is there aren't that many people wandering around...on N Y Eve there were but that was an exception. I would suggest you get a cab home if walking back alone. There is a nightbus stop closer than the tube, but not that close and still a walk through some dark roads.. The breakfast the next day consisted of a help yourself buffet - scrambled eggs, croissants, pain au chocolats, make your own toast, fruit, fruit juice, coffee and tea - and some other stuff I didnt have...It was very nice and filling and breakfast staff were very attentive and professional and the ambience on N Y Day was great. It was heaving by the way. It's a popular hotel and lots of people stay there. The best part about this hotel is the pool though. There is an amazing indoors heated pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi that is just unspeakably good...I spent an hour in there relaxing and detoxing - I felt so great afterwards. The fact you get to use this for free if you stay in the hotel is unbeatable. You can swim proper lengths, and it's not the crowded. It's clean and really really nice. I love this place and would go back for sure. The concierge looked after my stuff as well when I checked out and I came back and collected it. Everything about this hotel is great.

The hotel is located about 10 minutes walk from the Barbican station and about a \u00c2\u00a35 cab ride if you prefer not to walk. Reception is well presented & modern and the staff were welcoming and found our reservation with ease; a glitch in the website meant that I was unable to book breakfast with the room and had to pay for that at check-in. \u00c2\u00a310 per person per day which if you eat like a horse is good value, there are plenty of small cafe's nearby if you prefer to eat out. My double room was on the first floor of the hotel and easily accessed by the lifts. Corridors on the first had a musky unpleasant smell to them, it was a combination of a food & damp smell. My first reaction when entering the room was how small it was; this was the smallest double room I'd stayed in and I spent about 4 months a year in hotels around the world. The bathroom was big enough to be functional but not so big as to enjoy with someone else, if you know what I mean here. As you will see in the photo's the room was very clearly in need of urgent refurbishment and was barely hanging together. What I couldn't show you in the photos was the bathroom floor where about 60% of the floor tiles had no glue fixing them to the floor; they just rattled about when you walk in there. The carpet in the room was threadbare and long past serviceable. The room does not have a mini bar and the space for the fridge was just an empty void which we thought would be useful for suitcases of other large fridge shaped objects. You can use your imagination here. There was no air conditioning in the room and you could switch the radiator on which turned the room into an over or open the window and you froze from the wind whistling in. I really don't expect a modern hotel in London not to have AC in the rooms, maybe 20 years ago perhaps. The bed had no cover to the divan and again from pictures I've added you can see what I hoped were water marks and not urine on the divan. The mattress had no mattress protector which meant that I was able to smell all the sweat from the many hundreds of guests who'd used that room before me. Breakfast was a decent choice of hot & cold, tea, coffee and fruit juices. But, as I've said before the \u00c2\u00a310 charge is acceptable if you eat like a horse. If I stayed again I would use the many local cafe's instead. We had an evening meal 1 night in the hotel and after a wait of 10 minutes our drinks arrived and then after 48 minutes our meals arrived. With about 10 other covers in the restaurant this is a grossly unacceptable wait. To summarise my review; this is a functional hotel in need of urgent refurbishment and modernisation. Based on my frequent use of hotels across London & the rest of the World I don't feel that I got value for money and left with a feeling that once you scratch beneath the shiny veneer of reception the quality drops off a cliff. With the shabby & threadbare state of my room cleanliness will always take a hit and that is unacceptable in my option.

While it was not perfect (no place is), it was far far far from that. Although I did get lost, I needed a taxi to get me there, check in was a breeze, my room was large and clean, with a perfectly adequate bathroom with extra towels in the wardrobe. I only had time to run in and out again as I was late to get to a concert, partly because I got lost, partly because of it not being that simple to find and partly because I had not realised that the traffic was so dreadful. I got lost again going to the concert which was my reason for being in that part of town in the first place, a young woman came out of a fast food shop and helped me part way stay on course and I managed to flag another taxi, so I only missed the first fifteen minutes, along with quite a few other folks. Excellent concert, I have to say. I didn't make the mistake of risking getting lost again, so when I came out of the venue, I flagged a cab and a super driver took me back. When I got to my room, I realised I had forgotten to eat all day. I looked at the room service menu and decided to order, I had prepaid for my room and breakfast so I had no need to set up a tab, but they were fine with my paying cash. Be aware, there is a \u00c2\u00a35 charge for them bringing the food to your room, which they explained before I ordered, even though it is not on the room information. The person I spoke to told me how long I would have to wait and a very cheerful and polite young man brought my meal to me and returned with my change, but he lost out on a tip due to the \"Tray Charge\", I'm afraid, I enjoyed my food and glass of wine very much. Everything works in the room, although the TV left a little to be desired in the tuning stakes. The bed and pillows were fine, crisp linens, extra pillows in bags in the wardrobe and nice lights that come on when you open the doors. I didn't sleep all that well, but that's not the fault of the hotel, I simply don't sleep well ever. Great shower in the morning, the towels were soft enough and big enough. Then I went down for breakfast. Lovely staff, although they were clearing a little too efficiently, so I only got up to collect stuff from the buffet (I would suggest getting down for breakfast a bit earlier than I did, as things were a little dry from the lights by 9am) and things vanished before I'd finished, like my glass of water, but another appeared before I had sat back down again. I would recommend booking off the Thistle website, my booking was the same price and included breakfast as room only on booking sites. All I needed to do was hand my key in as I left and, yes, I got lost again on the way to find a Number 4 busstop. I found the hotel staff helpful, friendly and professional, without exception. I am usually good at finding my way around but I found that area really difficult to negotiate, so if you are in the same kind of rush I was in, put some money aside for taxis.

The Hotel although was very clean and the staff excellent was out on a limb and to use public transport involved at 15 minute walk for either underground or bus and returning at night in a not very good area wasn't good. London Taxi's are very expensive with a minimum charge of \u00c2\u00a315 just to get to the train station (Euston) and to much to mention to get back from the West End. so this extra cost has to be factored in to the cost.

Never again. The walk from Barbican tube station isn't too bad other than the areas you are walking through. On arrival the communal areas seemed reasonable and the lady who checked me in was friendly despite having atrocious levels of English and struggling to understand anything I say (which amounted to my name, address, yes and no). However, once I stepped in the lift I realised that the lobby is a lightly polished charade. Battered and stinking of cigarette smoke despite the shiny \"no-smoking\" sign on the wall its last clean must pre-date the smoking ban. I arrived at my room to find it was tiny, cold, smelly and incredibly tatty and dirty. The carpet stained, the furniture cheap and battered, the bed small and the TV not working. I needed an iron so looked around and couldn't find one in the room. I read the guest services book in the room, the yellowed food-stained, pages told me there was an iron and ironing board in my room. Needless to say there wasn't. I called reception, it was engaged, I called room service and they put me through to reception and I asked for said iron and ironing board. This was at 9pm, my intention was to iron my shirt and then go to sleep. They said they would send one up. At 10pm I called back and was told it would be on its way. I eventually gave up and went to sleep at 11pm - 2hrs later than I had anticipated and still with creased clothes. In the morning I woke up tired, freezing and itchy to the sound of at least a dozen pigeons right outside my window - there were some flapping in the air as they couldn't find room to land amongst all their friend! I called reception once again, this time it took 15mins for them to answer - I asked for an iron for a third time. This time it arrived 15 mins later, I answered the door in my towel and the woman gave me a look as if to say - why are you answering the door undressed!? (I can't iron my shirt!!). The iron was next to useless and the ironing board was broken. It collapsed to its lowest setting and I resolved to ironing on my knees then going to work in a half creased shirt. In the bathroom I found the remains of someone's poo smeared in the bowl and the shower curtain had splodges of blood stained on it. I didn't have time to complain about any of this (for all the good it would do and the responsiveness of the iron request) and headed off to work. That night I stayed in the office until 11pm to avoid the hotel room for as long as possible. The food was out of my price range and given the levels of cleanliness and hygiene on display in other areas of the hotel I wouldn't have eaten it for free. My usual hotel costs \u00c2\u00a320 more than this but has free wifi. I had to pay \u00c2\u00a320 for wifi here so that cancelled that out. How \u00c2\u00a320 for 48hr wifi is justifiable in a major capital city in 2011 is beyond me. You'll notice the manager answers reviews on tripadvisor (and fair play for doing so) but they always, always follow the same formula. Pick up something positive the reviewer said and spin it to sound like a compliment. On that basis you can fully expect mine to say \"I'm glad you liked the reception area and found our staff friendly, you rightly point out that we do have irons and wifi available in the hotel and local wildlife outside your window.\" The manager never refers to the state of the rooms. It's absolutely disgusting. I've stayed, with no word of a lie, in youth hostels in East Europe with fair better states of repair. Yet they have the nerve to charge people such significant sums of money. The crux of how bad this hotel is is how poorly maintained it is. In an ideal world the management would have a choice, cut their prices to youth hostel standard or refurbish the whole builiding. The reality is that they are raking in cash for such an awful, awful product they hardly care and no matter how many reviews on tripadvisor you try to answer, if you don't care they may as well give up.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Andover, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDoes the job but avoid the concierge service\u201d", "Author": "Burdocks", "ReviewID": "UR121517269", "Content": "My company placed me here for one night as it was the closest hotel to my business dinner location.

That was resolved fairly quickly. We were looking forward to a lovely three course meal on the first night, what we got was poor to say the least. Each paying guest in the dining room on friday night had cause for complaint, one group of about 12 ladies all ordered starters and one of the group received her's when everyone else had finished, the excuse was they were waiting for it to be done (how long does it take to prepare prawn cocktail??) the lack of service, poor food and general malaise of the staff throughout the hotel was apparent. The restaurant staff were running around like headless chickens but getting nowhere!!The soup we ordered was cold on arrival, it came with one slice of bread, no butter/spread we waited twenty minutes for it to be returned....the main course was ok so far as it went..we then ordered dessert and at 9.15 they had run out of one of the two hot desserts entirely. Guests were refusing to pay for their food and walking out, another couple had to wait an hour for pate and toast, if i had not pre paid on the package deal i too would have refused to pay. Breakfast was even more chaotic...queueing for a table i suppose is to be expected... the greeter then went off to reset tables that had been used when there were more than enough staff to do this but they seemed unsure what they should be doing.... leaving the guests to wait even longer. The breakfast was acceptable but the wait for food to be replenished was annoying. The crockery was being piled high on the window sills and no-one seemed prepared to move it.

I specifically requested rooms in the main building as the TripAdvisor reviews of the annexe were so bad, so thanks to my fellow reviewers for the tip. First impressions of the hotel were good with a smart reception and friendly staff. We got a really good rate, which made it excellent value for money. We stayed on what I am told is the busiest weekend of the year for hen parties, and the hotel actually had 15 hen groups staying that night! The reception staff were great and handled our check-in effeciently, even though a number of large groups all arrived at once, and they kindly made an effort to get us into our rooms as early as possible. We had a twin room on the 6th floor. It was a little dated and shabby, but spacious and very well equipped. There was a tea tray with biscuits, a good hairdryer, a safe and an iron and ironing board, spare towels and extra pillows in the wardrobe. The only downside was that it was too hot, with no air-con or fan, and a window that would only open part way. However, as we were on a high floor we could leave the windows open while we were out, so it was cooler when we got back later that evening. The beds were quite firm and very comfortable, with clean bedlinen and unusually thick foam pillows, which turned out to be very comfy to sleep on. In the morning we were shocked to find the biggest breakfast queue I have ever seen! The hotel was obviously very full, with many large groups arriving towards the later end of the breakfast period. Although the restaurant is quite big, it is just not sufficient to cater for the number of guests the hotel can take at maximum capacity. Having said that, the staff were lovely, apologising profusely for the wait and keeping the queue moving as quickly as possible. Once in the restaurant there was another long queue for the breakfast buffet, but the kitchen staff coped impressively with the numbers as all the food trays were piled up high as soon as stocks became low. The cooked breakfast was excellent. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the spa as I had been told it was fully booked for treatments, but I had a brief look at the facilities. There is a small but well equipped gym, quite a small pool with a Jacuzzi and a sauna and steam room. If the hotel was busy it would soon become overcrowded, but I assume it is nice midweek. To sum up, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say that this hotel is a great option for a City based weekend, particularly if you are familiar with this part of town. Guests should be aware that it does cater for large hen/stag/party groups, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come across any excess noise or hassle.

I have also had some bad experiences with Thistle hotels in London in the past (see for example a review of a truly awful experience at the Thistle Euston which you'll find included in my reviews on here) so that didn't inspire me with confidence. Actually, The Thistle Barbican wasn't too bad. It's not the best hotel in London but in my view it's a long way from being the worst. There were no signs of flaxing plaster, dirty linen etc as some people have described. The furniture in the rooms is not modern but, as somebody else has pointed out, you'd pay more for that in some places and they'd call it Edwardian!! The room was spacious enough by London standards and there was a flat screen TV, a safe etc. The bed was a bit hard for my liking as were the pillows but I did sleep OK - I think that was largely due to the fact that there was no traffic noise and that is always a bonus for me. My bathroom was clean and the shower was very good. I didn't try the pool complex as I did not have time but I wish I had had the opportunity. I didn't eat dinner in the hotel - a colleague did and she was unimpressed. I went to a local pub with another colleague and we shared a bottle of wine for a total of \u00c2\u00a317.50 - the bar prices in the hotel are astronomical but that is typical of London hotels I am afraid. Breakfast was average to good - a bit of an issue with the toaster and a bit of a wait for coffee but no serious problems. Check in and check out were both fairly efficient and staff were pleasant. One of the two lifts was not working when we arrived but that was fixed pretty quickly. I was told that all rooms are non-smoking - somebody had been smoking in mine for sure (fag ends on window sill!!) - this was true of my colleagues' rooms too - but it wasn't a big deal for me; the windows opened fully. Also the air con was very efficient. This hotel is not bang slap in the touristy centre of London and there is not much to do in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. As I said, we headed for the pub but I wouldn't have done that alone. It took me 10 mins max to walk to Barbican tube station. Would I stay here again?

They didn't seem to think that it was their problem at all. Also, if you want internet, you have to pay a separate fee. 3) The staff are slow and clueless.

Yes some of the furniture is a little outdated but I find this to be fairly common in London. In Mayfair, they call this Edwardian and charge you \u00c2\u00a3400 a night for the privileged! I admit the staff in the bar and restaurant were a little dithery but I found them very pleasant and attentive. Albeit not directly affected, I was witness to the language barrier that some people have mentioned, but it didn't seem to bother anyone too much. On the other hand the restaurant manageress did a fantastic job explaining the menu to a Chinese couple who didn't speak much English, so it works both ways! All in all, a nice enough hotel to stay in and if it wasn't so far from my office then I would certainly consider it for my next trip. I will definitely keep it in mind however for when bigger events are happening in London and other hotels raise their prices because the Thistle Barbican did not appear to do this for Wimbledon.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth", "Title": "\u201cEat in the chicken diner next door!\u201d", "Author": "Charlene01", "ReviewID": "UR114799349", "Content": "Upon arriving at the Thistle City Barbican we found that the outside of the hotel looked very shabby but we we're relieved as we got closer to the entrance and realised that the main front of the hotel looked alot nicer. We arrived early so were not able to check in, but left our bags with the pleasant concierge so that we could relax in the hotel spa and attend our pre booked treatment appointments. When entering the spa reception we were informed that there were not enough padlocks for thier lockers, as they only had one padlock left we would have to share a locker - Therefore 9 of us had to squeeze our handbags into one locker. The changing rooms, pool and spa area were all clean. When we asked for extra clean towels there was no fuss. We were dissapointed when the final person in our group awaiting a spa treatment had been forgotten about, meaning that we had to wait for a further hour after our appointment time as the treatment team had already started other apponitments. We were not kept informed and I persume that this was all a result of a lack of communication within thier team. We then checked in at around 3.30pm with no fuss. We had booked 4 bedrooms and they were all allocated very close to each other. The rooms are clean, however very tired and worn. There was no air conditioning, just a fan. The beds are very small with extra hard pillows, not the most comfortable beds to sleep in. As there was a large group of us, we had emailed the hotel prior to our arrival with a pre order for the restaurant, this is where the problems began... We sat down to be told that all 9 of us would have to eat the same, tomato soup starter, chicken main and torte for dessert. We advised who I persumed was the restaurant supervisor that we had pre ordered our menu. The gentleman said that the hotel had not recieved the pre order and chef had already prepared the food. Therefore we asked to speak to the duty manager to took at least 10 minutes to show his face. He asked us to provide proof that we had emailed the order, which we said we would get, he then said that he would go and speak to the chef to see what they could do. WE NEVER SAW THIS MANAGER AGAIN! After another 15 minutes had passed, we noticed that the table next to us were complaining, as there was also a large group of them, we thought we would ask what was wrong. They had also been told that they all had to have the same food with no choice, however after complaining they had been told that they could order whatever they wished from the room serive menu. At this point we still hadnt had anyone come back to us with an answer or compromise. So again we went and spoke to the restuarant supervisor, at this point a very pleasant gentleman who introduced himself as the front office manager couldnt help but over hear our complaint so offered to help us. 45 minutes after we sat down for dinner we were told that we would all have to have soup and that they would also provide a vegeterian option for main course. As it was now nearly 9.30pm we just agreed. We do not understand how a hotel of such capacity could not offer a table of 9 more than a one choice menu. The restaurant was dead. No manager was willing to help us and our pre order was just ignored, even after provding email evidence. If we were 9 people who had just come down to the restaurant for dinner, i'm pretty sure that they wouldnt have dictated to us what we had to eat!!! For all of this inconvienice we were given a glass of wine each. The soup was straight out of a tin and had probably been microwaved, the chicken came with 2 new potatoes and was served cold. The vegetarian choice was spaghetti with tinned tomatoes. After a dissapointing starter and main we were all looking foward to dessert. The restaurant staff bought out everyone a slice of bakewell tart, the tart was straight out of a packet and served with what was meant to be buttercream, but lacked any sugar, so was just butter! Bakewell tart had never been mentioned as a dessert choice so we were all dissapointed, When we asked if there was an alternative, e.g sticky toffee pudding (which was on the main restaurant menu), we were told that there was not enough portions left, then after 10 minutes some sticky toffee pudding appeared for 3 people. Generally the hotel managment need some training on how to deal with complaints. They will be recieving our feedback and we are very much looking foward to seeing what they have to say, i'd also be interested to know what happened to the duty manager that was asked to deal with our complain who we never saw again! I'd strongly reccomend the chicken diner across the road for dinner, cheap, quick service and very pleasant staff, mayber the Thistle could learn something from the chicken Diner!

When I tried to explain to the waiter I would like some desert, he asked if I wanted it before my burger. It took about 10 mins to be served (at the bar) even though there was no cue. Mainly this was due to the entire staff not been able to understand you as they don't speak english. When I saw the bill my burger was \u00c2\u00a316.50!! This was due to a service charge of 20% being added. I pointed out that nowhere on the menu does it state this, and then they refunded me. Dodgy! Breakfast was simply a farce!

I have to say the maintenance man arrived at 5.30 pm and looked exhausted, which brings me onto another subject-Thistle has clearly saved money by compromising on staff numbers and the queues at the check-in desk were huge, because this was Easter week. Food at the hotel-breakfast was actually pretty good. Dinner-don't. Surroundings pleasant but gross overpricing for average food. Try Fish Central round the corner. Much better food and a lot cheaper! I am still in this hotel but will be glad to check out tomorrow. Charging high rates for a room can only be justified if there are pleasant staffing and adequate staff who don't look constantly rushed off their feet. The restaurant charges were not justified by the quality of the food.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunfermline", "Title": "\u201cI wouldn't stay here again if you paid me!\u201d", "Author": "Hatchback", "ReviewID": "UR104491579", "Content": "The room decor looks like something from the late 70's/ Early 80's and the bathrooms look like they have never been cleaned.

When I arrived at the hotel you check in on the nice side but I didn't get to stay on that side. I was sent across the driveway to the (dark and cheap side) other building. When you enter the lobby of the 2nd building it's just basically an empty lobby with dirty floors. The size of the rooms are VERY small, but I was by myself so I can live with that fact. This hotel has a LOT of kids (teenagers) staying in it at any given time. Upon closer examination of the room, there was hair on the bathroom floor and on the bed. I tried calling the front desk but no one answered the phone. So I walked down to the front desk to request that room be recleaned and no one showed up that day. I went down to the front desk again in the morning explaining about the hair and requested that the room be cleaned properly and left for the day. When I got back to my room that evening the trash had been emptied and my bed made but the offending hair in the bathroom floor was still there. I tried calling the front desk again and got no answer. This is a common practice for them as I tried calling the front desk more than once to get a wake up call and no one answers the phone. So again I have to walk back downstairs to head to the front desk to ask that my room be cleaned. When I went back to my room to change clothes and head out again my foot went under the bed and touched something...GROSS! I get on my hands and knees to see what it was and it was a chunk of food just hanging out! Mind you the bed only sits maybe 1 - 2 inches off the floor so there is no way for the vaccume to reach underneith. This was more proof that I needed to know that the rooms were NOT being cleaned. It's just nasty! I got tired of asking them to clean my room and just kept my sock and shoes on after that. I don't know if it's standard practice in the UK for hotels to NOT have washclothes but the Thistle City Barbican has none. So if you stay here be prepared to bring your own washclothes and soap because the soap they provide smells like dirty feet!

I was given a room in the block over the way that turned out to be a shoebox facing onto the road junction. It was red hot in the room as the radiator was on full blast.

Cheap, uncomfortable with the hardest pillow Ive had in a while. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the tv picture was fuzzy. Thankfully the shower worked ok although with two separate taps instead of a proper mixer it wasnt easy to get an ambient temperature. Big queues at breakfast with no queue management - have to admit the breakfast chice was fairly good although they have way too many tables squeezed into the restaurant. 20 people queuing to check out so asked for an envelope for speedy check-out. There was a box on the wall with a big sign saying \"pop your speedy check-out envelope in herre if you need to check out quickly\".

It's not in the best of areas but I didn't feel uncomfortable on the walk, was just very conscious of walking around dimly lit streets with a trolley bag and a laptop over my shoulder. After trouble checking in (my company specified that everything would be invoiced but the hotel wanted a credit card, unsure if this is the hotels fault or the booking company), i was assigned a twin room in the main building on the 4th floor. I battled with the key-card, opened the door, heard the noise of the wind coming through the gaps in the wooden window frames, closed the door and went to request a different room. The staff were un-surprised and unapologetic, I was then given a single room with an internally facing window. The room was dated but clean. Trip 2: Although I voiced my disapproval after my first visit, the company booked me back in the hotel again. This time my colleague and I had a single room each in the annex building, the corridors looked recently refurnished, the rooms were not. The single room was TINY, its clear that the reason they were single was because you couldnt physically fit a double bed in there (no exageration), there was a single bed, a bedside table and that filled the width of the room, the TV, although nice to have a flatscreen, was on a hinge so you could fold it out when watching it and fold it back to walk past. The room had an inward facing window again and paper thin walls. I called my colleague through the wall in the morning to make sure he was up and it actually woke him. Trip 3: This time i arrived with only negative expectations after previous visits. I am pleased to say that the girl on reception remembered me from my last visit, im usually sceptical when hotel staff welcome me back as they can usually see ive visited before from the computer but she said welcome back before I gave her my name on checkin. I was given a twin room with 2 single, this was in the main building and the room was a very good size, again with an inward facing window but with a room that size i didnt mind. As with the rest of the room, it was dated but clean. I had to laugh at the bathroom, they had obviously refitted it in recent years and fitted a larger basin than was there before as I had to lean sideways as i was pooping because the basin was in the way. The rest.... There are 3 main choices for food and drinks: 1) the bar and restaurant opposite reception, poor food every time although they were quick to offer free drinks when my colleague complained, I wouldve preferred a decent meal though. 2) the bar by the lifts, much better service, polite staff and a decent burger (i assume it comes from the same kitchen as the rest of the food though). Nice decor and a big TV. 3) The chicken place on the corner outside the hotel, typical chicken place, like the place you buy your kebab from on a saturday night in town, still better than what the hotel had to offer.

The carpet was threadbare, and the chair was worn through to the cushion underneath. There was noise all night from pipes. The ceiliong fan was not working - the switch was sheered off. The bed was a foot from the wall and had no fixed bed head. There was a puddle from the radiator when you turned it off. If you left it on it was very stuffy - these are small rooms. If you opened the window a crack - all that you could - you needed top open the heavy curtains also to let any ait in - office blocks opposite left lights on all night. So nothing very terrible for a 3 star London hotel but one night of scruff and dust was enough.

It was a \"mystery hotel\" and i thought it was a good deal at \u00c2\u00a399 until i found out the hotel name and checked the feedback on tripadvisor. I was nervous about my booking so i phoned the hotel and made a couple of requests. First, that my partner is very tall so could they ensure that we didn't get one of the low-roofed bedrooms that some people have referred to; second, that we got a double bed rather than a twin; and third, that it was a quiet room because i'm a light sleeper. i was told this was no problem. We arrived at the hotel and i was a bit concerned about the location. The front of the hotel itself is quite nice but i can understand why some people are a bit miffed at (what appeared to be) the dodgy area of town. The receptionist had no record of my call a few days previous and was going to give me a twin room. I told her about my phone call and also that it was our anniversary that weekend. She then upgraded us to a premium room at no extra cost, and sent up a bottle of wine. An unexpected gesture which certainly made up for my requests having been lost. We got to the room and it was a good size. The decor is rather dated although the bathroom had had some work done recently so it looked a bit sharper than the rest of the room. The room was split into two parts - a living room and a bedroom. The room was quiet, warm and comfortable enough. We went into the leisure facilities which was a small trek from the room (a bit of a maze!) and it was fine. The steam room was cracking although they'll need to look at where the steam comes from - it could burn when the steam comes out! The shower area in the changing rooms wasn't great and could do with a complete upgrade. We ate in the bar area - the barman was very helpful on advising about how fresh the food was etc. The food was very average. Perhaps we should have tried the restaurant! We didn't have breakfast because we were heading off early the next morning. Overall, a reasonable stay. For \u00c2\u00a399 in London it was fine.

Pleasant surroundings and reasonable selection of equipment for a hotel gym. Spa and pool are looked lovely although one comment from another of the party (I didnt try) was that the jacuzzi was gritty. Gourmet meal was very good and full of flavour. The choc torte was fierce some! Service of the food was excellent too but they wer very slow to take drinks order and deliver. Also the waiter had a BO problem. Not good given his occupation and was leaning in close to deliver food and drink. Also they wanted payment for the drinks immediately rather than at the end of the meal. I think they are missing a trick. People will drink more if its on a tab Top tip \u00e2\u20ac\u201c book some music for the room and plan to decorate. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a meeting room which looks very bland and business like, not what you want for a party. Hamed the catering manager allowed us to decorate the table and room which was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c thank you, Hamed.

Most of this I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind so much given the price of the package. Street noise was intrusive and walls were paper thin. Ok if you know your room neighbours and can sleep anywhere but would have been very annoying otherwise. Saturday breakfast was fine other than a huge queue for the hot food. All buffet style. Sunday was dreadful. There was a massive queue just to get seated. We were a large group (12) and so were put into a separate room which was a meeting room adapted for breakfast over flow. Unfortunately they had not set the room up adequately or allocated sufficient staff . The tables were not set, no napkins, cutlery, cups or glasses. No hot water for tea. No juice. Bins overflowing. Tables were not cleared for the hour we were in this room. Left over food (there was a lot) plates etc., sat there. Disgusting. The food was cold, probably because it sat undeneath the air con unit, also not very hygienic. We complained to Hamed who apologised (altough initally tried to argue - mistake) and offered teas, coffees and more breakfast if required. Overall probably just about value for money but not somewhere I would plan on going back to unless money was tight and I had to stay in that area.

Yes, we had to stay in the annex and not the main part of the hotel. However, they have remodeled, and the annex (other than the one elevator that didn't always work, though the other did), was very clean and smoke-free. Our room, though quite small, had all the amenities we knew we were to receive, and everything worked (though the shower was a bit difficult to turn on at first). Yes, the rooms are small, but we didn't plan to spend much time in the rooms. Also, as with most UK hotels, internet was not free, but you could buy a multi-day voucher online, and we used that to share photos with our family about our vacation. The English breakfast was probably the best part of our stay. Yes, there was a line if you arrived between 8:30 and 9:00, but it moved quickly. All the food was warm and freshly prepared. The juice machine worked, and since we had our meal included, there were no problems. There was also no voucher required for the meals, we just had to give our room number. The hotel bar/restaurant, however, was extremely overpriced, but because we got to the hotel early (we had been told that we would get to check in a few hours early), we were forced to eat there. Hotels have a 12.5% surcharge on food, so just walk down the street to get something to eat. They did promise to let us check-in early, and they did not do so. They seem to have many late check-outs, so don't arrive early and expect to do anything but hang out in the lounge. The hotel is not close to any Metro stops, so we got a lot of walking in (warning that Old Street Station has some steep steps, and suitcases have to be carried). However, the day concierge was wonderful and helped us navigate the tube systems. The evening and weekend concierge was far less helpful, and was somewhat grumpy. The one thing we had a major issue with was that the maid did NOT understand the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign, and came barging in after we had just taken a shower.

Reception was in some disarray fighting with a printer problem. Rooms are in two buildings opposite each other across a vehicle entrance. London in the summer means lack of air con can make for a hot and stuffy room. This was not the case here as the window opened OK, but did not close properly. The room and bathroon was showing its age. As the room was on the main street and there was constrution work, I'm glad I took earplugs. The room was very small and a single upright chair and small desk was barely adequate for working on my laptop all evening (\u00c2\u00a39.99 for 24 hr BT OpenZone connection). I suspect this was a single room business deal and tourists should get better. The main gripe was poor service in the bar in the evening, the snack and drink took ages to come and I needed to chase. The sandwiches were dry and uninspiring when they came. Having looked forward to breakfast I found the selection poor and the hot food luke warm. Please note, Britsh traditional fried breakfast is not pleasant if not hot. The toaster took 3 goes to make acceptable medium colour. I had to seek out staff to ask for a coffee refil.

My room had old, tatty wallpaper and lots (and lots) of stains on the walls. and carpet. The room was tiny - the smallest and dirtiest I have ever been in in 14 years of travelling on business, including many trips to Lithuania, Belarus, Latvia and Estonia. Everything is the room was dirty and a lot of things were sticky. The TV remote was covered in clumps of sticky brown goo (God alone knows what is was). The room was very dark and there wasn't mch natural light so no way of improving matters. There was a distinct smell of urine in the room - it didn't come from the bed so I simply slept on top of the bed (the sheets were heavily stained so didn't want to sleep in them). There was no aircon and the room was roasting with no way of changing the temperature. The bed itself was stained and I'm not 100% sure if it was actually made since the last people were there. I was a guy travelling on his own and was shattered after a very early start so just crashed out. However, if I had my children in this place I would have left immediately as I would have been concerned that they would catch something (that is not a joke). There was a damp stain and mould in the tiny bathroom. Also, the sealant was coming away from the bath which made it look even sleazier. The toilet was cracked which made you worried that if you used it, it would flood the bathroom. My (solitary) towel was ripped, but trust me that was the least of my problems;-) The door to my room didn't swing shut, you had to give it a hard shove. If I hadn't realised this I would have lunwittingly eft my room with the door unlocked. Also, you could see at the lock that the door had been forced open sometime before (I wonder why??) There was pipework in my room and fixes that resembled bad DIY projects. There is no way this is a 2 star hotel far less a 4 star hotel. There was no mini bar in my room and not enough plugs (which is what you'd expect from 4star places). Any Travel Lodge I have been in is a million times better than this place. I did smile at my iron cupboard. It had no ironing board....or an iron. Just the broken fittings for them in an empty cupboard. The location is not good. It is in the middle of a council estate and there were several groups of youth hanging around drinking when I went out (7.00pm). There were shouts and screams till about 3.00am (nothing dramatic - just drunken teenagers doing their things but it does keep you awake). It is not near a tube station. It is not near any nice bars, cafes, etc. Check in took 15 minutes with a grand total of 3 people in front of me. HOWEVER..... the reception area looks pretty smart and clean (so if you're a big fan of tidy receptions ......;-)). AND.....the gym is clean, although small and got overcrowded quickly, Overall, this is a disgusting, horrible hotel.

As you can imagine I was very nervous and panicking about it being horrible after reading the horror stories. However I was pleasently surprised when we arrived at the hotel. It was a short walk from Barbican tube (approx 7-8 mins at a medium pace with suitcases) so not central but by no means out in the sticks. We got a cab to Tottenham Court Road and it was only \u00c2\u00a312. As for the comments about being a rough and unsafe area to walk through, blimey if you think this is a bad area then you don't know London very well, it could be a lot worse! We walked back from the bus stop on Goswell road at 2am and didnt feel vunerable at all. The reception and concierge staff were efficient and helpful. Only complaint was is was v hot in reception and it wasn't even a sunny day! We had 5 rooms in total, and all of the were perfectly acceptable. All clean and well kept. Only one room had a problem and that was a dodgy bathroom light. This however was soon rectified by the hotel. Rooms had good facilities which freeview tv and tea/coffee making facilities. Beds were comfy and space in the room was fine, even in the triple room with a z bed. The breakfast was of a reasonable standard, in a buffet style. Some of the hot food was a little cold but there was staff constantly replenishing. They accomadated our large group quickly and easily which was nice to have brekkie all together. The pool area definitely deserves a mention as well as it was so good. The pool was quite and clean. We also used sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. Good sized changing rooms.

I will start my review by focusing on the good points as it would be unfair to be solely disparaging. The gym exists and the guys who run it are very friendly. Ok, now the bad. The gym equipment is very well used and if you're hoping to use the pool/sauna, get there early as there aren't enough padlocks (you need to ask for them at reception) to fit all the lockers. Surely some of my \u00c2\u00a3175 a night could buy a couple dozen more from the local hardware store? I have been staying here for 5 weeks now on business (not by choice) and I have stayed on most floors. The rooms are along the lines of a Travelodge but less spacious and the fixtures especially in the bathrooms are bordering on broken. Sometimes you will get a radiator with no temperature control so take plenty of water to slake your 3am searing thirst. I can't deny the rooms are clean, I know they get cleaned because I had a cleaner's sponge left next to my toothbrush last week. The sponge wasn't even new. Ok, so how about the food? well, breakfast is available and you must be seated by one of the ever changing members of staff. The food (for the added cost of \u00c2\u00a310 + VAT) includes bread that tastes like something from the value range of a leading budget supermarket, concentrated orange juice out of a machine, a handful of cereals oh and the coffee is the strongest coffee in the world. I added a quarter cup of milk and it had no effect on the colour. I like coffee strong but it was undrinkable. There is hot 'full English' food available but I've not had the urge to try it and probably won't. The thing that really pushed me to write this review is the bar. Ok, so you're in a hotel not far from central London, you expect to pay a premium. I tried the burger tonight, it was nothing special although I paid \u00c2\u00a313.44 for the privelige (that includes the mandatory 12.5% surcharge). I washed it down with a nice pint of orange & lemonade, that cost \u00c2\u00a39.33. Yes, I too thought there was a mistake there, \u00c2\u00a39.33 for a soft drink (no sparklers or umbrellas even) and so I did question that charge with the barman only to get the reply \"that's hotel prices Sir\". Needless to say I was greatful for the barman kindly enlightening me as I didn't realise I was staying in a hotel.

The breakfast was a let down though, poor quality and a very limited choice (hardly any fresh fruit). It is also irritating to have to queue so long for a table. The hotel really needs to sort out the breakfast room and try and provide enough space for the number of people usually staying there, as well as improving the quality of food provided.

We called downstairs for an ice bucket and for somebody to unlock our fridge and staff arrived within minutes to fulfill both of our requests. The main reason I chose the hotel was because it was the only mid-priced accomodation with leisure facilities. We visited the pool, sauna and steam room to relax before getting ready to go to the theatre and were both more than happy with the staff and facilites, even down to the gym which we were unfortunately unabel to use due to lack of time but appeared to be well kitted out. We did not have to wait to be seated for breakfast the next morning and the offerings were generally above average, and although there was a lack of fresh fruit we were met by cereals, yogurts, bakery items and a full spread of cooked foods, which you could help yourself to as much as you liked.

There was an iron & trouser press in the room, however the ironing board was built into the trouser press unit. This was located right next to the door which made it awkward to use. The room was tired at the corners and could do with a refresh. The fridge definitely needed to be replaced, it seemed to impart a flavour on anything kept in it for a day or so.

Walls are paper thin and i could hear coversations from rooms on all sides. This, combined with various noises of fighting etc from outside, made sleeping impossible; 4. The desk in the room was torn and splintered to add to the fact that there was no free internet; made it difficult to work; 5. I requested an iron no less than 3 times before someone finally came back to me to say that none were available until the morning, making it very difficult for me to have a shirt ready for an early meeting; 6.

I travelled with seven friends, and between us we had reserved a triple and two double rooms. On arrival at the hotel we were quickly checked in ... initially we were a little disappointed not to have had our rooms close together (our own fault I guess, having not anticipated and pre arranged this.) However, we decided it wouldn't be a problem as we could easily meet up in the foyer later. Although, as with many London hotels the exterior of the hotel was'nt particularly grand, you shouldn't be deceived as the foyer, bars, restaurants and corridors were spacious and plush. When we entered our room (the triple) all three of us were delighted with it. We were surprised to find that we had been given the 'premier executive suite', and assumed that we had just landed lucky to be given such a well presented room. It was exactly as on the websites photos - brightly and attractively decorated in yellows and reds, with a double bed and sofa bed. It was the little added extras that made it all the more special - colour coordinated cushions, plants, dressing gown, toiletries etc. We really couldn't believe that we had come to the same place as described on this site, yet felt a little guilty thinking our friends would probably not be in rooms of the same standard... a guilt that didn't last long, however, as they both informed me that their rooms were \"beautiful\". I forgot to say that mine and one of the other rooms were in the main building and the other one was in the adjoining building - a few steps across the covered entrance area. We decided to eat out at Covent garden in the evening, and asked the staff if they could help us out with arranging a taxi. This was done within minutes, and the hotel helped arrange a fixed price with the drivers (which for the seven of us worked out about \u00c2\u00a37 each for two cabs including return journey - probably cheaper than the tube and far less stressful.) On return to the hotel a few hours later, we enjoyed a quiet drink in the hotel bar. Breakfast was (I think) from seven to eleven - plenty of choice - cereals, fruit, full English etc - I couldn't fault it. Perhaps this hotel isn't as central as we would have liked, but it really wasn't a problem. We didn't really plan to stay around the hotel area anyhow - just to use it as a base. I can honestly say we are all pretty surprised and curious as to why there are so many negative reviews on here - and it's certainly taught me not to believe all I read! I should also mention a fantastic place to eat for anyone eating out and wanting to visit Covent garden - Sofra (Covent Garden) 36 Tavistock Street, London, WC2E 7PB The food was absolutely gorgeous - top quality food (with a Turkish/Greek slant), provided in lovely surroundings - we sat up in the covered roof terrace - we had a beautiful main meal, glass of wine and sweet for about \u00c2\u00a320 per head - I have no idea how they manage to do it for this price as they could be charging so much more.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent", "Title": "\u201cFAR, FAR BETTER THAN THESE REVIEWS SUGGEST!!\u201d", "Author": "petalskent", "ReviewID": "UR32813037", "Content": "Have just returned from two night stay at this hotel and feel compelled to write, as this hotel is in my opinion completely mis-represented by these reviews.

As such I emailed the hotel a week before the stay and told the staff that I'd read some bad reviews (and that I hoped my experience would not reflect such reviews). I was offered a room upgrade for \u00c2\u00a320 for the two nights (\u00c2\u00a310 per night) which I took. The hotel itself is indeed an ugly building, looking dirty and tired from the outside. The main entrance is a little hidden away, and every time we walked in or out of the hotel we had to fight our way past a group of smokers. The main foyer and reception areas are modern and clean, and the staff very helpful (we found this to be the case throughout the stay). Our room was large and well-appointed. It had obviously had a recent refurbishment, and had good air conditioning and a decent 32\" LCD television with alarm clock function. The view from the window was nothing special (more later) and the windows could have done with a clean, but they weren't too bad. Our bathroom was small and perhaps a little dated (it reminded me of a Turkish hotel bathroom) but was clean, functional and, again, well appointed. We had breakfast in the hotel both days and this was nice enough, although the bacon could have done with being a little more fresh. I enjoyed being offered a selection of morning papers to read whilst having breakfast - something I hadn't experienced in an English hotel before. Negatives? Well, the hotel is a little off the beaten track. It's about twenty minutes walk from the closest tube station, which we didn't mind. The area around the hotel is not the best, and could be a little intimidating in hours of darkness. A younger couple (we're in our twenties) will probably cope fine with the location, but I'd perhaps advise older guests to use taxis to get to and from the hotel. The very first time we left the hotel (for a wander) we were follwed around by a gang of young men in baseball hats - it was probably very innocent and all that, but we did feel a little uncomfortable. And as we were settling into our room I looked out of the window to grab my bearings, and witnessed a stop-and-search arrest taking place on the street below...again, not a hugely comforting sight. But not the end of the world either (it's a city after all). Another little gripe - on arriving at the hotel, we were asked to sign a form that set out how much we had agreed to pay. Most of the stay had been prepaid, but the upgrade portion needed signing for...and the form informed quoted a higher price than we had been offered. The receptionist refused to believe the price we had been offered for upgrade, until I produced a printout of the emails I had exchanged with the hotel. It's quite bad that I needed to prove the offer, and anyone who hadn't printed out such details might have been 'ripped off'. This is the only truly negative thing I can say about the experience though, and the staff were 100% helpful during the rest of the stay. The hotel seemed to be frequented mostly by business people and particularly a number of people involved in the medical profession, students included. This meant the reception and communal areas were quiet and there were no rowdy tourists. Overall I found our stay to be comfortable and pleasant, and I would have no quarms in using it again.

However the staff are friendly, the rooms are clean and the overall experience was good. We had two rooms with adjoining door and it was more than ample for our needs. The furniture is a bit faded and could do with some attention, and some of the decor in the hallway was peeling, but these are not enough of a problem to give it a poor overall review.

The few staff on duty were run off their feet and therefore unable (or unwilling) to break into a smile when greeted. Monday to Friday you will get a table no problem.

You don't know how many people are being paid to write positive reviews or how many are being paid by the competition to write negative reviews. The more competitive the industry, the more likely it is that some of this is going on - and accommodation in London is, I imagine, about as competitive as it gets. Despite the amount of superlatives and exclamation marks I'm going to include in this review I have no affiliation with Thistle or Lastminute or anyone else - but I am a genuinely happy customer and last weekend I really DID have the best hotel experience in London I have ever enjoyed! Like some other reviewers here, I booked through Top Secret Hotels on lastminute.com (\"Price Madness at hotel with Pool near Square Mile - 4* - London \") and ended up paying \u00c2\u00a384 for what might have set me back \u00c2\u00a3199 (according to the room price list in reception). After booking I came here to read the reviews and was dismayed to see so many negative comments and complaints. Luckily, the experience enjoyed by my girlfriend and myself is something I imagine we will always remember with a great deal of happiness. The hotel staff were brilliant throughout. Despite check-in opening officially at 2pm, the staff allowed us to check in at 1.20pm on the Saturday afternoon. When we asked for a late checkout on the Sunday morning, the staff assented without hesitation. At no point did the staff urge us to pay for a room upgrade as some other reviewers appear to have experienced. (This may have been because the hotel occupancy was lower during the weekend we stayed, so we automatically got one of the better rooms?) The room was certainly spacious enough - the same size as one would expect from a Travelodge or Premier Inn. All facilities were available - a clean bathroom, digital television, tea and coffee making facilities etc. There was no queue for breakfast on the Sunday morning and certainly not one stretching through reception (?) Breakfast was all the better when, after sitting down, I noticed the price in the menu with some shock (\u00c2\u00a315.95 per person!) . I enquired about this price and gave our room number and without blinking the duty manager waived the breakfast fees for both of us. (Our tariff was originally \"Room only\"). The hotel was an easy walk from Old Street tube station, from where we took the tube on the Saturday lunchtime to London Bridge and spent a lovely afternoon wandering through Borough Market and along the South Bank to the Tate Modern, the Millenium Bridge and St. Pauls Cathedral. In the evening, we joined friends for a fantastic curry and drinks in Brick Lane which was just a 25 minute walk away - we didn't have to take a bus or a tube. The highlight of the hotel stay was the free spa! We took advantage of the swimming pool, sauna and jacuzzi on both the Saturday afternoon before going out for the evening AND on the Sunday morning after breakfast. The hotel location which, admittedly, is slightly unusual was not a problem for me. I am already familiar with London and already knew how to navigate on foot from the hotel to both Angel / Islington (ten minutes walk in one direction) and Hoxton / Shoreditch (six minutes walk in the other) otherwise the area might have seemed a little quiet. I noted that breakfast hours are extended on Sunday and few people are in the rush they might be on a weekday (so perhaps that explains the lack of breakfast queue). Additionally, we felt that we'd had quite the bargain, booking at a discounted rate and then receiving complimentary breakfast on top. If we'd paid full fare for everything, it wouldn't have seemed nearly so much of a bargain. My advice: it's probably better to stay at this hotel on the weekend than during the week - if you are attending some mid-week event at the Barbican for example, you might be better off staying somewhere else. If you're less familar with London, you'll enjoy your stay more if you can familiarise yourself with a map of the area first (see streetmap.co.uk) and see how City Road connects to Islington in one direction (10 mins on foot) and Old Street in the other (6 mins on foot). Also, ideally, you'll want to book through lastminute.com Top Secret Hotels to get a superb discount! All things considered, we thought being able to stay a central London hotel with a swimming pool and spa and complimentary breakfast at the discounted rate was unbeatable!

I booked the weekend package of a standard room to extend a stay in London after visiting friends. The deal was great considering there is a pool (a rarity in London hotels), but, as ever with such things, there was quite a catch! On arriving, I checked in and was asked three times by the receptionist whether I wanted to upgrade at a cost of \"20 quid\", to which I declined, as in decent hotels, it's generally not required. I was directed to the building opposite where all the standard rooms are and couldn't believe how dark, dingy and cheaply finished the building was. My room was miniscule, with cheap, ugly furnishings and a dreadful smell of damp. I returned to reception and asked to upgrade, and was sent to another room, equally small, and just with slightly nicer furniture. At this point, I contacted the Hilton in Islington who offered a deluxe room for just \u00c2\u00a34 more, and we resolved to leave. I informed the reception, who advised me that I would lose what I'd paid for the room because it was after 2pm (by about 15 minutes) and after arguing for ten minutes, they offered to upgrade me to a suite. We checked the room which had a piece of wallpaper torn off, was decorated in orange, yellow, red and green with stripey wallpaper (where it remained), and was about the size of a standard room anywhere else (not a particularly sweet suite). Despite not being happy, I was still not able to cancel the booking, and the cost of my original upgrade was still charged. Add to that the fact that the carpet on the lift walls had been ripped off for someone to tear 'You are gay\" into the foam, and I was not impressed. The pool is the only draw, given that the hotel is in a terrible location (pretty much in the middle of a council estate), there is nowhere close by to eat and the bars of Farringdon are generally closed at the weekend.

However, I needed somewhere cheap that was close to the City, so I settled on the City Barbican hotel despite my previous visit. When I arrived at the hotel, the first thing I noticed was the new Thistle branding - very chic, lowercase and minimal - and this was reflected in a bright, clean public reception and bar area. So I figured it had improved and cheerfully checked in. However, the public area and the room I stayed in on the sixth floor were like distant cousins. My twin room was old-fashioned and cramped. The only concession to modernity was a small flatscreen TV, but beyond this it was chipped furniture, suspicious stains on the curtains and a shower that badly needed a limescale treatment. I stayed awake most of the night as my ears had tuned into an annoying dripping noise from the pipes in the wall behind the headboard. I had breakfast in the room. The earliest slot was 7.00, but the slip advised that an earlier slot could be booked if you rang roomservice, which I did, and the tray arrived, on time, at the 6.30 slot I'd requested. On the menu card, it said 'wholemeal bloomer toast', which rather gives the impression of rustic, rough-cut bread, but it was in fact two slices of floppy square-cut bread straight out of a packet. I tend to measure hotels on the warmth of the toast inthe room service breakfast, and this toast was pleasantly warm, even if aesthetically it was below par. This hotel is quite remote, being ten minutes (at least) from either Old Street or Barbican Underground stations. There is a free shuttle bus that runs to either tube station (and Moorgate) from the hotel every ten minutes, which is good.

The hotel consists of two buildings; the main reception, bars and restaurant are together in one of the buildings. The public areas are actually quite smart and clean, but this didn't reflect the quality of the room. My room was quite small, considering this is a 'City' hotel. The fixtures and fittings were quite worn; the 'safe' had actually come away from the wall so I certainly wasn't going to trust any of my belongings to it! My room had a large, freestanding fan, a sign that the room could get very hot - which it did, making getting a good night's sleep on the first night quite difficult. I accidentally flooded the bathroom the next morning due to a leak behind the bath taps. As you can see in the picture the seals are mouldy. The bathroom is in need of a refit. At breakfast the food and service were below standard. It took ages before I was asked whether I'd like tea or coffee. The bread rolls and croissants seemed stale, beans were starting to congeal and hash browns were hard. There were no spoons on the breakfast table to stir coffee with.

Admittedly we were a large group averaging 20 throughout the two nights we stayed, however the hotel was not in the least bit organised, despite one of our party having contacted them well in advance to advise them and confirm with them the itinerary for the day on Saturday. As part of a hen package organised by a booking agent we had each paid for a mini spa treatment lasting half an hour. The week before we were told that the treatments could not take place in the spa itself but instead we would have to use two of the rooms we had booked. The treatments had not been scheduled properly and the one bit of paper that they were scribbled down on was lost. It was then left to two of our party to talk to each individual and re-schedule the treatments. There was lots of confusion and some girls ended up having their treatments moved several times. Furthermore, not everyone was asked if they suffered from any illnesses or allergies, nor was everyone asked to sign disclaimer forms. For those of us hoping to enjoy the spa facilities the jacuzzi was \"closed for maintenance\" despite no-one maintaining it at all throughout the day. As I said above we were a large party however the staff at the spa did not once apologise and were unconcerned and at times downright rude. One girl went down to use the hairdryer in the spa on the Saturday evening as the hairdryers in the rooms were not particularly powerful and was challenged by a member of the spa staff and accused of not staying at the hotel. When she told him she was staying there and questioned his rudeness he countered that \"it was as much her fault as his\" for not telling him she was staying there and started to shout at her. At breakfast on the Sunday morning there were clearly not enough staff on duty and despite having reserved a table for our party it was not fully set for enough people. When I asked a girl who was clearing tables if she could bring 3 settings to our table she replied \"no, you're sitting in the bar and I'm not working in the bar\" and walked off. All of the above said, when we did complain to the manager she was very apologetic and offered us free sandwiches for lunch. The rooms were comfortable enough and generally the hotel is OK. However if you have paid a lot of money (which we had) and the hotel has been advised in plenty of time of the number of guests etc. then they should have been fully prepared. And even if things go wrong, which we expect from time to time, there is no excuse for rudeness and bad manners.

The hotel was not my first choice however I was allocated to stay here due to other hotels in the area being full. I arrived at the hotel well after midnight and upon checking in the receptionist told me that he'd upgraded my room. I was most pleased and when told my room was on the 6th floor, I took this to be a good sign. Unfortunately when I got out the lift I was appalled at the state of the corridor, the decor was that of a mid '70s council office. However it was late and I was tired so I made my way to my room, the door opened to what was a small stuffy twin room that was extremely basic and barrenly furnished. I dreaded to think what the room was like that I'd been upgraded from. There was no air conditioning in the room (how any so-called 4 star London hotel can not have air conditioning is beyond me). Had it not been so late I would have immediatly requested to be moved. To compensate I ordered some room service - a simple sandwich - 10 minutes after placing my order I got a call to tell me that they had run out of the ingredients for what I had requested so I changed my order to a salmon sandwich. About 20 minutes later a plate was brought to my door on which sat a sandwich that you would be embarrassed to give a dog, artfully dressed with some crisps that looked like they'd seen better days. The following day, after a fitful night's sleep, I walked from the 6th floor to reception and it did appear that some of the other floors looked a bit better decorated so maybe I had drawn the short straw. However, you would think that the hotel would accommodate a solo businesswomen traveller in a comfortable room where one didn't have to double lock the door in order to feel safe.

We booked a weekend break through Superbreaks and flew with Ryanair to Stansted. Our travel arrangements went very well and when we arrived at the hotel about 10am we were advised that our room wasn't ready, but we didn't expect it to be. We left our cases with the Concierge and went for a walk. When we returned about 11.30 we were informed that our room was ready. This was a bonus as we thought we would have to wait until 2pm. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, as was the Concierge. Our room was in the second building and yes, the room was quite small, but clean, as was the bathroom and the fresh towels daily were soft and large. The bed was comfortable with lovely clean cotton white sheets and duvet cover. The free standing fan was good, efficient and kept the room at a pleasant temperature.Our objective was to see as much of London in the time we had, so spending a long time in the room wasn't an option. Breakfasts were very good and there was plenty to choose from....we did eat just after 0800 each morning, and the food was replenished regularly and was hot. We were out of the hotel all day and only returned to shower and change for dinner. We ate in the Fish Central restaurant across the road from the hotel and was a most enjoyable experience...good food, reasonably priced as was the wine and the service efficient and friendly. This place closes on Sunday and we would advise booking a table as it is a popular eating place. It is not pretentious and doesn't have table cloths, but the food is good ! We ate in the hotel on Sunday night and were quite impressed with what we chose. This is rated as a 3 star by Superbreaks and is above average for a 3 star establishment, especially for the price we paid for a London hotel ! We did not use the pool but went to see it and it appeared clean and a reasonable size. The staff here were also very helpful and had we had more time would have used it. The area around the hotel is not quite the ghetto area we were expecting and we walked everywhere during our stay and did not feel threatened at all. We didn't venture away at night, so perhaps in the dark late hours it is a different story, we cannot comment. We were pleasantly surprised with this hotel and would offer the opinion that if you are expecting an inner London 5 star delux hotel, go else where. For what we paid, along with the cleanliness, friendliness and helpfulness of staff, we cannot fault it and would recommend it to those who are not averse to walking. The bar prices are quite high and a service charge is added to the drinks bill, but it is London and drinking in the bar is not compulsory ! We were quite impressed with this hotel, especially after all the adverse comments written by previous guests.

Yes, the corridors are an absolute rabbit-warren, but the room numbers are well signposted so finding your room is never a problem.

But that said, it's actually a good location if you need to be in the City for business. I was a bit doubtful given previous reviews, but for a midweek business stay it was fine. Check-in was efficient and I was soon in the room. The rooms are small and definitely could do with redecoration. The walls have heat marks above the lights and are definitely grubby. There's also very little space to spare. For example, you have to move the chairs to open the wardrobe and you have to sit on the end of the bed to use the desk/dressing table - there's no room for a chair. That said the bed was firm and comfortable and the linen clean and fresh. The hotel is close to the trendy Hoxton area with its interesting bars and restaurants - and there's a late opening Somerfield on Old Street if you need any drinks or snacks. Breakfast was a disappointment. The buffet is pretty basic. The cereal selection was fine - but there was a sad looking display of colds meats and cheese. The hot selection was more luke warm - with rubbery scrambled egg and flabby, fatty bacon. There's no real excuse for it. Plenty of hotels manage to ensure breakfast is good - and things are hot! It strikes me that at the Thistle they take the low cost lazy option. Cook all the hot items for the start of breakfast service, pile it up in dishes on the hot buffet and leave it there to fester and congeal. The orange juice tasted weak and watery and may have been made up from a powder. Half a glass was enough. I'd have been annoyed if the breakfast had been chargeable, but included in the room rate I wasn't too fussed. So if you don't fancy breakfast - give it a miss. You are not missing much. Maybe a room service continental breakfast would be a better option.

The nearest train station is Old Street, which 15 mins away, not good though as you have to change trains and walking to and from the station really does swallow up your time (plus we could do without the worry of getting mugged!)

As for the hotel? Well, it is not cheap - in fact it is an expensive hotel, but then I suppose you are paying for the location (very close to the northern edge of the City and the Barbican Centre is nearby). Good points: The hotel staff are friendly, if perhaps not the best communicators. Bed was extremely comfortable - we both got a great night's sleep. The swimming pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi were excellent if perhaps a little small. Breakfast was very enjoyable and great quality. A nice touch is the courtesy bus that takes guests to local tube stations - again, obviously angled at guests who are there to do business in the City. Bad points: The room is very small, given the cost. Communications were not the best - for example, the tea/coffee making facilities were hidden away in a double-drawer cunningly designed to look like two single drawers. No sign explained this, so unless you hunted/nosed through all the drawers, you had no idea where they were. The TV reception was appalling. There were other little niggles, like the light in the wardrobe that was supposed to switch off when the door was closed... but didn't. Or the price list in the room that made it seem like the pool area was subject to an additional charge (it wasn't, but we had to check). Or the lack of information in the room about when breakfast was available. Or the light fitting that wasn't quite fitting to the wall. Or the lift that didn't stop flush with the floor - we saw a couple of people trip due to this. Given that this is an expensive hotel to stay at, personally I would expect things to be perfect... and they were not. If you are staying on your own as part of a business trip, someone else is footing the bill and you need to be close to the City without actually being right in the middle, then this hotel will satisfy your needs.

Tried breakfast once, it was fair but terribly overpriced (they insisted my company booking at \u00c2\u00a390 per night did not include breakfast) . In the evenings, I walked to Angel tube station to get into Central London to eat. I made sure I was back by 9:00 pm though ! On the plus side, the Hotel do offer a free shuttle service in the mornings to Old Street tube which was very welcome. Overall, I really cannot recommand this Hotel, sorry. Tube Tip : It's been years since I last stayed in Central London and the \u00c2\u00a34 minimum tube fare was eye watering. I purchased an Oyster card on the Sunday evening : \u00c2\u00a323 for 7 days unlimited tube travel areas 1 & 2 : bargain ! Food Tip : Mr Wu's Chinese Buffet (Irving Street, just off Leicester Square) is amazing. All you can eat for \u00c2\u00a34.95. I ate there some years previously so I simply had to try them again. Excellent food for the price, I wonder if there's anywhere else in the UK (never mind London) offering such good value.", "Date": "February 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scarborough, North Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cNot family friendly...but tried hard to please us!\u201d", "Author": "MissNorthYorks", "ReviewID": "UR6850670", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights 9-12 Feb, My daughter, mum, sister and niece. We were very tired arriving into Kings Cross 20:20, qued for taxi to take us to hotel, \u00c2\u00a38 lady at the taxi rank ushered you to a cab so no que jumping, about 15 min trip to hotel. Check in was slow, I had phoned the week before to request rooms close to each other as we were a family, they gave us 1 room on floor 3 and 1 room on floor 6! Requested rooms closer together to be told none available, the man I spoke to a week earlier came out and said he would try and get us nearer together the next day, so off we went. Floor 3 was recently refurbished and looked lovely, our kids were very impressed.....they must have run out of money after that floor as floor 6 was like stepping back in time! Our room was clean but small for 3. As we were settling in reception called to say they could move us from floor 3 up to floor 5!!Not a chance her room was lovely! I said we would wait , He then found he could move us to floor 2, so we said that would be great, the upgrade room was a sofa bed and you would have broken your back if you slept on it for 3 days, not even suitable for a child. When it was out you couldnt open the wardrobe, spoke to the reception again and told him not acceptable we would make do with the tatty room on floor 6! As if by magic, another room for 3 was found , a suite no less!! we checked this out and although it was a sofa bed it was far superior to the other and you could get to the wardrobes!by this time it was 10:20pm. Air con easy to control, outside noise was noticable, we overlooked a block of residential flats and it got quite colourful at some times, breaking windows etc...Breakfast was great, we filled up for the days,we taxid most places, but on the sunday, concierge told us which bus to take from City Road, very easy, kids free on a weekend, standard price of \u00c2\u00a32 per adult, discovered you can buy a day ticked for \u00c2\u00a33.50 and go anywhere within 2 zones, ideal if your doing the touristy things like we were. Didnt go out on an evening as the area isnt over good, the security at the hotel was excellant, they didnt allow people to be hanging around. The pool was excellant, main reason we chose this hotel, the kids loved it, free towels, spa, steam room, pool quite, they had a ball! The restaurant only serves carvery on a weekend and this needs addressing, we only wanted a meal of the bar menu but were told we could not have this in the restaurant. They did accomodate us with a special price for the carvery and did the kids at a special rate.Wewere leaving London late that evening and they allowed us to leave our luggage there all day, the rain cut short our last day,so we asked if we could order some food sit have a coffe and get warm and dry, till we left, this was not a problem. On the whole they tried their best to accomodate us, a little more careful planning with rooms when families are involved and a change to the menu in the restaurant and this could be a wonderful base for a family in London.", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Doncaster, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "Nildesperanda", "ReviewID": "UR6832379", "Content": "Stayed for 2 nights in Feb 07 - him on business, me for leisure.

The central heating activated at 4 am, and whether or not the radiator was on the noise in the pipes was horrendous - we were awake for over an hour listening to the clanks and grunts!

When you do reach your room its clean but small and cramped with a 15 inch TV that is would be more a home in a small B&B. The hotel is also pretty poorly insulated for sound... once I turned in for the night, a fair amount of street noise is audible. I got up to check if the window was open but it wasn't. It was simply old and it rattled enough in its frame for you to be able to realise why the street noise came in so easily.

Therefore, we were looking for a reasonable hotel nearby for the night of 05/09/06. Booking a deluxe room with breakfast at approx \u00c2\u00a3186.00, seemed ok for our needs. How wrong we were!!!! We battled with air con for almost one hour - useless! Check in was almost unfriendly. Directions to our room quite vague. On opening the door I can only reinforce what others have previously said - a furnace!!! Also, the basin was completely cracked in half, bathroom stank!! Tumblers were dirty and curtains ripped. Overall room was dirty and when we asked ,\" When was this room last cleaned?\", we were told \" someone will come to clean it .\" We were also surprised to learn that , if two people occupy one room you will find additional towels dustily in the wardrobe (with built in light not working). We enquired whether someone could attend to the non existant air con and blown light bulbs while we went to dinner. We were assurred no problem. We had one drink in the bar before going out for dinner (only reason for going out was the appauling menu which sounded quite plasticised). Bar area was empty ,but pleasingly cool with its own air con! After returning from dinner we found our bathroom smelt just slightly better,but nothing else had been attended to. Worn out, we were in two minds whether do anything at all.The room was boiling,and very little had been done --- I complained! We had alreday been told there were no other rooms avaliable,but, suddenly the duty night manager Dinoh found us a suite close by with effective air con.We had to move ourselves and by this time (23.15) were thoroughly fed up with the whole thing and did not feel in the slighted bit rested. As for breakfast the following day, cool and poor coffee, juices insipid,cooked items not even average by Travel Lodge standards. When we enquired whether an omlette or some mushrooms may be avaliable we were told \"not now!\", some 30 minutes before breakfast was due to close. We concluded that maybe unreasonable demands were being placed on already unmotivated staff, but having travelled the world as a cabin crew member, on holidays worldwide, and innumerable corporate events - I can honestly say that this is the worst hotel(?) I have ever encountered. The only saving grace was our duty manager. A big \" thank you\" for your efforts in trying to make our stay better,you were the ONLY member of staff that we felt had ANY regard for the companies customers and pride within their own work.(wish you well for the future).

However, having experienced it first hand and returned home unscathed, I thought I should log my experiences to try and indicate that not every stay is a nightmare. After an initial delay checking in, (no fault on the hotels part) I was directed to my room which was thankfully in the main building. I have to say that the lobby, reception and indeed all the public areas were clean and tidy and generally in a good state of repair. The room itself was fine. Good size, not exactly the most up-to-date decor, but clean and tidy. Full marks to the house-keeping staff as the room and toilet were spotless on my return each evening. With regard to the location, OK so its near some council flats... so what ? If you'd looked a little closer you might have noticed how many were clearly privately-owned and well looked after. I took the courtesy bus to the tube station on the morning I checked out, but the rest of the time I walked to the City which only took 15-20 mins. Next, the staff - who have had some rather harsh treatment in some reviews. I would like to state quite clearly that every single staff member I dealt with was professional, pleasant and polite. Most of the staff may not have had English as their first language but I could not fault the level of service they provided. And, I'm not sure what kind of service one reviwer expected at a breakfast buffet... how hard can it be to walk up and help yourself!!? I thought the breakfast staff did a fine job, and the food itself was perfectly adequate. However, it wasn't all good. The worst thing was the mattress. It had seen better times. Or rather it had been the scene of too many better times !! It was clearly worn out. It also had a rather unpleasant aroma which I won't speculate too much about ! At any rate it should have been replaced. The wardrobe also smelled a bit musty. The hair-dryer in the bathroom didn't work, and neither did the fridge. The wall-paper was also a bit tattered under the window. None of these were crucial to me personally, but its little details like these that can cloud your overall experience. I also appreciate that I may have been more critical if I'd been paying rather than my company, but on the whole this hotel was perfectly adequate for a business trip, and although I certainly wouldn't rave about it, I would be quite happy to recommend it to others.", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNot bad at all.\u201d", "Author": "Leanne_777", "ReviewID": "UR5708524", "Content": "Our experience at this hotel was fairly good, thankfully.

They also gave me a name of a Thistle manager to use as leverage. So I tried for a final time and refused to take no as an answer, eventually they informed me the booking was on the next screen down where no one had bothered to check. When they finally tried to book the room which they had mysteriously found, they told me there was a problem with the computer system and they could only book one person into the room and not the both of us, but they told me that they would put a note on the reservation to say there would be two of us. No one sent me a confirmation email or anything by post, I had to telephone and request confirmation, which was then sent. When we arrived at the hotel there was a small queue in front of us but only one person checking in/out at reception. There were however at least five people behind the desk trying to ignore the growing queue, it was as if they didn't want our money. Eventually I had to ask in a loud voice if there were going to be anyone else checking people in and immediately three members of staff decided they would help check in people. The woman checking us in had a bad grasp of English and could not understand what we were saying and we could not understand her badly broken English. Another of the wedding party had started being checked in at the same time as us and had been checked in ten minutes before we eventually managed to get checked in. We had travelled a long way to get to the hotel and the lack of communication left us standing at reception for over 20 minutes while she tried to find our room cards, our booking on the system, they fact it only said one person on the booking because of the initally computer problems when we booked. She then informed us that breakfast finished at 10 am on a Saturday and a Sunday, the other members of the booking group were told 10.30am and 11am. When we managed to get our room keys, we had to ask where the lifts were as this information was not forthcoming, when we got to the fourth floor the blast of hot air hit us, as if we were in a furnace. There was no air conditioning or windows open in the corridors, the carpet was ripped in places and our room was located down a corridor so badly lit that at night you could hardly see where you were going, several of the lights had blown and noone had bothered to change them. The extractor fan in our bathroom was not working and there was mould on the shower curtain, other than that the room was fine other than it being tiny. On Saturday night after the wedding I went back to our hotel room and tried to watch some television as I was getting changed, an old message suddenly appeared from Friday night. After trying to delete the message time after time with no luck, I rang down to reception and no one bothered to answer, so I had to physically go down to reception and ask them to sort it out, which they did, I missed the end of the film I was watching. The breakfast each morning was very average, I have stayed in many hotels where the breakfast was to a very high standard, so I know an average breakfast when I experience one. The staff could not speak english well enough to deal with any requests and I had the distinct impression that they didn't want to be there, complaining to each other within earshot of the customers. All in all quite a disappointment, I will never stay at this hotel again and will be telling all my friends and family how bad it is.

Admittedly the area is not great however we did not feel threatened at all - but with two youngish children we wouln't feel comfortable walking around after dark. After spending the afternoon in London we returned to the hotel and our room was ready, it was quite big - it said Exceutive Premier on the door so I assumed we had been upgraded - it had a large double bed, a settee bed and also a single bed and still had plenty of room for a desk and two chairs. The room including the large bathroom was very clean, it had an air conditioning unit and all the usual equipment you would expect in a 4* hotel, (hairdryer, trouser press, iron etc). The children headed straight to the swimming pool and which they thought was great. I was a bit worried about breakfast after reading the reviews but again it was faultless. There was plenty of food both \"full english\" and also continental and although the most of the staff spoke little english we were served well. On Easter Sunday all the children were given an Easter egg which I thought was a nice touch. One word of advice regarding the breakfast - if you arrive after 8.00am it does start to get busy and they do take the queue across to the other block. Overall I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel and would recommend it to anyone, however I would only return to stay there if it was just with my husband, it is just that bit too far from the tube station when you have children.

On the downside, as mentioned in other reviews, it is a long way from civilisation but I should dispel a few myths about the area. Having been born and brought up in London, I know it's not the prettiest of areas. This doesn't mean it is particularly unsafe. Clerkenwell (to give the area it's proper name), and Finsbury were where gentry lived in Victorian times. Although the area has been neglected since then, it is still likely to be the next up-and-coming area as it is an easy commute to the City and the West End. There aren't many good restaurants around but go a couple of blocks to Goswell Road or Old Street and it gets better. If you head for Hoxton Square near Old Street, the first signs of regeneration are taking shape. The area has become very fashionable as it has a number of up-market bars, clubs and restaurants and is popular with city workers. It is only a matter of time before it sneaks up on Clerkenwell and improves the place. Bear with it. It really isn't as bad as it looks. However, don't head north towards King's Cross as that is rough.

However, were more helpful via telephone. 2. This hotel I assume mainly caters for suits, who won't need to use the gym facilities, so this is not a perk for everyone. 3. Had to ask for a double room rather than a twin room at check in, even though this was requested during booking There are a few facts that i do not perceive as problems with a reason attached. Firstly, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from either Barbican or Old Street station. This is clearly stated by the website and staff - see the map on the website before moaning about proximity. Secondly, I did not come across the second buidling, so I cannot speak for people who happened to be placed there. The hotel itself is fairly nice. Honestly. Thirdly, I agree that the surrounding area is a little grim, but you can avoid walking through by asking for a mini cab or a black cab to the nearest main tube/bus stop to prevent further worry. If you book this hotel via an offer, I recommend you double check that you get Breakfast included, and that you receive the bed type you require. I also recommend printing out a map of the journey from Old Street/Barbican if you are not familiar with London. I hope this is more helpful than some of the other reviews I have read.

The room was very small, VERY old, cold, dirty and the walls were VERY thin and there was a visible gap under the main door?! What a massive step down and disappointment I thought! And there were no vacant rooms in the main building! I can not stress this enough: THE NIGHT I STAYED IN THAT ROOM MARRED WHAT HAD BEEN A GREAT LONG WEEKEND UP TO THAT POINT.

The bar in the main building, while expensive, served some very good food and drinks. It has a really nice atmosphere and is not at all like many other hotel bars I have been in.

Unsatisfied with this my partner came back into the hotel, spoke to a different person at the front desk and was asked if we would prefer a twin or double!

This brings me onto the location, its about 10 mins walk to the tube which is Ok but the area is not very desirable, especially at night - so just like you would need to anywhere - take the necessary precautions. So...the room - its was too small, dark and very dated. There were scuff marks and paint chipped from the walls. The bathroom smelt musty and was tiny - only just room to sit on the loo! The loo didnt seem to fully flush, maybe due to an attempt from the hotel to save water. Breakfast was average but not much choice and the waiter service was very poor, we had almost finished breakfast by the time we were asked if we would like tea/coffee!
