When we checked in we were told that due to a delay in new carpets being fitted our rooms were not ready but they could take us to a different hotel for one night. We could choose in which hotel we could have breakfast and they would take us to and from the hotels in their own transport. We didn't use it in the end as the hotel was only a 10 minutes away and it was quicker to walk.We were assured we would get very nice upper rooms on our return the next morning. Although nicely decorated, the rooms we were first shown for our second night were relatively small and we didn't feel we had an upgrade. We were given a second choice of rooms which were marginally larger. By then we were feeling pretty fed up as we wanted to begin our exploration of this fantastic city so we accepted them. On our return we found lovely bowls of fruit. We thought they were standard but maybe they were by way of an apology. Some of the staff especially the maids and waiters were friendly and smiley. Others would speak politely but abruptly. There were no plugs for the bath or hand basin ( a bit odd for a four star hotel). Breakfast was fantastic, the mix of foods was really interesting as well as the people watching... so many different nationalities. The waiters were helpful, friendly, polite and efficient. The views were wonderful. Only one small gripe the juices were processed squash or you pay extra for fresh. There is loud music playing until one so if you need an early night you need to pick your room carefully. Or just make sure you are so tired it wont matter. The beds were very comfortable and the air con was quiet. I just wish they had let us know sooner about the problem and I'm not totally convinced that we were compensated enough for our inconvenience.Overall I would recommend this hotel for the terrace views, comfortable beds excellent breakfast and closeness to the trams for getting around.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWorth the money spent\u201d", "Author": "viveksr", "ReviewID": "UR123593961", "Content": "I have been to Istanbul on many occasions but this was the first time I was travelling with my family.

We would like to thank the hotel for putting things right straight away and they should be commended for this. This is a sign of a good hotel. The room and bed were comfortable and we enjoyed the facilities on the top floor - the pool and bar. There is also a gym but even with the best will in the world, we didn't quite make it there. Maybe next time! The breakfast fare is plentiful and there is something for everyone - even if various bits are not quite to your taste. I discovered two delicious Turkish cheeses via breakfast. There is a lovely view of Istanbul to enjoy while eating. If there is one improvement I could suggest, maybe the rooftop jacuzzi could be operational during the colder months.

The location was excellent for sightseeing in Istanbul. You could walk to most of the tourist areas, or walk a couple of blocks down to the tram line, if you didn't want to walk the complete distance anywhere. For example, it was only 2 trams stops to the Cemberlitas Hamami Turkish baths. They were repaving the street and sidewalks while we were there, so getting to the hotel from a taxi meant having to walk a block, but that wasn't a problem. We ate at the outdoor restaurant there and enjoyed the food and the service. Our room was a suite, with a TV that swiveled so you could see it from the bed, or from the big bathtub (through the glass wall). I only ran into this TV once, as it hangs down from the ceiling. There was a big walk-in closet in this room, which was helpful in keeping the clutter in the room to a minimum. Miray, the Guest Service Supervisor gave us a lot of help and advice, which proved to be very useful. She directed us to several things we wouldn't have seen otherwise. We even had a nice chat with Muhammet, the manager. The restaurant for breakfast was on the seventh floor, and had a nice view of the city. As a bonus, you could choose to sit outside on the terrace if you wanted to. There were 3 elevators, and one was definitely faster than the others, which seemed strange. The pool was on an upper floor, and was nice, but of a constant depth, which might be too deep for small children. This seemed to be an architechtural characteristic of all pools in Turkey, as we saw it at other hotels, too. The jacuzzi was a floor above the pool, but was a bit cool for us. However, the loungers were very nice. We tried the disco one night, but apparently there was a mix-up after we placed our drink order, and we never got our drink. But since we were tired, we didn't stay long anyway. At the end of our visit, they arranged for a private minibus to take us to the airport, and we'd like to thank them for that, as my companion was having difficulty doing any physical activity by this time (as she was sick). All in all, a very pleasant stay in this hotel.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bucharest", "Title": "\u201cnice Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "cdanaioana", "ReviewID": "UR118048454", "Content": "Nice place to stay if you want to be near the Grand Bazaar.

Upon arrival, they said they had upgraded us to nicer rooms. The rooms were a good size and comfortable, and the furnishings appeared to be quite new. There were big windows in the rooms but not much of a view however. But both rooms had beautiful plates of fruit waiting for us on arrival, which we devoured right away! The location seemed excellent to us. There was no problem walking to any of the sights in Old Town. There is plenty of shopping and restaurants in the area also. Wi-Fi was free which was a nice touch, since still many of the nicer hotels in Europe still charge you 25 or 30 Euros per day for using the internet. My husband swam every day in the pool and it was long enough to do short laps. Our favorite part of the hotel was the breakfast. It was our favorite hotel breakfast of our whole vacation in Europe. There were all kinds of Turkish cuisine plus plenty of recognizable items for Americans too. It was big but without being overly crowded. Actually, one of the most interesting parts was seeing the other hotel guests as there was quite an array of different family cultures represented at the different tables. It was almost like \"Casablanca\" or something. Best of all, the buffet was already open for breakfast when we were leaving for the airport at 6 am!

Good Stuff The Hotel is located in a very central location, no more than 10 minutes walk from the major tourist destinations which is great, however this does mean you are exposed to Istanbul's less reserved nature 24/7 but don't let that stop you, Istanbul is a great city and this was only reinforced by our stay at Hotel Zurich. The pictures were taken by us three days ago. We stayed for 5 days and really enjoyed our stay, the room was great. However we did upgrade for a very fair price as the first room was just a little small for us, big bed, and kept clean and quiet, A/C worked well, bathroom was awesome, but be sure to have no inhibitions! Food was good, in fact the main menu served at both the Rooftop and the Front Restaurant was the best food we ate in that part of the city. Staff were great, friendly, polite and helpful, especially Guest Relations, thank-you for adding to our stay. Having a rooftop to get away from everything was nice, space in the city is limited so being able to relax was nice. We never used the spa so can't comment but prices seemed fair. If there were negatives, breakfast was usual for that part of the world, carpet in the corridors was possibly a poor choice, but we would stay again as it was a good hotel.

Long story -short we booked 2 rooms in this hotel (1 room double beds and 1 room triple beds) in total 5 beds and we booked it over one month from our arrival date. we arrived (only 4 of us made it (one guy didn't show up) and the man behind front desk told us that our rooms are not ready he will put us in a temporary rooms for today until tomorrow (remember that we booked it over a month before we arrived) so we said: ok since we all had more that 14 hours for flight time and we just wanted a bed to crash on. the next day the did move us to new rooms (2 double bed rooms) so i went to the front desk asking him why are we in a double bed room while we ordered one of the rooms to be triple (and i couldn't believe his answer), he said why would you need 3 beds and you are only 2 guests in the room. i told him i want it because i paid for it and i should get what i paid for and he said but you are only two people in the room why should i give you a room with three beds (it was like I was living in a different planet where people have a different logic) and i repeated my self i want my three bed room because i paid for three beds room or you pay me back the difference, and that's where he lost it and started screaming and saying I am not paying you anything, go back to the agency you booked the hotel from and ask them to pay you back. so I insisted on talking to the manager and he made me wait over 3 hours until he got back to me with a very bad attitude saying that the manager is not here but he will try to get me what i paid for tomorrow. Next day we were moved again, and this time to a three beds room but that was just the beginning of the descending to hell: 1- Cleaning service: the first day nothing (not even clean towels) the next day clean towels but no new bed sheets (mind you it was really humid and you sweet all night) so we told them if we can get bed sheets changed, and the cleaning lady came (and i was there in the room) she pulled all the blankets of the bed and through them on the floor and she changed the bed sheet and left LEAVING THE BLANCKETS ON THE FLOOR FOR CRYING OUT LOAD. 2- Second night of sleep we ended up with bed bugs bite. 3- hot tub on the roof looks very nice a bubbly but freezing cold so I asked if the heater can be turned on so we can have a relaxing time and they said no we don't turn it on. 4- The breakfast is a 2 star quality. 5- I was ready to pay 100 dollar ti any one just to see someone smiling. Every one who was working in the hotel made us feel like they are doing us a huge favor for working there. 6- The food quality in general was poor to fair. All that would be ok if we could find someone in the whole city that can speak English or at least understand it we couldn't communicate at all so we stayed within walking distance from the hotel at all time.

To the old center - about half an hour of the slow walking or 3-4 tram stops but the atmosphere is really different. It's rather the hotel for those who came to Istanbul for the cheap shopping than for those who came for attractions. The room was quite big but the furniture is rather old. The view is directly to the dirty street and the walls of another hotels. The textile looksdusty and unclean. The only one perfect thing in this hotel (but seems like it's the feature of lot of hotels in the district) is a roof restaurant. That was a real pleasure to have a breakfast on the roof with the view on sunny Marmara sea- very romantic. But after the breakfast - we've preferred to spend the whole day outside and return to the district and hotel only late at night.

We were then told that even though we'd booked our 2 rooms a few months ago, they would not be located on the same floor. To top that off, the 2 deluxe twin rooms that we paid for couldn't be more different. One of the rooms was a bog standard 3 star room with questionable cleanliness and the other one was heaven and beautifully decorated! Breakfast in the morning was interesting - we had to pay 6 lira for an dire orange juice and the tables were filthy. Then when we asked for an iron which on the website is \"available on request\", we were told in broken English that there was no iron but an ironing service is offered which you have to pay for obviously! One day we made the terrible mistake of ordering room service thinking that pizza is the safe choice but we were wrong! What came up to us was soggy and unappetizing. The most frustrating part was trying to explain what we wanted over the phone to someone who clearly didn't understand English, so much so that he had to come to our room instead and we pointed on the menu what we wanted! Feeling adventurous one evening, we decided to check out the hotel's disco and to our dismay, we found a seedy bar with questionable clientele and feared our own safety! To top it off, on our last day we asked if they could order us a big taxi as even though there were 4 of us, we had 4 suitcases which would not fit in the boot. But never fear, Hotel Zurich is here who proceeded to squash all our luggage in a regular taxi and 2 suitcases were hanging out!
