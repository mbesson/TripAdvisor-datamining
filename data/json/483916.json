We had a bungalow with a fan wich was fine. A simple breakfast was served at the outdoor livingroom.

We requested the superior room and got the honeymoon suite which after 36 years of marriage was fun! The superior rooms are in the rice fields and very pretty and private. Crazy design of rooms but we got used to that as we found it all over Bali. The last night at Agung Raka (we requested to stay on) we had to stay in the regular room which was OK but not much privacy and the bedroom could really only fit the bed and not much else. The bathroom was up to date but huge. In this hotel all bedrooms are upstairs and bathrooms downstairs but we sort of got used to it. The nasi goreng they served for breakfast was excellent. The American breakfast wasn't very good. One of the best things about Agung Raka was that it was a little way out of Ubud with all the noise etc and the free shuttle service to any where in town and back at any time saved our feet and purses!", "Date": "Oct 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR194977156", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Craighall56"}, {"Content": "Good value for money.

We stayed two nights at the Agung Raka in Ubud in July, 2004. Like so many things in Bali, the rate is very negotiable. We had the queen bungalow. It was spectacular to look at; but, not all that comfortable in terms of lighting and furniture. However, the bathroom and the view are incredible. The veranda and the rice paddies make up for whatever may be lacking in hot water or chairs. It is exceptionally beautiful. You are surrounded by rice paddies and serenity.
