The Casino Royale had very nice rooms with coffee and a refrigerator. We choose the lowest price which didn't have a great view but was comfortable and clean. They were even able to put family members down the hall from us even though they registered weeks after we did.

I've never stayed in the hotel, but, have spent many hours playing at Casino Royale. Their bar offers $1 tourist drink specials to get you in the door. Usually some smallish frozen drink or a 12 oz. domestic beer (Michelob?). But, that's not all the bar/casino offers. It's a great place to play some video poker while tossing back some well priced drinks. You can buy 4 drinks at Casino Royale for less then the price of one drink at other strip casino bars and I'm not talking about the $1 specials. The wait staff are fast & friendly. The bartendars are GREAT. Darrell, one of the bartendars, always seems to be there when the wife and I visit. He is GREAT! Offering fantastic service and great conversation in regard to all the latest sporting events & life in general. He and his fellow staff members really make you feel welcome. Tips seem to be greatly appreciated and are well deserved. Tip well and you will treated like a king at Casino Royale. True, Casino Royale may not be for everyone. There's no marbled atriums, circus acts, giant buffets or volcano....but, all of those things are VERY CLOSE to Casino Royale. Casino Royale sets in the center of the strip near Imperial Palace, Harrah's, Venetian and Ceasar's Palace. It's a great spot to get your Vegas evening started with some drinks and gaming. The casino offers good slot play and pretty good video poker. There are several BJ tables and Craps as well. The folks at the table games always seem to be loud and in a party mood!! It's a great atmosphere that caters to 'normal' folks. There is a 'Tix Tonight' is the casino offering discount show/dining tickets as well as several fast food type restaurants. A Denny's is next door as well. If you can't have a good time at Casino Royale, you probably are a very boring person.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cBest Location\u201d", "Author": "Joey510", "ReviewID": "UR125963682", "Content": "We stayed at Casino Royle for a few nights, the location of the hotel was fabulous you don't need a car to get anywhere, perfect location.

Cons: location of hotel check-in and room access not so obvious, no wireless available (although there is a business center). My biggest complaint was the window of my room on the 'even' (right) side of the floor overlooked what appeared to be a major recycling station next door. There was a large dumpster, and bottles were being sorted and emptied at all hours. Imagine your weekly recyclables being picked-up and dumped in the truck, and quadruple that sound all night. I'm not too picky about sounds, but the sounds of clanging bottles woke me several times each night. I would recommend getting a room on the 'odd' side (i.e. left) of the facility to minimize this sound. Another tip: they don't have a taxi area, so they will either call a taxi for you, or you can walk over to Harrahs next door and hire one of the many that are always waiting there.

This is Vegas on a budget, right smack dab in the heart of the action. Ok, we actually stayed here in March of 2009, but that option wasn't available and I'm trying to catch up with my reviews. Was supposed to be coming to Vegas to see the Monster Jam World Finals with my bro. Well, the dork took the word Jam literally and did that to me at the last minute. Was originally booked at the Trop next door but now that I was footing 100% of the bill and had a family vacation booked 26 hours after I arrived home from this one I was looking to save money. An online search found this hotel for something like $35.00 a night, we switched names on the airline ticket and off my wife and I went. To say we weren't expecting much would be an understatement, but we just figured we'd groove on the whole cheap and dirty aspect of the whole week, we were attending monster races after all, YEEHAA!!!! I'm not going to write a pros cons review here as if you find cons in a $35.00 a night hotel you are tripping on a totally different plane that we are. Here goes, checkin was in this little side room off of the Casino floor, the desk clerk was pleasant in a two/ three star kinda way, we received some coupons for relatively useless crap, like 2 millers for a dollar, just in case one dollar a miller was too high falutin' for your budget.....lol. Your card key gains you access to the hotel which is accessed through a fairly institutional looking glass door, again off the casino floor. The first thing we noticed was fairly grubby hallways, narrow, old, shabby carpet, then we opened our room door and were blown away, they have renovated. You go from this nasty two star roach motel hallway into what felt like an older niche' hotel room. Though this is the farthest thing from the Belaggio, it was a very nice clean trendy room. The bed was amazingly comfortable with nice fresh linens, flat screen TV,we loved it. In march the pool was closed but it was just an old school kidney pool anyway. So after we unpacked and did the obligatory bounce on the bed we headed out into the Casino for a couple of drinks to unwind. Casino Royale, can you think of a cooler name than that, has $1 Miller Beer and Daquiris, that's right, One Frikkin Dollar, and the fellow behind the bar was flying, great service, always a smile. A lot of Vegas is starting to get weird with cheapos like us, they are lucky to be getting $100.00 from us through gambling when we are there and for those like us they are starting weird one drink at a time policies, or beer by the glass only for free, so a buck for a cold bottle of beer, couldn't be better. Yes, they aren't building Vegas on our gambling that's for sure, If you want to be in the heart of things, this is it, literally. Look at a map, they could not be in a better location. We walked everywhere and were quite happy to come home to our comfortable little room at night. Chipoltles is right next door and we are drooling because we are heading back to Vegas this July, eat there, yummmmm. This is a no frills, cheap, in the heart of the action, dare I say, Boutique??? Hotel. Would I bring my kids here, hell no, but if you are looking to let loose on a budget it's a great little piece of old style Vegas. Would I stay here again, probably not, but that has nothing to do with the hotel itself, it's me, I'm a bit of a snob. But never say never. We went to Vegas, didn't spend a lot of cash, drank more Miller than any man has a right too and had a blast, what more can you ask for. Then was back two weeks later at our timeshare, very different vacation...lol.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermontville, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cBest Bang For The Buck\u201d", "Author": "songsinger1", "ReviewID": "UR103797090", "Content": "We had heard some sorted things about he Casino Royale, but happy to report that none were true.

That is until I learned they had me scheduled to leave a day earlier then I expected. That wasn't their fault nor their problem, BUT when I asked to stay an extra night, (knowing I'd pay a higher price,) I never imagined the rate was more than QUADRUPLE (that right -4Xs!) the cost I had paid for the five nights I booked through AAA! The front desk quoted me the price of $169.99 for on week night, telling me there was a convention in town and ALL hotels on the strip was at premium rates! Well, thank God for the internet and places like here where I can check and see what other hotels are charging. As it turned out, there were several hotels, (including the once right next door to Casino Royale) asking less than $50 for that night! $44 a night? Great deal! $169 a night? NOT!

They do have a nice food court with a fair variety but don't expect anything spectacular. Now my gaming experience was AMAZING here despite its low key old school feeling. I was very inexperienced on the table when I went to vegas and I had chosen craps as my game to play. The dealers were very helpful and will give you tips that will help you keep playing as long as possible. I already had a strategy in mind from playing online and they helped me execute it to a T. The people that visit this place know what they are looking for as well. 3 dollar craps tables with 20x odds, you will find that NOWHERE else on the strip. Blackjack ran 5 dollars as well and were pretty freindly dealers. Only problem I did see was that their were way to few tables and they could get crowded, but the people who play here are what makes the games fun. Another thing I was not expecting from this place was the good looking cocktail waitresses, don't get me wrong their were a few that weren't that great but a majority were pretty nice on the eyes.

The room was very spacious and looked as if it had been recently updated. The complimentary in room safe and dry bar with coffeemaker was a great amenity with no additional costs. The bathroom was spacious and stocked with plenty of pluses and plenty of towels. Upon check-in I encounterd a very friendly host. Considering it was late in the evening he was very quick and thoughtful. He even mentioned nearby hotels that offered free shuttles to other locations and reminded me that the hotel offered a luggage holding area if my check out and flight did not correlate. Now, there were a few negatives. The walls seemed a bit thin. I could hear people coming and going in the hall and could hear the tv in the room next to me. My room was located next to the outdoor courtyard area that sits between Casino Royale and Harrahs and there was some type of loudspeaker going on and on. I went to Vegas to run the marathon so I spent more time in the room then a usual, so these things were probably were more noticeable. After checking in I went down to the Casino to sign up for the \"fun book\" they offer. The hostess was rather curt and did not seem happy. Since it seemed I was bothering her as she was processing the request, I questioned why they didn't just offer the book when I checked in, she never acknowledged I even asked her a question. Overall the Casino Royale is a very nice hotel. The offer a great location and a nice room, other hotels in Las Vegas may be nicer and offer more amenities but you will pay for that.

We're on a budget, and being we stayed two nights during the week we got a good deal on our room at $55 a night. We value location over having lots of \"extras\" because honestly, how long are you in your room in Vegas anyway? Pros: Excellent location! Centrally located on the strip, the Venetian and Harrah's are right next door and the Mirage is across the street. We could easily access everything located in the center of the strip. We drove to Vegas so we had our car with us, and the parking structure was no fuss, no muss and easily accessible. Rooms were just as pictured on the website, and actually a bit bigger than I expected. The bed was quite comfortable and we had excellent water pressure in the shower. There is an Outback Steakhouse, Denny's, Subway, and Noble Roman Pizza located here. We ate at the Denny's twice for the sake of price and convenience, and each meal was great! The casino bar offers $1 margarita's and $1 Michelob Light and Michelob Original Lager. Cons: Figuring out where the front desk for check-in was a bit confusing upon our arrival. You have to enter through the rear of the building due to construction, and walk through the casino to check in. We read a few reviews which people complained about this same problem, and it was still a bit confusing for us once we got inside. Because of construction there is noise coming from outside, and we had a view of it. The walls are also paper thin. We could hear everything going on in the hallway, and at times we felt like our window was open because we could hear the construction so well. But really, coming to Vegas to get a great nights rest? C'mon...I forgot to pack my toothbrush, so we called down to the front desk to see if they had those cheap-o toothbrushes, but they didn't so that was kind of an inconvenience. The high-speed internet access is not in the room, it's downstairs in their lobby area. The margarita's served at the casino bar for $1 didn't have much tequila in them. It may seem very minor, but I thought our hallway smelled \"funky.\" Luckily the smell didn't carry over into our room! Overall, the hotel is a good value and you can't beat the location. That said, I personally would not pay $100 a night to stay here, because there are just too many \"little\" things that are not offered here that you might expect (like the front desk to carry some toothbrushes) from a hotel. The staff members we encountered were friendly, but don't expect to be treated like royalty here.

The rooms have been recently remodeled - very clean and with comfortable bed/linens and flat screen TV. While the room / rate exceeded my expectations, there were a few downsides to this hotel. First - if you will have a vehicle, be prepared to experience a small challenge getting into/out of the hotel's parking facility. It has direct access onto the strip (good), but without any type of pedestrian traffic control (bad). This means you will have to wait unitl one or two or fifty kind souls stop walking to let your car pass. On the other hand, if you don't have a vehicle - you can't beat the convenience or the price! Second - most of the rooms appear to face into the service areas for Casino Royale and Harrah's. Our \"view\" was of Harrah's employees smoke/break area and vendor delivery areas. Heard various delivery trucks in and out throughout the night. But - how often are you in your room in Vegas, anyways? Third - the windows have very nice plantation shutters - look really nice, but do not block out the sun like the traditional black-out window coverings you find in most Vegas hotels. Overall, a pleasant \"budget\" stay on the strip this time around, but will probably not return based simply on vehicle access - but if you are going the shuttle/cab/walking route, you can't beat the value and convenience of staying on the strip for under $75/night!", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cFor it's location you can't beat the price!\u201d", "Author": "ttab", "ReviewID": "UR36087973", "Content": "With some bad reviews, major renos going on and a small gambling area that we thought would be really smokey, we really expected the worse, but were totally wrong!

Looked everywhere and wanted to stay on the strip but the prices for 3-5 star hotels were in the 3 digit range so for $69 USD a night for the end of June weekend at the Casino Royale, this place was a steal!! Upon arriving at the parking lot in the back, the place looked less than appealing because of the renos but the front clerk said it would be done by August. From the parking lot to the front desk, it was a short walk, the two front clerks were really nice, no wait at 11pm. Got our room key and walked passed the gambling area which did not reek of cigarettes. I mean there were cigarette smells here and there but you wouldn't be inhaling anymore than walking behind someone who was smoking outside on the strip. There's a huge locked sliding glass door that separates the hotel rooms from the casino and everything else which was great and it's located across from the Ben & Jerry's ice cream store and one of the main entrances that leads you outside, another happy surprise! They gave us room 318 and it was nicely renovated, it looks as they advertised on their website. Beds were high and comfy, enough space for two small kids to run around and there was even a huge flat screen tv to compliment the room decor. This time maid service listened to us when we asked them not to come in our room to clean up....lol. Lots of hot water for shower, cold a/c works fine, small fridge was handy but no microwave for fast convenient heating drinks/food. There is a small coffee maker that we used to warm my kid's milk, which was fine. Night sleep was good, no noise from outside at all.

Front desk is right off the strip basically, as is the entrance to the hotel rooms. Very convenient. There is NO valet parking, but the lot is pretty close to the hotel. Not a long walk from most areas of the garage to the front desk. The \"good\" spaces outside the garage next to the casino are less than a minute's walk to the front desk. This place does not claim to be a resort (it's certainly not) but it is located NEAR some nice resorts. The rooms are basic, but clean as far as I could see. No bugs, blood, or guts that I could find, and this place is pretty old. Many, including the one I stayed in, have been recently remodeled though, and so really didn't look bad at all. I'd say the room I was in was better than a Motel 6 for instance. No floor to ceiling windows or anything fancy, but it was clean and functional. The noise from LVB was only slightly annoying, and earplugs took care of that. I slept real good. No loud parties in the hall, and they have security cameras too I believe. The \"hotel\" part of the casino actually runs east from the strip, and has four floors and 152 rooms; while the casino itself parallels the strip for the most part. The whole place is kind of like an \"L\" shape. Some of the rooms at the \"crux\" of the L are pretty much right off the strip actually, and it took me about 15 seconds to get from my room to Las Vegas Blvd from mine. I could also walk into Harrah's and be at their blackjack \"Party Pit\" in about 30 seconds...probably quicker than anyone STAYING at Harrah's. The gym next door at Harrah's is also only about a two or three minute walk from Casino Royale. I had NO problems with the front desk, and they seemed very accommodating to me, though I've read complaints from others. Maybe I was just lucky, or it was a weekday check in I don't know. At any rate, I'm going to be staying there AGAIN later this month. They COMPED me a room for three nights, and I didn't really think I'd get comped at my level of play. This is a BIG PLUS for me as a gambler. Other casinos I wouldn't have even earned a lousy (and it probably would have been lousy!) buffet! Granted the rooms here are always inexpensive, but I liked that they thought enough of my play to actually comp me a room. Heck, they only have 152 rooms! Maid service was good. I had no complaints. They also have free Internet on the first floor for guests. I felt pretty secure in the hotel; and the rooms have a safe as well as a fridge and I think maybe even a microwave (can't remember.) T.V. worked okay but not too many channels. I wouldn't say the reception (cable?) was all that great either. But it did the job for watching the local news at night, which is about all I used it for. There IS construction going on still I believe, so I'd ask for an even-numbered room if they have one. That would be on the Harrah's side of the building. I'd also try to get as close to LVB as possible or else you may hear them crashing bottles into the trash cans after the bars empty them from Harrah's next door. This is Harrah's noise, so don't blame the Royale for this at least. There is a Subway sandwich place on site, as well as a Denny's. Next door (30 seconds from my room) is a McDonald's; and below that is a food court with Chinese and Mexican \"mall food.\" Outback Restaurant (the busiest in the WORLD I was told) is upstairs and they will comp you if you gamble enough. It was good and I ate lunch there several times. You can watch the peeps walk by from there as well as the Denny's. I eat this stuff at home, and think most of the Vegas fancy restaurants are not worth the money unless you're trying to impress your girl. You can be in the Mirage Casino in less than three minutes from the front of Casino Royale. Heck, what can I say? I like this place! The plusses (location, price, convenience, room safe, fridge etc.) far outweigh the minuses in my opinion. The minuses would be the smoke in the casino (and I SMOKE!) The casino is pretty well-worn as well, and yes SOME of the dealers are downright indifferent or even rude at times. They probably don't get paid much. I DID have a great experience at their craps tables though. Best odds on the strip from what I can see, and I found ALL the craps guys and gals to be nice and not rude at all. There was one guy there actually who should have been working in a better place he was so good. He knew what I was going to do before I did, and kept track of my bets real well! Of course I was tipping the boys some too, which I'm sure got their attention, but they were nice to everyone from what I could see. Slots were not that loose in my opinion. I'd try El Cortez downtown Vegas for loose slots. It's a dump, too, but does have loose slots.

I must be used to run down little pubs at home, because I did not think even the casino was all that smokey. It is easy to catch the Deuce near Casino Royale.

The comforter was old, thin, torn and had cigarette holes in it. The bed was soggy and had plastic on it. Worst sleep ever and I was dead tired. TV was a 19 inch analog cable televsion that didn't get a good picture. It cut in and out by moving the cable wire! I guess the bathroom was OK... Clean, but our tub was stopped up where water was coming up to your ankles! EEK! We did call and a guy came and fixed it within 5 minutes. So that was good, I guess. It looks decent from the outside, but it is like an old MOTEL 6 that hasn't been updated since 1960!!! in the back side of it. There is no valet parking like the other hotels. Horrible! I haven't seen an elevator that old ever! You get lost trying to find out where you check in to the hotel. There are no signs and no is around to help you find it. The phone was so old~ and It was way across the room where usually they are on the nightstand! It had this small kitchen area, that had a fridge i think and a safe. No Iron, had to request it. So i guess all and all, if you want a crappy hotel just to sleep in during a vegas trip, pick this one. But if you really want to experience all the cool things that the other hotels would offer, go somewhere else. You know like a fitness room, spa, pool , wireless interent, shops and resturants. They had no room service or any resturants inside the hotel. So my recommendations to stay in Vegas if you want a nice time are the Luxor, Wynn, Mandalay Bay, Ceaser's Palace, MGM Grand, Venetian, PLanet Hollywood, Just any of the main big ones.

We were looking at booking about 1-2 months before we arrived and at the same time - prices for strip hotels were at least DOUBLE or more since weekends are most expensive- we paid $85 US/night and booked through TravelWorm. We were sceptical about booking through a lesser known website like Travelworm- but we did a lot of research and found out that they are based out of LasVegas- Plus the person we talked to was knowledgable and friendly- There were no problems with the booking. Booking though the website was cheaper than booking directly - even IF you had AAA. Location can't be beat considering the price. A downside is that taxis can not or do not want to stop here to pick people up. We waited 1.5hr on Sunday for a taxi to come (after calling and recalling 3 times) The only reason we got a taxi was that one was dropping off people and we happened to flag it down in time. A word of advice- either don't bother calling for a taxi (have your own car!) or walk to the next big hotel (not a short walk either!) to catch a taxi. Close to the Venetian & Harrahs, across from the Mirage- Denny's, Outback, and some other fast-food type places close by. About the accomodations: Check-in: -located within the casino... slighty hard to find... quick though- under 15 minutes for everything. Room: we stayed on the fourth floor, the very furthest room down the hallway- it was a long hike- but we're into exercise and didn't really mind--unfortunately this particular room did NOT have a fridge like it should've...Safe was available.. Room cleanliness was decent- didn't notice any weird smells... only the middle elevator was working... Since we were at the end of the hall- we had no problems with noise. Beds:-ok, we aren't very particular and can fall asleep on anything Bathroom:- brightly lit, decently clean, good water pressure-- nothing fancy here- but was adequate Pool- we didn't use- looked small- but I suppose if you were the only ones using it it would be ok- Other:-Ice maker was decent- didn't have to wait too long for a large amount of ice. (we didn't have a fridge and therefore had to resort to the ice-in-the-sink method of keeping out drinks cold) In summary- this would be the hotel for people that are not that picky about where they stay. If you're looking for fancy room service, spa service, big pool etcetc- don't bother here.

We asked for a room higher up (as recommended through reviews) and were given a room on the 4th floor. Access to the strip was so quick and easy in comparison to hotels on the strip where you have to literally walk a mile to get to the street. Amenities included a mini fridge, a safety deposit box (which could be accessed via digits of your choice or by credit card), a coffee maker, and a hairdryer. One item that we needed that was not initially in the room was an iron and ironing board, but when we requested one it was brought to our room within 5 minutes. You definitely won\u2019t get service that quick at any of the monster strip hotels. The stay was quiet except for situations out of the control of the hotel such as the clock tower at the Venetian, the Mirage volcano until midnight and the crazy drunken hallway antics.

Fortunately, we were able to have spent the first night of a 4 day stay in the Hard Rock Cafe, which I would fully recommend to anyone. But let's get about the Casino Royale. To put the positive before the negative, I will have to say that the location is ideal (which is probably the reason this place stays in business). It's centrally located on the strip, and fairly accessible to just about anywhere you'd like to go. In addition to this, the casino itself is fairly compact, but fun (if you're in to low-rent, down to earth, friendly dealer..etc). Blackjack switch is a fun game, that improves your odds slightly, but costs considerably higher to play (because you're forced to play two hands instead of one) Now the negative. I'll list them numerically so as to be sure I capture them all. 1) The Smell: The entire place smells of urine and smoke. And the ventilation is HORRIBLE. The AC did not work (I read about this in a different review as well, so evidently it's commonplace at this hotel) 2) The Accomodations: The beds were uncomfortable, the rooms were dank and musty, the bathroom fixtures (namely the shower head) were coming out of the wall, and the rooms were dirty as ever...in fact, we found several long, black hairs in the shower that were evidently overlooked in the last \"cleaning\" 3) The Noise: Some construction was occurring in the parking lot behind us, and as much as I like the sound of clanging wood and metal in the morning, I did grow rather tired of the [--] rock radio station that was playing. 4) The Accessibility: I know - a contradiction to my previous statement about the location...but I'm talking ACCESSIBILITY. This place is so difficult to turn in to, that a few cab drivers even refused to pick us up when they discovered our destination. I'm not kidding, it takes a $4-5 cab fare just to make the right turn from a block away. Once you get in the door, it's even more difficult to get to your room...the hallways are extremely long, and when we were there, one of the elevators was out of service. In short, we had to pass through a clear glass door (that wouldn't open half the time, no matter how many times you swiped your card), up one flight of stairs, down a long smelly hallway, into the elevator, up two floors, back down the smelly hallway and into your room. UGH 5) We found so many things wrong with this place, and were so outright DISGUSTED by the hotel in general, that we humorously named the place \"The Bosnian Goat Ranch\" after staying there for one night, and commonly referred to it as such for the remainder of our stay.

Before the Love show, they waited 5 minutes for an elevator and then had to walk a mile to the casino. By staying here, you save hundreds but are closer to the action then at the other hotels. The only difference is the pool, but you can easily go to other casinos pools. We went to the Flamingos twice. We carried a back pack and everything. The casino is great. You get a two free ice creams at Ben and Jerrys for signing up for their club and their drinks are strong. The waitresses are quick to bring them too. $1 michalobs are perfect for getting the night started.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.C.", "Title": "\u201cGive Casino Royale a Chance\u201d", "Author": "bogddown", "ReviewID": "UR6182651", "Content": "Just got back from a trip last weekend that included a stay at the Casino Royale. While the hotel/casino is definately not the shining star on the strip, it does have several pluses that make it worth a look. Probably the best thing to say about the Casino Royale is its location. The hotel is smack dab in the middle of the strip, and is directly across from Caesar's Palace. Free parking in back with a 5 story garage makes the hotel really accessible. The price is another plus. Where else can you get a hotel room on the strip for under $100? The rooms are comparable to any standard hotel (i.e. La Quinta, Best Western, Holiday Inn) and are clean and roomy. Access to the hotel is by room key only, adding to an overall secure feel. While the rooms might not be swanky, lets be honest with ourselves. How much time do you actually plan on spending in your room while in Vegas? The hotel has an Outback and a Denny's, which is perfect in the morning to ease last night's hangover. The cons all come from your expectations. If you want a bunch of fluff, Casino Royale is definately not for you. The dealers in the casino are not the friendliest, and the hotel doesn't offer the amenities of others on the strip. If you are looking for a safe, clean, and reasonalby priced hotel in the middle of the strip, try Casino Royale.

The hotel was super clean, and you couldn't ask for a better location. The negatives were the room was really small, the bathroom was tiny, and the hotel offered nothing to make you want to spend any time at the hotel. The hotel (or I should say Motel) appears to be quite old and doesn't offer any of the modern touches you look for when deciding where to stay. The room rate ($85.00/night on Fri. & Sat.) was very reasonable compared to the $275.00 to $450.00 nightly weekend rate at the rest of the hotels on the strip.

The hotel pool is smaller, but again big enough to swim laps and adequate space to get some sun. It is open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. One of the other great things about this hotel is the location. It's pretty much right smack dab in the middle of the strip.

My husband and I won $1500 playing video poker, luck of the draw of course but winning always gives me a favorable impression of a hotel.

The rooms were clean - better than I expected. We had constant problems with our room keys, however. Also, I have been charged more than I was promised by the timeshare company, and the free slot machine play they offer must be done only on their \"promotional machines,\" on which you can not cash out unless you hit a jackpot. One employee told us that they had only seen two winners on these machines the entire time they worked there. These are also the machines that you must play when you join their \"club\" and get $50 free play. In addition, other offers that the timeshare company promised were not as they were explained to me. Overall, the rooms are fine and a good deal . . . DO NOT book there because you get a \"good deal\" from Tahiti Village . . . this is a waste of time and is not a good deal - except for the room discount (which I have not yet recieved), the extra stuff they offer is not worth it.
