The risk that you run by doing so is that you start expecting something truly marvellous and it can only disappoint. Let me start by saying that most of the staff are indeed very friendly but it is hit and miss. Some of them speak hardly any English, which can be difficult indeed, especially when your room isn't satisfactory for particular reasons. Another example is that I asked for assistance with an airport transfer to and from Fiumicino the day after I landed. I gave the receptionist the details (a one-day trip to Cagliari) but I was only given a taxi to Fiumicino. There was no one picking me up on my return. More frustrating was the fact that my room was simply not satisfactory, as mentioned before. Only two lights were working on about 25 watts and this did not exactly light up my room. I arrived late and my room was dark, also owing to the fact that the shutters were shut. Normally this is no problem but because the room was so dark, I could not find the switch to operate the shutters (yes, I felt like there was a hidden camera somewhere as I was 'feeling' all the walls for clues). To add insult to injury the shower hook was broken, which meant I had to hold it in a funny angle to get wet, causing the stream to turn into a drip. In the morning I tried to raise the issues with the night clerk but he spoke no English whatsoever and I knew that nothing was making sense, so I hoped that the cleaners might spot the darkness. They did not and I took another two rounds to reception that evening to get things sorted. When I came back from my dinner, around eleven thirty, I could happily report that most items were fixed and found (in case of the shutter switch - next to the bed duh). The shower is still an issue because it hangs at such an angle that you cannot flood the whole of your bathroom and every bathroom beneath you. As I mentioned, throughout all of this the staff were really friendly and not necessarily unhelpful by choice, just unhelpful by default. I was offered not to pay tourist tax. They didn't say why but I suppose it was because of the issues with the room. Sad to say, I probably would not recommend this hotel, purely on the basis that people who only stay a short time and have genuinely little time to spend, there were too many issues to get resolved just in order to get a good night's sleep.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201c3 Nights in Rome\u201d", "Author": "SteveS19046", "ReviewID": "UR126436608", "Content": "Traveling as part of a small group (8) we spent 3 nights in this centrally located boutique hotel near the Termini transportation center.

There is an encloseable outdoor area with tables that provided a wonderful place for our group to meet and discuss the day over a glass of wine before embarking on dinner plans. The hotel is clean, towels generous and staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast was included daily and again was very nice and typical for Euro-style breakfast- not lavish but generally heathy and very tasty. My only complaint was that the refrigerator (mini-bar?) was not cold and even after attention by staff never worked. There also was a bit of late noise- not partiers but workers doing something a few doors down at very late hours.

(Although... the cleaning staff seemed to think we needed fresh air and kept leaving the windows open.) MOST of the staff are helpful and pleasant. There is free wifi, when it is working. The rooms were in fact pleasantly large for a boutique hotel, BUT they could have done with an extra outlet and a little more storage. (A coat hook or two would have been nice.) But... by far the greatest failing was the bathroom. First... we stayed for 7 nights and had to request toilet paper 6 of those days. (I'm glad I always travel with a roll or two... at least to save a little space and for emergencies or packing material.) I never understood them, leaving the toilet paper holder empty. Bizarre. But the bathroom in general was terrible. The shower was LITERALLY... a 2x2-ft space... glass sides... with no place to put your soap or bottles. (And at 6'2\", I couldn't even put my shampoo on the floor of the shower as I could not then reach it.) If you wished to stand in front of the sink, you could either stand in the toilet or you could stand between them... with your calves pressed against the toilet and your thighs against the sink. Oh... but the bidet seemed to have plenty of space. And before you think they needed space for the door to open into the room (no... it didn't open out either), it was a pocket door. Worst bathroom layout ever. The room was not particularly quiet as we were not far from Nazionale (a very busy thoroughfare) and over a restaurant/bar that seemed to generate a loud crowd around midnight. I was surprised though... the bed was not as hard as is usual for Europe. Lastly... the hotel is fantastically placed. A 2-3 minute walk to Republica puts you on the most useful of the subway lines for tourism. Termini - the central train station - is only one stop away and lets you change to the other line useful for tourists. And, the noisy-customer-generating-restaurant below is quite good and reasonable... another bonus of the site.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cSnowy Rome\u201d", "Author": "Sid666", "ReviewID": "UR124750790", "Content": "Picked the first time in 26 years to coincide with first snow in Rome and did it, two blizzards in two days.

This was much much nicer. The room didn't overlook the street and was on the floor above the reception and dining room so it was much quiter. For the price we paid I thought it was excellent value for money. It was conviently located near Republica so easy walking distance from Termini. It was about a 10 minute walk to the Trevi area and about the same down to the Roman Forum area. I quite like to have a wander around so this location was great for us, but if you prefer to stay right in the central areas and not have to walk anywhere then maybe look elsewhere, but I doubt you will find anything any better value for money in Rome. A couple of other helpful tips. 1) the breakfast coffee was excellent, definitely one of the best in Rome! 2) If you want to eat closer to the hotel then I would recommend 'Al Viminale' (Piazza del Viminale, 3, Rome, Italy).

The entrance is used by othe \"chains\" of hoteliers too and can be found at the top of the street looking towards the Republica and away from the city, it will be on your right. Once found and squeezed into the oldest (but quaint) lift in the world, Bellesuites Reception can be found on the 2nd Floor. Check-in was fine and we were shown to our room on the 3rd floor. I have not seen a room key ie a metal thing in years! But thats what you get. Anyway the room had a large double (2 singles together but hardly noticeable) bed and single bed(?). It had hanging space, drawers, TV with Sky (Italian style), mini bar/fridge, phone, electronic safe and hair drier (the smallest ever). It did not have a kettle/tea/coffe, radio (tho MTV available on TV). The bathroom was amazing......no I mean amazing by its weird design! Floor space was not an issue but its use was. Bidet, Toilet, ridiculously large sink (so big you could hardly fit between it and the toilet) a tiny shower and no bath. I have heard that bathrooms in Italy can be small and this came in that bracket quite comfortably! Did it all work? Bidet-unused (tho may have faired better in there than the shower!), Toilet-no issue, Sink-ages to drain and Shower-pure rubbish. Shower head flopped on last but one day smashing soap dish and would never maintain its desired position again. Reported this to no avail...but we were leaving the next day! Several time the water pressure (hot) was very poor. So in all, yes we remained clean, but it was a struggle and the bathroom was the worst I'd seen in many a year. Dated does not come close. The location of the hotel is great for gettin about. 10 minutes walk (15 with cases!) to the main Termin Train station. Less than 5 minutes to the nearest Metro station at Republica on the A Line (the one that goes to all the tourist spots). If you don't mind the walking, about 20 mins to Trevi Fountain, Coloseum, 30 to Pantheon and 1hr to St Pieter's. But the Termini area is not the best so do not venture past there, otherwise the area around the hotel is ok. No names but do not fall into the trap of recommends for restaurants. We think we did, we paid 90 Euros for an avearage meal of 2 course each +1 bottle of wine! Other nights were around 60 Euros. Babbo's was the best meal, tho Life ran it close! Just be aware of hidden charges. Breakfast was ok, nothing brilliant but something for everyone. The staff were always corteous and helpfull. Their best advice being how to return to Ciampino Airport. Use the Terravision Coach service, 8 Euros each, taxi would be 32-45 Euros, metro/train or train/bus cheaper but you have to change. So a great location, pleasent & helpfull staff, noisey room (but I think just about every room in Rome has to be that!), awful bathroom but comfy bed in a clean room.

They did offer a car service for 60 euros that picked us up from the airport. The check in desk is on the 2 second floor (actually 3 floor up) and there is a old style lift however only 2 people can fit or 1 person with luggage. The room we stayed in was on the 3 floor (or 4 floors up). I was very disappointed that this hotel did not offer wifi service but offered a computer that seemed to be always used. Our room was large for a European sized room. The air conditioner hardly worked. It was at the lowest setting possible and it did not cool down the room even with the shutters closed and the drapes drawn. This was most unpleasant since the temperatures outside were quite high and we need a place to cool down. When you can't even go into your room to cool down there is a problem. The 2nd floor reception area was cool and the air conditioner here seemed to work just fine (of course this is where the front desk clerk stayed). The towels in the bathroom were very thin and thread bare. On our last night we had to call down because housekeeping only left 1 bath towel for two of us. The lights in the room were also horrible. It was impossible to read anything with the lighting provided. I usually had to go into the bathroom with a maginfying glass to read a map, this was consistent throughout the hotel. They must be using energy efficient bulbs that kept everything extremely dark. The bed was very low to the ground and we usually woke up with back pains from the mattress. The helpfulness of the front desk was spotty. There was one outstanding clerk who was extremely helpful in helping us find the right bus to get to our destination. The rest of the clerks usually gave us one word answers, this could have been a language problem but this particular clerk was not very friendly at all. The breakfast provided by the hotel consisted of pizza, some thin ham, lots of sweet pasteries and yougurt. There was very little protein available. Only on one day was there someone there to make coffee. usually we had to ask the front desk clerk who was very slow and usually finished the coffee when our breakfast was already finished.

My finance and I arrived in Rome via the train from Termini station and attempted to walk with luggage to Via Modena, because it didn\u2019t look too far on the map. The distance wasn\u2019t the issue\u2014it was just disorienting to emerge in this busy busting city where the street names are only visible on the sides of buildings. I recommend you take a cab! On the walk, it began to POUR! We were soaked and lost, but we finally arrived at the Hotel Adler and were greeted by the nicest concierge ever (he spoke great English, too). We told him our story and that we were a newly engaged couple (my finance proposed in Florence at the top of the Duomo!) and he upgraded us to the Bellesuite Roma, which was located on a different floor of the same building at 5 Via Modena. What a pleasant surprise! Our room was cozy but beautiful. We had very high ceilings with beautiful molding and large window that looked out on the street. The window had a metal shutter that you could slide down at night to dampen noise from the street, but Via Modena is fairly quiet and we didn\u2019t have any problems sleeping. The hotel is a little louder at night from internal noises because the old construction lets you hear a door shut across the hall, for example. The parquet floors and marble in bathroom were also nice additions. Size-wise, I found the room to be much better laid out and bigger-feeling that any hotel room I\u2019ve stayed in Europe before. The furniture was arranged in a way to make it feel more spacious, and the high ceiling contributed to the comfortable feel. The bathroom was small, as you\u2019d expect in any European hotel room, but there was a full tub which was a nice addition. The shower setup was kind of uncomfortable\u2014the shower head was one of the detachable kinds on a hose which isn\u2019t my favorite for taking a relaxing shower. The amenities were great: good hairdryer (it was in the desk drawer), SKY satellite TV with plenty of music and English channels, in-room safe, a full length mirror, and a side table and chair (rare in tiny hotel rooms!) The business center is also on this floor\u2014beware of the spring breakers on Facebook, though. We had to wait quite a while to get on the computer access of people checking Facebook. I can\u2019t complain though\u2014free internet access is a nice treat. The bed was a king made of two pushed together twin mattresses, and there weren\u2019t any extra pillows. The breakfast is nothing special (cold, dry, croissants, and weak coffee in a tiny room). I am glad we didn\u2019t pay extra for this and I don\u2019t recommend other travelers do either. The location is fine, but it\u2019s a bit of a walk to the historic center down Via Nazionale. This street is big and brightly lit: it felt very safe even when we walked down it at night. I would have probably liked to be closer in to the center, but this hotel was such a deal that the walk was a small price to pay. There is a McDonalds on the corner with Via Nazionale which is great for a midnight snack if you\u2019re too exhausted to search for a cultural experience! Overall, I totally recommend this hotel. We always felt safe and comfortable here, the staff is friendly, and it was a wonderful respite from hectic days in Rome.

Our room (we stayed in Room 301) was nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was not huge (it's Europe, after all), but was attractive and in great condition. We enjoyed breakfast on the terrace each morning and found it to be just the right way to start the day. The free internet station in the hallway was a great convenience that we used several times. What really set Bellesuite apart however was the helpfulness of the staff and the sense that people really cared about our comfort. Alessandro, Bruno, Martin, and all the staff were very accommodating - particularly in suggesting restaurants and making reservations. We found Bellesuite to be very good value, and hope to return soon to stay there again.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and the best service\u201d", "Author": "MarilynM", "ReviewID": "UR42622671", "Content": "Access to public transportation excellent.

The windows didn't shut, so it was very noisy\u2026 not at all what we requested. There were also tons of mosquitoes in the room, the sink didn't drain in the bathroom, and the shower was broken. Please see my attached pictures. We asked for another room, but the only other available room was directly next door, where the windows shut just as poorly as the first room. Finally, after hours of complaining, they put us into a new room that was on the inside of the building, but in a totally different hotel completely (the Adler Hotel), which is just one floor below the Bellesuite. This room was very small and barely could fit the bed in the room with more than 2 feet to walk in around two sides of the bed. There was a small wardrobe with no safe (nor was there a hotel safe), no deadbolts on the door, and more mosquitoes. We got ready for bed and found the only trashcan in the room did not open and the bed was actually two beds of different heights pushed together. AND there were holes in the sheets. After one night, we knew we couldn't stay there any longer, so they said they would give us a refund and then we found a nice new hotel. However, our travel agent who booked this hotel for us emailed them NINE times. They claimed our credit card would not accept their refund attempts. Our credit card company had no records of this occurring. At one point, the Bellesuite management asked us for our personal bank account number so they could directly put the money into our account. That is just asking for identity theft to occur. We had to open a new bank account to get the money bank. In the end, it took them TWO MONTHS to get us our refund.

The hotel is accessed off a side street 1 block away from the repubblica station, and is within walking distance (though we did not walk it) from the main Termini station. The front desk clerks are very helpful and friendly, they brought us and our bags up to the room and showed us all the amenities (refrigerator with room for things of your own-hit the grocery 4 blocks down Nazionale for drinks and snacks). The bed was comfortable, but not great. Bathroom was clean and stylish, the furniture was modern- dark wood and an LCD TV with DVD player and Sky digital cable box. AC/Heat worked perfectly and we were never too warm or cold. There is a metal blind that keeps out all light, so beware of sleeping really late if you keep it down at night. Breakfast is included and there is a nice spread including pastries, cereal, danishes, and yogurt with juices, regular coffee and some excellent cappuccinos that they will make for you. One morning my wife slept late and I hustled down to get breakfast before 10 (it's served from 7-10). The gentleman working asked where my wife was and then put a tray together for her with food and a cappucino for me to take back up. Location is very good, you are 1 block from the Repubblica stop and a 10-15 minute walk from the Colisseum/Forum, as well as the same distance from the Trevi fountain. If you want to eat at the Target restaurant downstairs (not affiliated with Belle Suites), I recommend making a reservation. We did not, and consequently were taken downstairs to their \"second\" dining room (in the basement) which paled in comparison to the elegant main room. We got up and left.

It's in a convenient location for all the sights and the railway station, and, being close to the Italian Government's offices, free of the graffitti that plagues much of the city.

I tried booking through Venere.com, but they could not accommodate us for Sept 19 - 21. I found Bellesuite's website, and via email correspondence, booked a double room. As directed, I called with Credit Card information. After arriving from airport via train, we walked to hotel, map in hand. What a wonderful surprise. The hotel is located in an excellent central location. We were tired, having flown from San Franciso, CA. We took the small cage elevator, it comfortably accommodated two adults with small rolling suitcases. Alessandro greeted us upon arrival, showed us to our room, assisting with our luggage. Our eyes lit up as we passed a small area with computer and Alessandro pointed out the free internet, telling us the password to sign in. Our room was wonderful, updated and clean. The breakfast, your basic continental style was okay, not outstanding, but comparable to the other two hotels we stayed. The highlight the first morning was ordering cappuccinos. I absolutely love cappuccinos and would sit, writing in my journal, enjoying two every morning. Three women staying across the hall from us invited us to share their private tour of the Vatican which Alessandro had arranged. We split the cost 180 Euros. Our tour guide was Michele Agostino. We skipped the lines, entered through a side door, with Michele knowing everyone. Michele is very knowledgeable and after the tour, we all agreed it was the best tour we had ever experienced. We agreed it was worth the extra cost. Alessandro split the cost for us, adding it to our individual bills. All we had to do was pay when checking out. I inquired as to how to book 1st Class reservations for the train to Florence. Alessandro said he would take care of it. When we checked out our Train Ticket was waiting for us and had been added to our hotel bill. What service! No worries, Alessandro took care of us. (Our hotel in Florence would not book our train reservations to Venice, requiring us to purchase in person) I checked my email while in Florence and found an email awaiting me from Alessandro and staff at BelleSuite thanking me for choosing them. I will definitely stay at the BelleSuite on my next trip to Rome. The rooms were clean, outstanding, with our window facing a quiet side street. We were not bothered by noise. Location and Customer Service was A+. After visiting the Borghese Museum, we took a cab. The driver looked puzzled when I told her the Hotel and street names. I had my map and showed the cab driver where the hotel was on the map. While she drove, I sat in front directing her! We laughed about it later.

We were very pleased---the location was convenient to the Metro, buses, and taxi stand at the Piazza della Republica.....bearing in mind that unlike us spoiled Americans, Europeans think nothing of having to walk 5 minutes! It was spotlessly clean, and the rooms are exceptionally large for a city hotel--we had a king-sized bed and they could've fit 3 more in there. The bathroom is very tiny, though. We loved opening our windows out over the street (Via Torino) and leaning out to enjoy the passing foot, scooter, and car traffic at any time of the day or night...but if you have a low tolerance for city noise, either ask for their quietest room or stay somewhere else! With the windows down and the shutters closed, there is little noise at night, but it is still audible if you're a light sleeper. We stayed in room 304. As everyone else mentioned, the staff is wonderful. The breakfast is very basic--be sure to ask for a capuccino, though, and they'll gladly make it. You won't find a nicer staff in any city--so don't let language fears put you off here. We liked the little birdcage elevator! A little tight when you're first arriving or leaving, but hey, it's got charm. If you go, up on the Piazza della Republica, there are 2 crescent shaped buildings that cover 1/4 each of the outer ring of the piazza. Walking up from the hotel, there is a luxury hotel in the right-hand side, and several shops including a pharmacy on the left hand curve. There is a cafe near the middle that has tables that look out toward the beautiful Naiad fountain....had a fantastic little vanilla milkshake there one afternoon, but we also stopped in for an aperitif, which was good, and even had a light breakfast there one morning. The place is not fancy or cheap, but my other half says their scrambled eggs were the best he's ever eaten! Also a good place to pick up an english-language newspaper if you like....there's a newsstand right nearby. We liked the International Herald-Tribune. Anyway, if you're looking for a little outside place to have a drink right in the neighborhood and with a good view, go take a seat and a waiter will be with you when he gets a minute. Catch your breath and marvel at the rush of Roman life, then pop into the basilica across from you and get a glimpse of the size of the old Roman baths. Betcha traffic wasn't any lighter 2000 years ago! IMPORTANT NOTE! Via Modena is not a large street and cab drivers will typically not know where it is---unless your Italian is good, a better bet is to tell them \"Piazza della Republica, per favore\", then just walk the few minutes back to the hotel. I STRONGLY SUGGEST that anyone going to Rome factor in at least 20 euros a day for cab fare. Yes, there are buses and the metro running, but boy, it can be a real boost to your flagging energy levels to sometimes just grab a cab and relax while someone else negotiates the crowds! Probably the best money we spent in Rome was on cabs.....after a long day of sightseeing, what a wonderful luxury to spend 10 euros getting home in comfort. Just resting your feet for that 10-15 minutes gave you time to get your second wind! Besides, it's a thrill ride and the scenery is unbeatable.

Not many cab drivers knew of the Bellesuite, I almost always had to ask for via Modena. The Bellesuite is not the only hotel in that building, there are a number of establishments that may, or may not belong to the same owner. Access to the Bellesuite is via a few flights of stairs, or a rather rickety old elevator, (3 persons max). Our room looked out on to the via Torino, near the intersection with the via Nazionale and the traffic noise was quite loud. We are city people, so are used to it but it needs bearing in mind. The breakfasts are also typically Italian hotel standard with barely drinkable \u2018regular\u2019 coffee, undrinkable juice and disappointing pastries.

As others have mentioned, while a little tricky to find and not much to look at from the outside, the staff and rooms make for a fine stay. The hotel is well located near a metro stop, but not so near the stop that the Davinci Express from Fuimincino arrives at that one would want to walk with luggage. We took a cab, which ran about 15E. It is a little confusing when you first arrive, as the same bulding has Bellesuite, Alder, Target Inn and an apartment area all though the same main entrance. The staff took very good care of us and the room was very nice. It was good to have the free internet access available. Also, breakfast on-site on the patio was very good. Just as an example of Allosandro's excellent service, after we got to Venice my wife realized that she left a sweater at a Pizzaria near the Bellesuite. I had paid with a credit card, so I had the name of the place. I emailed Allosandro at the hotel for help. I got a reply the same day that said that they had contacted the pizzaria, retrieved the sweater, and by what means did we need it sent to us. Above and beyond the call of duty. Also I would add a quick note about Angel Tours. We did the Vatican Tour one day and the Colloseum/Forum tour the next. Both days we had Ross as our tour guide. Both were well worth the 25E/pp. I am not sure how much of a line we skipped at the Vatican, as we still had to go through security, we definately walked past a long line to get into the Colloseaum as Ross had us buy our entrance tickets at an out of the way ticket booth during our walk around the Forum area. Probably saved an hour in line. Ross mentioned that the tours that charge by the hour don't seem to \"know\" about this other ticket booth.", "Date": "August 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbernauld, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cPound for pound - the best value hotel in Italy!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Jigsawman", "ReviewID": "UR5602528", "Content": "I have recently returned from my second stay at the Bellesuite, where once again I was impressed with the standards that are being maintained.

We wanted a hotel that was \u201cRome\u201d in character, was well located in terms of safety and walking distance to most attractions and public transport, was reasonably priced by Rome standards, yet had most of the amenities we North Americans take for granted in our hotels. A tall order\u2026 BelleSuite delivered. (Don\u2019t be put off by the street and exterior when you first arrive, or the elevator. It\u2019s Rome!) Unlike a previous reviewer, we booked online through Venere, and they were prompt and helpful with their replies. Double standard room was 150 Euros a night. Cancellation policy was 3 days before arrival without charge. We stayed at BelleSuite for three nights in mid-May, wanting to see as much of Rome as we could before taking a Mediterranean Cruise. We arrived around 1:00 p.m., quite tired after our Trans-Atlantic flight, and very relieved to learn that our room was ready. Our room (303), though smallish, was spotlessly clean with high ceilings and modern decor, a fair-sized bathroom with tub/shower combination, flat-screen TV, electric blinds, remote controlled air-conditioning (which worked!), and a comfortable bed. Noise was not a problem, as this room faced the back, across from the terrace where we had breakfast. As for breakfast, it was more than adequate: a generous continental breakfast with choice of coffee; we had cappuccino. The terrace was a lovely setting, and an opportunity to meet some interesting people. We also took advantage of the free Internet service every day. (Quite a deal, compared to the .75 cents a minute on our cruise.) As other reviewers have mentioned, the staff was friendly and very helpful. We\u2019ve really appreciated the hints that previous reviewers have shared, so here are ours: 1) For an inexpensive overview tour of Rome, take the #110 open top red bus, but be prepared to stand in line for tickets at the Termini. We took the hop-on hop-off option for 13 Euros, but getting back on the bus sometimes took too much time. In hindsight, we\u2019d do the less expensive (8 or 9 Euros, I think) 90 minute tour where you stay on the bus, and can work your way to the top of the bus as people exit. This narrated tour using earphones is sketchy but adequate, especially if you carry a guidebook such as Rick Steves\u2019. 2) Agree with previous reviewer that the Target restaurant just around the corner is very good, better than some of the hotel\u2019s recommendations. (You may want to check menus to see if there is a charge for bread. On our first evening we had a wonderful pasta dinner near the Spanish Steps, but were surprised to see a charge of 3 Euros for a very limited bread basket which we had assumed was included with the meal.) 3) Be prepared to get lost. Some of the narrow side streets aren\u2019t noticeably named, especially around the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps, so your map doesn\u2019t always help. Fortunately, there are always people around you, many of them carrying maps and as lost as you. We\u2019d definitely stay at the BelleSuite again. And this time, we\u2019d use the elevator, which looked archaic, but as we learned on our last day, was actually quite user-friendly.", "Date": "June 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cMy apprehensiveness melted away as soon as we arrived! Great Place!\u201d", "Author": "mlcurrie", "ReviewID": "UR5190991", "Content": "When researching hotels for our trip to Italy, I was addicted to Tripadvisor. That is exactly how I found Bellesuite in Rome and my other hotels. After booking Bellesuite, I became VERY apprehensive because I began seeing some not so positive comments. However, we had the BEST experience while travelling in Rome at the Bellesuite. Some things to note: 1. Be aware that when you make a reservation at Bellesuite through their website and have to cancel your reservation at any time (even if it is one hour after you made the reservation), there is a penalty of 1 night's fee. We did not have that problem, but that is something you should be aware of because I did not know that until after I booked the room. 2. After I booked the room through their website, I attempted to email the hotel on several occasions. All of my emails were returned to me as undeliverable. I am not sure what kind of trouble they have communicating with some email accounts. However, I emailed a person who had listed their email address on Tripadvisor and asked about contacting the hotel. The person actually emailed the hotel for me and the hotel emailed me within a day. After that, I had no troubles at all contacting the hotel. This is also something to be aware of when trying to email the hotel. It made me very nervous, but everything worked out perfectly! 3. When we arrived in Rome, we took the train from the airport to the Termini. Alessandro (hotel manager) had given me directions to the hotel from the train station and said it would take 5 minutes to walk. If we had known where exactly we were going and were familiar with the area, it would have only taken 5 minutes, but it actually took us over 20 minutes. The train from the airport comes in at the opposite end of the train station, so that added about 8-10 minutes to our walk. If you are planning to walk to the hotel (bags and all) from the train station, make sure you have already plotted it on a map that you are at the southernmost end of the train station when you arrive. **Since we arrived in the daytime, we had no trouble at all finding the hotel. Be aware that there is only a small sign noting where the hotel is, but it is easy to find. 4. Bruno greeted us at the front desk when we arrived and although his English is limited, he was wonderful to us! He was extremely friendly and made us feel welcome. We arrived early in the day (before 11 a.m.) and our room was already ready for us. Bruno helped carry our bags to the 3rd floor, as the reception area is on the 2nd floor. 5. We had a double room with a bathtub, room 303. Although the room was small, it is spotlessly clean and had everything we needed! The bathroom was better than I had imagined, considering the comments I had seen on this website. The bathtub was big enough for my husband and me--and we are not very small people. If you are a couple, this room will be perfect for you. 6. Breakfast--Again, I was skeptical about it after reading comments on Tripadvisor, but it was perfect for us. The staff was very hospitible and served us promptly. We ate on the breakfast terrace each morning and enjoyed it everyday. The breakfast is not what you typically have in the U.S. (with bacon, eggs, pancakes, etc.), but it was a feast compared to what I've had in Italy before for breakfast. 7. Concierage--WONDERFUL! Alessandro, Bruno, and Joyia (not sure about the spelling of her name) were so helpful to us. They booked train tickets to Florence for us and gave us any information we needed. 2 things that you need to make sure you know before you stay at Bellesuite: 1. My husband and I liked the Target restaurant that was right by the hotel, but we did not like the other restaurant recommendations from the hotel. Keep that in mind. 2. IF YOU ARE PAYING YOUR BILL WITH CASH, MAKE SURE TO HAVE THE EXACT CHANGE. They do not seem to keep change at the hotel, so we ran into a problem with paying because we needed 25 euros in change. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at Bellesuite! It was much better than I ever imagined it would be and we would stay there again!

The room had comfy bed, tv, sky, mini bar, electric curtains, shutters, marble bathroom, bath, shower. The room was cleaned every day spotless.

If you do go on the shuttle bus, make sure you allow a little more time to get to the airport on your return, we waited just over an hour because the coaches were busy and by the time we got to the airport we only had 45 minutes til take off.

Had no problem locating the hotel and we were not disappointed when shown to our room. Very modern and clean with DVD, satellite TV, flat screen TV and a large double bed. The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate. Location wise, the Bellesuite can't be faulted. We walked to the Colloseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Campo Fiori, Pizza Navona etc. There's also a Metro station nearby at Republica which we used to get across to St Peter's and the Vatican Museums. Located just off Via Nazionale there was not too much noise from the traffic but obviously anywhere in central Rome isn't going to be car horn free and we were disturbed on occasions. Not the end of the world though at all. All the staff that we came into contact with were very friendly and helpful. They were even able to point us in the direction of a bar showing English football (we arrived in the middle of FA Cup weekend!) The hotel has a free internet connection and a selection of guide books and also provides a really useful free map which we used extensively. We even arrived home to an e-mail from the hotel thanking us for our stay and hoping that we had enjoyed it. A nice little touch that you don't usually get. The only thing that lets this hotel down is the breakfast. It's served in a tiny room on the 2nd floor and if there are more than a couple of tables occupied it feels very cramped. The selection of food is also quite poor, even for a continental breakfast -cereal, bread, pastries and yoghurt was all there was on offer. The addition of some cold meats or cheeses would have improved this no end and may have resulted in an 'excellent' review rather than just 'above average'. We ate at the Target restaurant on the corner of via Modena and were very impressed. The service, food and wine were all fantastic and we thought it was excellent value for money. Highly recommended.

We checked in at the Hotel Adler desk which is on the second floor of the building, then we were taken up to the third floor, which is the Bellesuite. Breakfast is in a tiny room on the second floor and consists of cereals, croissants, cakes, juice etc.. very basic fare. All in all, a pleasant stay in what amounts to a business type hotel. If you are looking for a reasonably priced place for a couple of nights this place fits the bill, but dont be taken in by the romantic praises of some of the reviews otherwise you will be disappointed. General Tips - there is little in the way of nightlife in the vicinity of the hotel (bars etc..) best place is Flann O'Briens Irish Pub on the Via Nazzionale just round the corner from the Bellesuite. It is always busy with a nice mix of locals and tourists. It also serves good quality food throughout the day. If you are using a budget airline to Ciampino Airport, book your coach transfer to Termini on the Terravision website and walk it from the station to the hotel. When returning give yourself plenty of time to get back to the airport - coaches can get very full and the traffic in the morning can make the 30 minute journey to the airport much longer.

(The top rated Residence Cellini is on the same floor, but we have no way to evaluate that hotel.) Because of the Trip Advisor reviews and ratings, we booked a suite here for four days in February, 2006, through Venere which was what came up on our computer screen unexpectedly through, I believe, the Trip Advisor website, but I cannot be certain. In any case, when we arrived they had no record of our reservation! So, the kind lady behind the desk (who spoke excellent English) arranged for us instead to stay in a single room on part of the second floor, which is called Hotel Adler, just a floor below Belle Suite. Note that the reception area for both is now on the second floor; the third floor reception desk is now the free high speed internet access for both Hotel Adler and Belle Suite as well. Both the staff and we were pleased that there was a room available on such short notice, so no great harm done. However, surprise! Both these hotels are now operated under single management! So, we got a single room instead of a suite and paid 1/3 less! This was okay, but we never saw Belle Suite rooms and so cannot comment on them. However, we also discovered that the breakfast room for both Hotel Adler and Belle Suite were now the same second floor room. We will leave a review of Hotel Adler at that place on the Trip Advisor website. However, we should comment that the breakfast was really not very good. The food was not very fresh and we were not offered second servings of hot drinks. (we didn't ask, either) The juice was not very tasty and there was no cheese, or cold cuts, or eggs, etc. Just some croissants, granola, rolls and jam, milk, and such. Let me acknowledge that the staff went out of their way to assist us in many ways. For this reason I rate the hotel neutral instead of okay with some problems. I lost my wallet due to a pickpocket on the Metro (even though we are experienced in travel; WARNING--all it takes is a momentary lapse of caution) and the hotel allowed us to make several long calls back to the US to cancel credit cards, and charged us nothing! The reception attendant also called and reserved for us a time to see the Galleria Borghesi, like a great concierge would. Others have commented how poorly marked is the hotel building, and how central it is to Rome, but next time we stay at Villa San Pio for charm sake. Hint: Visit Ostia Antica which is a 1/2 hour train ride from the station next to the Pyramid Metro station. There is a great statuary museum and a sense of stillness and history quite different from the Forum or Colosseum. It requires a lot of walking, but is well marked in English and one of the highlights of greater Rome.", "Date": "February 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium, As", "Title": "\u201calmost perfect\u201d", "Author": "wimpiot", "ReviewID": "UR4446330", "Content": "good location near the station, near the via Nationale, correct room, shower a little bit too small for 1,89 meter, every-one very kind, but breakfast is very bad, at 9 o'clock no bread anymore, but i will return !!", "Date": "February 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff, UK", "Title": "\u201cExcellent choice\u201d", "Author": "Papofurado", "ReviewID": "UR4409902", "Content": "Weekend stay at the Bellesuite, chosen largely as a result of the positive postings on Tripadvisor.

It was great. Alessandro and his staff were most accommodating. He responded to my emails promptly when we were looking to book a room. (I didn't check anywhere else as the prior recommendations from TripAdvisor sold me on this hotel.) Cost was 100 Euro per night. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL AND WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN. Hotel: It is near the train station and easy to find. The train was 9.50 Euro from the airport and leaves every 30 minutes. The trip was about 25 minutes. From the station, it was about a 15-minute walk or so to get to BelleSuite. When leaving the train station, continue on the main level the entire way...it's smooth (marble and not cobble stone) and no 'vendors' asking if you want a ride. (we walked down the stairs and were 'hit on' right away.) At the front of the station, there are taxis waiting, if you choose to take one. We downloaded a map from this website. The hotel is located on the second floor. (Third in U.S. terms as their \u2018first\u2019 floor is our \u2018second\u2019 floor.) Our room was 203, on the second floor. It was very spacious. While the shower is small for U.S. standards, it is pretty normal for European bathrooms. My boyfriend is 6'4\" and had no problem...and, when in Rome... I used the elevator only to haul my luggage when we checked in/out. Otherwise, the 55 (or so) steps were good exercise. Breakfast was from 7:30-10:00 on the main floor. All the staff was most helpful with answering our questions and offering assistance. While one person spoke very little English, we had no problem communicating with the others. Location: We loved the location. We walked everywhere and never took a cab or Metro. They have a great map for your use (it's available at different locations in the city, too). Internet: free on third floor. Language: Most people spoke English. No problems anywhere. Money: Use your debit/check card. Much better exchange rate (by $.10). DON'T use Western Union...they charge a commission and rip you off. The vendors that say 'change' on the outside are reasonable, but the cost was $.10 more than using a debit card for money. Restaurants: Alessandro recommended Target, Cafe Rinaldi (can't remember remainder of name), and Pentolaccia. They were all excellent. We found Popi-Popi in Trastevere neighborhood to be excellent, too. Limoncello (a liqueur) was our dessert every night...mmm good. Sites: Did the usual sites -- churches, Colosseum, Palatino hill, Forum area, Pantheon, Tomb of Unknown Soldier, St. Peter's Basilica, Vatican, Sistine Chapel, Castle of St. Angelo, Piazza del Popolo, Spanish Steps (Scalinata Trinita dei Monti), Piazza Navona. Ended up attending mass at Santa Maria in Trastevere as we got there 15 minutes before. Stayed for a short time. Attended a choral concert at Santa Maria degli Angeli. Attended midnight Mass on Christmas Eve at St. Peter's Basilica. Didn't have a ticket (free) to be inside. Watched from outside on the Jumbo Tron. Got there at 9:00...could have waited until 11:00. However, if you get a ticket, get there around 6:00 or 7:00 to stand in line. The Basilica seats 7,000. Safety: We always felt safe, even when walking late at night. Wear comfortable shoes. I wore light hikers from Lands End with a Spenco insert. They worked great.

We stayed at the Bellesuite Rome for 3 nights over new years and enjoyed our time there. Alessandro and the rest of the staff were very helpful and welcoming, we had free internet access, maps, and the staff were happy to make reservations on our behalf. However the only negative point is that my parent\u2019s room was on the same floor as the reception and I shared with my sisters on the 3rd floor. The difference in the quality of the rooms is very noticeable and my parent\u2019s room had basic decor in terms of the room and bathroom, also there was no shower curtain. On the other hand my room had a flat screen TV, DVD player and was very comfortable and matched the photos on the hotel site. I cannot say if all rooms on 2nd floor were like this but I would advise requesting a room on the 3rd floor if you are staying here. (Unfortunately didn\u2019t take pics of the basic room) The other comment I would like to make is the basic choice of breakfast which was now in fact being served in a room on the second floor and not in the Target restaurant as previous visitors have experienced. If you like cereal and pastries this is OK, but not for those that like a hearty hot breakfast. Lastly we found the area to be perfectly safe with a good range of shops and restaurants around the corner of the hotel. All the sites are in walking distance (15-20mins to colosseum, capitoline museum, palatine hill, forum) and about 45mins to vatican city. It is a city centre to be walked and we did not have to take the cab or the metro anywhere. I would easily stay here again if I come to Rome. Final comments: - recommend at 10euros each is to ride the Time Elevator situated off via del corso, it will give you the history of Rome and the changes the city has gone through during a 45minute interactive ride. - check opening times of sites with hotel staff, they are frequently changed and will differ from travel guides as we found - queue early for colosseum and vatican museums, even in winter the amount of tourists that visit will mean long waits - none of the sights and very few shops are open for new years day. Restaurants on new years eve are either fully booked, have a set menu that is fairy costly or are closed, so book well in advance. - visit to the sistine chapel is a must and will blow you away even if you are not an art lover Rome is a fantastic city like no other and hope all that visit have a great time as we did.", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location, beautiful room\u201d", "Author": "JetSetJeny", "ReviewID": "UR4326987", "Content": "My fiance and I stayed here for 2 days.

This also meant I had to leave my fiance downstairs whilst I went up to find the suites as the level it is located on is not well marked from the front or in the lift and no-one came down to help us so we had to work it all out ourselves which did not give us a very good first impression. I like that the room has windows that open out for fresh air and the air con worked well, which was welcome as it was 30 degrees when we arrived. The staff don't speak very good English at all, not even basic English which made it a bit more difficult. Maybe we should learn more Italian for next time we're in Rome.

I couldn\ufffdt ask for anything more in a hotel.", "Date": "August 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable, quiet, cool and secure\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3706788", "Content": "We loved our stay at the Bellesuite Hotel! The bedroom was large, air conditioned and very clean. The bed was large and comfortable. TV with DVD player, small fridge and safe were all welcome amenities. The bathroom was spotless but very small. We had a room with a very small stand-up shower stall. If you are a larger person, be sure and ask for a room with the larger bathtub/shower combo or you may find yourself unable to get into the shower. The management and reception staff were exceptionally polite, friendly and helpful. The location was convenient to the Termini station and we were able to take long walks in the late evening to see the spectacularly lit fountains and monuments of Rome without feeling unsafe in the least. The breakfast is basic and is served at a corner bar near the hotel. We did not always find the serving staff at the bar very friendly, unfortunately. The reception staff was always willing to wake us up by bringing us tea or coffee to our room in the morning, if we requested and that was a very nice touch.", "Date": "July 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Williston Park, New York", "Title": "\u201cDon't Look any Further...this is the Place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "CuriousNYC", "ReviewID": "UR3644381", "Content": "We were originally very wary of the Belle Suite Rome because we heard so many bad things about hotels in near the train station. But do not worry...the Bellesuite is not in a bad location! The hotel has an elevator, where we were greeted by Alessandro, who helped us with our luggage. The rooms were great! Clean, roomy, air-conditioned...what more can I ask for? The room also had dvd player, a safe, and a refrigerator!) Alessandro made sure our stay was perfect...giving us great restaurant and gelateria recommendations. He also allowed us to use the hotels laptop to chack our mail....at no charge! We walked everywhere from our hotel...I have to admit...St. Peter's was a bit far.
