Located a only a couple of blocks from Roma Termini station, one could be a little confused as there is a board for Stargate Hotels on the building outside, once you enter the building you see the Hostel Termini sign. The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a few pointers and maps when we checked in. The rooms were clean and so were the bathrooms. I was expecting a leaking bathroom from the reviews I'd read earlier but seemed like everythng had been revamped and was new. One could skip the breakfast though which comprised of basic croissants, jam, butter, cereal and milk. Decent place to retire after a day of walking around Rome!", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cApartments attached to hotel termini\u201d", "Author": "Andy12389", "ReviewID": "UR104260810", "Content": "After reading many reviews concerning accommodation in Rome I can now say all rooms within all the hotels appear to be very clean but on the small side. This in itself is not a real issue as long as you use your accommodation purely as a place to rest after a busy day of site seeing. I personally did not find the noise from traffic an issue (we were staying on one of the main roads via Nationale), the only problem was the amount of apparently ill people in Rome with ambulances constantly charging around Rome with sirens continually blurring. I feel sorry for the drivers who must have to leave after a short period of driving due to hearing difficulties. For larger groups i.e. 4 or more hotel termini offers apartments located on via Nationale some distance from the actual hotel but the services of the hotel were never required during our stay. The location of the hotel and apartments are very good as all links are close by the Termini which is the main railway station in Rome (good for trips further a field), the metro and all buses seem to go down via Nationale at some point.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value Hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "PKB7", "ReviewID": "UR85062669", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in October and were really suprised with the hotel - it was well priced, clean and breakfast was included.

We booked a private three bedroomed room with ensuite and were extremely pleased;. the room even had a TV and a fridge. It is situated only four blocks from the Termini Station where you can get anywhere in Rome for 1 Euro, and it's only about a mile away from the Colloseum and Trevi Fountain if you want to walk. The only downside was the breakfast. I would not recommend paying for this as 3 Euros gets you just a croissant and roll with jam, and a selection of drinks. Coffee and tea were not great. You can easily walk down the road and get a beautiful panini for the same price. Overally though I would definately recommend the Termini. Although it seemed like if you booked a private room, you were seperate from the hostel part, so I cannot comment if it is vastly different if you stay in a dorm.", "Date": "June 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Channel Islands", "Title": "\u201cSuprising hotel near Station\u201d", "Author": "Jinxi", "ReviewID": "UR53294970", "Content": "In November 09 I went to Rome. I found this hotel online (you can only book it online) it is a satelite Hotel of the Piram which is on another street corner about 200m away. The hotel was 2 streets from Termini station. Hearing how \"dangerous\" Termini area was at night I was a little nervous. However, we did not walk to late at night and we did not find any problems. I could see if you stayed out late how you could be a candidate for a pickpocket. However this small hotel is very secure on the 3rd floor of a large building. It has many little restaurants within walking distance and a supermarket inside the station. Breakfast is included in the price. The rooms are meduim sized and clean. Our room was just beautifull and the beds were very comfortable. Could hardly hear any noise at night. Our breakfast was brought to our room every morning. Our lugage on the day of or departure was stored at the Piram hotel down the road. This was very convenient and we could enjoy our last day. I found the staff, even though their english was minimal very pleasant and helpful. All in all very positive experience It was very convenient to stay here - the Rome metro was very easy to use and within minutes you are at most of the historical sites. The hotel itself is close to Santa Maria Maggiore - which if you just arrive is a nice walk. We arranged for pick up at the airport and the driver was very good and arrived on time - however Rome is not for the faint hearted drivers. We thought of hiring a car. But after we say the way people drive we were glad we didn't. I think unless you are a Roman...you are best off not driving. Sights I enjoyed was the Vatican - however the museums are situated toward the left of St Peters Basilica and about a 1km walk around the place. Many \"tourguides\" try and con you by saying if you \"join\" their group they will take you around and the museum price in included. Some kiosks offer tours for 25 euro. Howeve we walked the distance and found that the entry is only 12 euro and we could hire an audio guide if we wanted. The Vatican museums are so extensive that one day is not enough. Just to take in the millions of treasures is too overwhelming. We found the same at the Coloseum. The price of visiting the coloseum includes the Forum, but again you have to walk all the way around and it is quite a walk. However still cheaper to stand in the queue. The people offering you a tour are all fake and best avoided. Most are very plausable, even some american students were trying their luck at scamming, it is not just locals. Once you are inside and near the entrance they say the \"tour ends\" you think you going into the site and then you see a vendor selling the \"official tickets\". The many small food shops and speciality shops are fantastic. The Via Condotti is also amazing even if it is the most expensive street in Rome, well worth a visit. I can't wait to go again. I have been 3 times and I never seem to see evreything.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Termini Accommodation", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d577480-Reviews-Termini_Accommodation-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Marghera No. 35, Int 9, III floor</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Viale Castro Pretorio 64</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "577480", "ImgURL": ""}}
