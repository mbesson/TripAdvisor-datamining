We paid the Euro6 extra to get aircon in our room, so we could keep windows closed besides our room was at the back of the building. We had a very comfortable night. It is small but, well situated. Stairs are wide and easy to negotiate. We had a vehicle and parking was easy and close in spite of the one ways.

The location - right in the center of the city - is incredible, and despite that - my room faced an inner courtyard and so it was very quiet.

I would rate it a good choice for couples or friends on city breaks to Madrid. Although it looks a bit seedy from the outside, it's well-lit, and very clean and comfortable on the inside. The rooms are tastefully decorated and spotless, if a little Spartan and small. The bed was comfortable if a little hard. The windows were heavily soundproofed, so we got a good night's sleep -- and just as well, since the street is very close to Puerta del Sol and thus very noisy.

Its right in the centre of Puerta del Sol, the heart of the city, near to Metro stop Sol. Surrounded by tons of eateries, bars, cafes and of course all attractions are walking distance away. Facilities: The room was quite small. Our twin bed room had 2 beds in a single line, so you can imagine the width of the room. The bathroom esp the shower cubicle was very small, but functional. Housekeeping was done daily and hotel was generally clean. You could borrow an iron if you need. Food: There is no room service but they have a Tijcal restaurant down on the street where you get a discount as a guest. Serves great pizzas. Anyhow, the street is lined with numerous cafes, so no problem. You can order breakfast (juice, coffee, crossiants) the night before and they will serve you in your room in the morning. Very reasonably priced. Also, there is a coffee vending machine at the reception. Downside: Its near a club. As Madrid parties all night, you can hear the vibrations of music in your room till wee hours and can have a sleepless night if you are a light sleeper. The club is closed on Sunday, so it is pretty peaceful on Sunday. Wouldn't mind going back for a short stay.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGood for the price\u201d", "Author": "moglin", "ReviewID": "UR18597866", "Content": "This hotel is excellently located - very central in Madrid.

Yes the room was small but big enough for 2 (we had a double) spending most of the day out anyway! There was a little bit of building noise but as long as the window was shut we could not hear it and it didn't seem to start till about half past nine in the morning anyway.

However, that is where my good comments end. This was a building site. There was half the floor dug up as soon as you set foot inside, with little or no boarding to attempt to make it safe, then rooms were still being built right next door to ours. The noise & dust was horrible. Also, the staff could do with some lessons in manners as they were very rude. They seemed to look for ways to argue with you & tried to charge us for things already paid for (breakfast was paid for but did not arrive & we were later told this was our fault even though we ordered it!) Also charge 5Euro per day for aircon which is not mentioned when booking & was also not available for most rooms due to the building work - they said they could not turn the electricity on as a result it was hot hot hot in those rooms! We eventually did get air-con but I know most rooms were still without it. Also, our friends were accused of flooding the hotel when they took a shower - the shower was not plumbed in properly by the look of it, but this was their fault apparently! All I can conclude is that this will be a clean travel-lodge style place in a good location once they finish building & staff have some lessons in customer relations.", "Date": "July 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK / Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean and cosy rooms\u201d", "Author": "hea27", "ReviewID": "UR7632053", "Content": "Location: great for Sol Metro station, theatre, shops and main attractions Reception: quick and easy Room: small but clean Breakfast: didn\u2019t purchase (3EUR p/p delivered to room)", "Date": "May 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heidelberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood value in central Madrid\u201d", "Author": "Tara38", "ReviewID": "UR6812773", "Content": "This is a prime location in Madrid- I feel lucky that we found it.

We had fresh sheets and towels everyday, there is also a tv in the room with a couple of english channels. We were in the room right next to the reception desk - which i was initially a little concerned about due to noise - didn't hear a thing! You have to pay a little more for the airconditioning but it is worth it especially in the summer! Everything is a short distance from this hotel and there are lots of bars and restaurants on the doorstep if you don't fancy venturing to far from the hotel but the city itself had oudles of restaurants to go to. The day that we left they were more than happy with us leaving our bags at the hotel as we went for a final day of sight seeing before we caught our train. The staff speak english too and are very helpful recommending various attractions to see. You have to be buzzed into the building at night (and sometimes during the day), the hotel is on the 2nd floor, but there is a lift.
