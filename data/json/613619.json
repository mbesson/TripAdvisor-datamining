I woke up the next morning to find that the sheets did not match the mattress so that I was actually laying on the mattress itself and that there was a white crusty area on it....., I went to take a shower and the water was only HOT no cold or luke warm straight hot the towel I was provided had black smudges on it and the window was cracked and broken making easy access to the room. The manager was nice and all but that motel is a portal to hell I do not recommend anyone to stay there except junkies, homeless and prostitute's", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cUse to come all the time but every room has bed bugs now not worth it!\u201d", "Author": "jay00000", "ReviewID": "UR120313636", "Content": "Use to come all the time but every room has bed bugs now not worth it!", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnetka, CA", "Title": "\u201cHelladise Inn & Suites\u201d", "Author": "VagrantSoul", "ReviewID": "UR117639569", "Content": "Ok, let me start from the beginning. I arrive 15 minutes late to my 1pm reservation. So why then did I have to wait 30 minutes for them to clean my room? And by clean I mean, wipe things down/off, and run the vac twice down the middle of the room. then I was able to walk in. Closing the front door to the room, was a task. Closing the bathroom door, was a mission. Since I'm on the hellish mission impossible bathroom...the room was so small I had to leave it to change my mind. The deathtrap of a shower had at best warm water. I had to leave it run for 30 minutes for hot. But once it was hot, it was hot! The window in the bathroom looked like one of those movie windows that a criminal staying over night would try to escape from. Which would have been easy since there was no screen on it. The bed was a king, but the headboard was a cal-king. which means it wasn't even attached to the bed! The sheets had burn stains on them, and there was no fitted bottom sheet. The Direct tv, had issues all night!. Every channel I tried to watch had static. The nicest touch to the room was the loveseat. And since the headboard wasn't attached you know the loveseat got over worked! Sadly, with all of that in the room, you barely had room for a table. Or at least THEY did. Not to mention that the fridge didn't work, and ice (which in most places is free) was 50 cents. And where was I gonna put on this soon to be water?!! Overall - if it weren't for the company, I would've packed up, cussed the guy in the front for having the nerve to call this place paradise anything, and left. Had I known there was a Rodeway Inn 5 minutes away, I would have gone there.

It looks a bit doubtful from the outside, and the room did not impress me when I first opened the door either. But I stayed here five nights and found it clean, comfortable, and quiet, with a good shower with plenty of hot water. Also, everything worked, including the wifi, TV, refrigerator, microwave, iron, drawers, and locks. The service is good and the management is friendly and helpful. Judging from the parking lot containing a large, black mercedes sedan and many expensive SUVs, quiet a few people who probably could afford a better looking place stayed here. My five-year-old Subaru was the oldest car in the lot. If you don't mind kind of funky, mish-mash decor, this motel should do you well. If a really nice location is a must, you'll probably want to look elsewhere. This motel is located south of Santa Monica in not the finest L.A. territory.

They also had some druggies rooming there to. i had some drunk guy invite me to his room and it was only 7 PM i had to call my husband to go outside with me.

The manager lives on site. We stayed a week, and had these problems: The microwave was half broken, at time firing and popping like it might explode. Also, the hot water leaves ALOT to be desired, so showers must be quick. Also, there is free wireless internet, but the cable only has a few channels. To name a few, CNN, FOX, basic channels, HBO and also a dedicated porn channel. I MEAN dedicated, as in non stop porno's 24 hours a day. At first we thought it was some kind of mistake or joke, but i guess not. It's quite strange...in fact, this may very well be the strangest hotel I've ever stayed in. At $325 a week ($60 a night) for a king-size room with a microwave and mini-fridge, it is moderatly priced for the city, but could offer a little more for the money, I think, as I've stayed at dozens of hotels for 45-55 a night and got a higher level of quality. However, like alot of weekly stay hotels, it's not filled with bums or druggies, and is quiet, so if your a drifter with a little cash in hand, this is a pretty good bet.
