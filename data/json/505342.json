{"Reviews": [{"Content": "lousy room the hotel was old and small. the worst thing was the room i got. i stayed in a twin room, room 21 and it was the smallest in the hotel. it was long and narrow and felt like we were living in a converted toilet. i think the other rooms were not so bad. we spent GBP90 for 2 nights. it has got to be the worst hotel room i stayed in so far. however, the hotel's location was good and the service was alright. i won't return if i have to stay in the same room again", "Date": "Mar 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR100694486", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Titus_Orion"}, {"Content": "- ok, safe, clean, nice staff, bit over prices This is a budget hotel. The decor is very old, and there is wear and tear (my room there was a damp related crack in the wall, but it was dry).The staff are very friendly and the place is kept very clean, no bugs or nasty surprices. The bed was comfy and there was a shower in my room as well as a TV (cnn was on it, if you like watching the same 2 non news stories every 10 min).The shared shower rooms and toilets were also clean if a bit rough. The shower curtain in the shared shower was not that clean and ripped.In the lobby type area you find free net/pc access, which was a huge bonus. The hotel is on two floors of an apartment building which is usual in italy. There is a lift. The whole place seems very secure. Breakfast would have cost 5euro and looked ok but not much for your money, there is a bar on the corner just outside and a good bakery on the way into the town.TIP: Avoid at ALL COSTS the restaurant next door. The food is ok ish but massivly over prices and tiny portions. Turn left out of the hotel, walk up and take the first or second left and there is a kebab shop which does amazing pizza to eat in or take away.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR134845061", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "gmfromnearlondon"}, {"Content": "Reasonable value for budget traveller Friend  I stayed in Tina's hotel from 2 June to 6 June 2006. We re-confirmed our booking 1 day before, but we didn't have a room upon arrival. Staffs didn't tell us the reason, just helped us finding another location to stay 1 night  compensated our cost on taxi  additional room rate for that night. It did make us very inconvenient expecially we needed to carry heavy luggage going up  down without elevator. On plus side, shared bathroom is old, but clean. Common room is decorated with dry-flowers. Room is tided up everyday. Breakfast is generous, expecially for a 1-star hotel. You can have fruit, croissant, yogurt, cereal...etc. Coffee is wonderful. If you have a tightened budget  don't want to stay in hostel, Tina hotel is value for money. Contrarily, if you can pay a little more to get away from old shared bathroom and dirty shower curtain, please consider somewhere else.", "Date": "Jun 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR246713142", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MBABB"}, {"Content": "Great affordable place with extremely friendly staff My girlfriend and I stayed at the Hotel Tina from December 22nd through Christmas of 2005. We expected to have shared bathrooms, but when we showed up we discovered there was a shower, sink, and a bedet (no toilet, however) right in our room. It was a little awkward but overall a nice thing to have. Our bed was big and comfortable, the TV had good reception and a few English channels, and there was plenty of space for our clothes and luggage.They have two other bathrooms. One has a weak toilet, and the other has a good-powered toilet along with a shower. The water pressure in that shower is a little shabby, however. This was no problem for us, since we had our own shower in our room, but I could see how it would be inconvenient for the other guests who weren't as fortunate as us.The staff is wonderful, extremely friendly and helpful. When we first arrived they gave us a map of Florence and pointed out all the tourist destinations and offered to help us as much as we needed. They were friendly to us every single day and made us feel right at home. Their English is good, and you will have no trouble communicating.For 5 dollars per person per night, you can get their breakfast, which is awesome and very big. You can have cereal, milk, coffee (including cappucino), croissants, rolls, fruit, yogurt, crackers, etc... I ate a ton every morning. Breakfast starts at 8:30, but my girlfriend and I were getting up very early. On two occasions the staff offered to start breakfast early for us and we gladly accepted the offer.Hotel Tina is extremely affordable and will make your stay in Florence really pleasant. If I return, I'd love to stay at Hotel Tina again. My only complaint was the bathroom situation, but this was completely offset by the staff and the atmosphere.", "Date": "Jan 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR237158869", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "PublickStews"}, {"Content": "Excelente ubicacion   showReview(21292873, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR187720356", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Generalbelisario"}, {"Content": "Es un hotel acogedor, el unico...   showReview(13397782, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 17, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR804338097", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "L'hotel Tina \u732b situato in...   showReview(12650209, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 27, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR851378390", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "H\u4e48tel tr\u732bs bien situ\u8305.
