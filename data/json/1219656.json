The taxi we took just dropped us at the first WOW hotel builidng and we had no idea the two buildings are off different hotels (both of them has WOW name on the top). The reception told us the airport hotel is next door so we had to carry our own luggages to other building at 1am. The room was ok but the air in the room was not. The windows couldn't open but there was no air con. The aircon control said 10 degree celsius but the temperature in the room must have been 40c, very hot, humid, stuffy and moldy. We only stayed for a few hours since our flight arrived around 1am and the next morning we flew out at 8am. The worst part of the hotel is its thin wall. We were woken up several times during our little hours of sleep (around 2-6am) by many phone wake up calls that rang right into your ears although they were other rooms' wake up calls. Imagining we only had 4 hours of sleep time but got woken up every hour by the phone ring. If you don't have a late arrival flight and early morning one to catch, I do not recommend the hotel.
