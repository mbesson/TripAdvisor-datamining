Disappointing lapses in service execution and value: e.g., meal entree in Gazebo restaurant served too long after preparation; as a result it was tired, not fresh (crisp items not crisp, sauce separated, meal lukewarm, not hot; wine served not the one ordered. Very expensive ancillaries: 12 dollar (20TKL) unaccompanied cup of coffee, 67-dollar (120TKL!) standard (even if excellent) buffet breakfast, expensive informal restaurant (Gazebo)with limited choices (but beautiful views). We are used to staying at luxury hotels and don't expect bargains, but this pushes the envelope almost to the point of insult. The prices may explain why the hotel website does not include menus for its restaurants. Unacceptable: at checkout desk clerk said that he would remove erroneous minibar charge and didn't; separately was charged 18TKL for verbally reported last-night item that was listed on the minibar menu at 8TKL (and not inexpensive at that price). Perhaps I should have reviewed bill more carefully (I was in a bit of a hurry at checkout), but not correcting reported errors acknowledged while I was in the checkout process and dramatically overcharging, even if unintentional, is unacceptable and should not occur anywhere, let alone at a hotel of this class. We expect to pay for luxury, but we expect value and nearly perfect service.

It is luxurious; has excellent service; enjoys a beautiful setting on the Bosphorous ; and delivers a high end experience. However we found its location had limitations. The only other 'hospitality facility' nearby is the Four Seasons Hotel; to reach relaxed bars and non-hotel dining opportunities always necessitated a taxi ride , bus or tram journey. Instead of capitalising on the opportunty this created, by delivering attractive solutions on property, the hotel was over formal for dining and the bar lacked ambiance.[ it probably feels easier in the summer when the poolside bar is operating] The hotel's choice of dining was too limited ; there was no 'coffee shop' option for easy snacks ; and the bar felt like something out of an old time movie. Although we tried these experiences we ended up taking 20 minute rides to find a more happening bar life and international dining.

I tend to prefer quite modern hotels with spacious areas and a hip vibe, so I figured this would be a bit like my grandmother's living room - nice but all wrong for me. Alright, I was wrong. The place is phenomenal with just a couple drawbacks. First, the service is truly impeccable. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, every employee is not only dedicated to your needs, but they are also pleasant and manage not to appear in your face and omnipresent in an annoying way. Trust me - I'm comparing this to St Regis butler service and other premium offerings. It's great. Next, the spaces are shockingly well kept. All of the furniture in my room looked spanking new. And while the decor certainly wasn't my style, it was absolutely perfect for the setting. The bed was wonderful, bathroom great, etc. I got out of the shower one morning and found that the mirror had a three foot wide section, from top to bottom, centered directly over the sink, that was completely fog resistant. Nice. They thought of the little things. Restaurants were top notch. I was there for five nights evaluating an acquisition and ate in the hotel several times. Really exceptional cuisine, and as always exceptional service. The pool overlooking the bosphorus was heated. Why do I mention this? It was 34 degrees outside, but the pool was 83. Steam just poured off of the surface like a hot spring in Iceland. Can;t imagine what it costs to do that, but it made for a magnificent swimming experience. Why four stars? Well, at $500USD/night, a view of the valet station and taxi wating area isn;t so hot. The place is very expensive, and if you want a nice view, you are well north of $500 in a very small room. Another issue was the bar. While nice decor and skilled bartenders are great, there was some godawful perfume or fragance that was so overpowering I couldn't drink one night. Other nights were thick and unpleasant. But one night was literally so bad I couldn't physically breathe. Like getting teargassed. I was not alone. Truly a baffling issue for such a nice place. Either way, the hotel is great and it is located in a great area - Ortakoy. It is a non-touristy but fun area full of history and great food.

The hotel had two very significant draw-backs: a) For individuals wanting to explore Istanbul, the distance from Sultanamet, and the majority of the tourist attraction (Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Hippodrome etc) was a detraction - a very unpleasant 25 minute cab ride (beware of corrupt taxi drivers) made it difficult to hop in and out of the hotel, and b) the hotel did not have any convenience type shops, which meant having to leave the grounds to pick up items like sodas and light snacks, or affordable (light and simple) breakfasts. While I appreciate that this is a very high end establishment, I would still appreciate a small shop for sundry items. Laledan and Turga were very good - excellent service, very good food.

I would give this hotel a 'five' if it weren't for a pattern that seemed pervasive with me and my group of trying to palm off one of the worst rooms in the hotel on us (literally happened to each of us as we all arrived on separate dates)...we had booked \"Park View\" rooms which you should be warned do not look out onto a park at all, but rather a noisy road. Book yourselves the Bosphorus view rooms as they're much quieter and really the charm of the hotel is it's location on the water. My original room didn't even view the Park but a cement wall on the driveway...the front desk manager promptly changed my room once I complained. That little glitch notwithstanding, the service is really nice at this hotel. Front desk and concierge staff quickly started calling me by name and the car service, while expensive, was first rate. Even in cooler months it's nice to have a coffee outside under the heaters if it's a sunny day. Our work event was also handled flawlessly in the Palace section (there was another huge event going on that night but you'd never have known it)...the hotel is the newer structure and the 'Palace' is used for events. I understand there's a nice spa but I didn't get a chance to use it sadly. I'd love to go back for a personal trip and when I do I'll return to this nice hotel.

It was a pleasure to return to the hotel after a long, hot day of touring and unwind on our balcony overlooking the magnificent gardens, pool and Bosphorus. That said, however, with the heavy traffic, getting to and from the major sites could be a nuisance and the hotel is not in easy walking distance of restaurants, etc., so one was captive to the hotel and its high prices. We were able to walk to a few restaurants, but the sidewalk was narrow, crowded and bumpy, so \"easy\" is the operative word here. Our suite in the new building was comfortable, but probably not worth the incremental cost. There was a shortage of shelves/drawers for storage in the luggage closet, so we had to either hang things or live out of our suitcases. Further, the room always looked messy, with all kinds of brochures and pamphlets scattered about. There were six pillows on the bed, of three different densities, so everyone can probably pick a winner. Our balcony was no bigger than that for standard rooms, so being in a suite offered no advantage in that regard. The furnishings were fine and the bathroom was lovely, but nothing exceptional. It is important to book a room on the Bosphorus side of the hotel, as the rooms in front are likely noisy as they look on to a very busy street. The breakfast buffet - try to get a rate that includes this - was spectacular, one of the best we have encountered. Everything on site is expensive, with a 55 minute massage at 200 Euros. The pool is one of the best features of this property. There are plenty of chairs, good service and magnificent views. As noted by several previous reviewers, this is not a warm, feel good kind of hotel. The service, while good, is workmanlike and efficient and it's unlikely that many staff members will know your name or create the cosseted feeling experienced in many hotels of similar stature. There was a huge convention at the hotel while we were there, and I suspect this is common. It did not disturb us in any way, but the milling in the lobby and name tags created a sterile atmosphere. There was free wireless service throughout the hotel, which was a much appreciated amenity.

Rooms are clean, very inviting and comfortable. The hotel itself is beautiful - a real palace, with a very long corridors though. Food in all the restaurants is just a dream, dining right on the Bosphorus in the grill restaurant is a must and unforgettable experience, as all of the other restaurants too, we tried them all and the food was nothing but excellent. Be sure that you have the braekfast in the hotel, a great choice of the most tasteful things you could have.

The hotel was beautiful, the rooms were amazing...but then an unfortunate thing happened. A cashmere wrap that had been left in my room one evening was no longer where I had left it, and indeed, wasn't in the room at all. We called to the front desk and were told to wait for a call back from someone. We waited over an hour - no call. We called again. Finally someone decided to send security up and said they would want to search our room...which we thought a bit odd, since a) we had already done that and b) it seemed like a lack of trust and invasion of privacy. Security and an assistant manager I believe came up with the housekeeper and indeed said they would like to search our room. When we pushed back and said that was offensive, they said they didn't need to and we could continue with the report. However, you can see how that would go....deniying a search that gave them an easy out. So we let them go through all of our bags, our drawers and our closet. It was very odd and extremely uncomfortable. We were told several times that they have never had an instance of theft at the hotel. We were like, well that's nice, but we have something missing. They insisted I must have left it somewhere, or misplaced it. I insisted it had been in the room since day 1. We filled out a report, and never heard from anyone again. At check-out, we were sure someone would mention it at the desk as surely someone would have written something about the instance in our record. Nope. Nothing. My husband demanded a manager - we got another assistant manager who knew nothing of it and after much back and forth agreed to bring the head of security down to speak with us. We also asked for a copy of our report to bring home with us. He again told us they had never had any theft - and that they searched the laundry and asked all of the cleaning staff about my wrap. They had found nothing (go figure - who would admit to taking something!?). They basically said the case was closed and we must have misplaced it somewhere. We thought that this was an incredibly unprofessional way to handle the matter. We never asked for any compensation, but you would think that the hotel would have tried to do something about it. We hadn't claimed to have lost the Hope Diamond after all. The assistant manager did take a breakfast off of our bill (I think more because my husband and I were throwing a fit about it at the front desk), but there was never an apology and we never heard anything further. We were very displeased with that experience and thought it was not befitting of a five star luxury hotel with the price tag that the Kempinski has. As my husband said, we were treated as if we were at a hostile somewhere. Even a budget hotel wouldn't have dealt with the matter in that manner. So, we're here to tell you that although they won't admit it, there is theft at the Kempinski.

It is on the Bhosporus, in the Besiktas neighborhood, which is 5 minutes in a cab or 20 minutes stroll the centre of town. To be able to eat, drink or even swim whilst looking out across the water is really something else. The rooms were of average size, without being anything extraordinary, but were extremely well appointed.

This was our second trip to Istanbul in the past year. Last summer we stayed at the Four Seasons on the Bosphorus. Don't get me wrong, the Four Seasons was excellent (see my review of the same), and indeed, we were a bit concerned that the Ciragan would not be as lovely, but we wanted to try some place different, so we decided to try the Ciragan, and we are so glad we did! As nice as the Four Seasons is, we believe the Ciragan is even better and we definitely preferred the Ciragan. First, our check in was one of the most pleasant I've ever experienced. Our hostess, Elana, greeted us, sat us in the lobby, and quickly went through the check in process. She was friendly, courteous, and efficient with both the room check in and in helping us reserve in a couple of the Ciragan's restaurants. Speaking of restaurants, we ate at both Turga and at the Ciragan \"BBQ\" on the Bosphorus both were fantastic. The BBQ venue cannot be beat (even by the four seasons out door venue), and the food was plentiful and all was delicious. The BBQ manager was also lovely and seemed genuinely concerned that our dining experience was everything it could be. Turga was also fantastic. I read one review on here prior to our trip that praised the atmosphere of the restaurant, but that commented that the food was good, but not great. That was not our experience. The venue is absolutely magnificent, but the food was equally so! Last, but not least, breakfast: our room rate included breakfast each morning at Laledan and what a treat that was! The breakfast is a sumptous buffet. Everything was delicious and the staff were, again, friendly, courteous, and efficient. As for the rooms, our room was a standard one and I really don't think the photos on the hotel's website do these rooms justice, because I was pleasantly surprised when we were shown to our room by Elana. The room was large, well appointed, supremely comfortable, and highly satisfactory. Also I have to disagree with another traveller's review that commented that the hotel looked a bit shabby. We did not find this at all. True, the tvs in the room are not flat screens, but this is very unimportant to me and such a minor flaw in an otherwise flawless presentation. The pool area is also lovely and larger than that of the four seasons. It was quite crowded the day we arrived, but we still had no problem finding two deck chairs, and the staff at the pool were very helpful and quick with orders. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the gentleman who helped us book a tour on the Bosphorus during our stay. A tour company keeps a desk in the lobby and Mr. Sarioglu helped us book a fantastic tour. He gave us many options, did not try to push us towards any of the more expensive options, and was extremely helpful, even personally escorting us via car to the close-by port for our departure! I really feel like I've been gushing during this review, but we have stayed at many wonderful and luxurious hotels and, truly, the Ciragan really impressed us. Indeed, we plan to highly recommend the Ciragan as a venue for a wedding friends of ours are planning fro next summer.

The MOST expensive beer was 24 Turkish liras which is about $12. While that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cheap, it is in line with other truly world class 5 star hotels. The prices are high but in line with comparable properties. Importantly, what sets Ciragan apart from others is the fine attention to detail. For example, when room servcie delivered breakfast, they delivered a toaster with it so the toast would be hot. Every evening there was a beautiful plate of Turkish Delight candy instead of just a mint on the pillow. Nice touches and there are many of them in this hotel. The Ciragan isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t Motel 6 and the room rates and food costs reflect that. I am a very cost conscious person who looks for bargains and am outraged by high prices.

The location of our room was good with a nice view of the pool and then the Bosphorus beyond. Check-in was fine and cordial. The console phone system in the room--which also controls the lights--kept going off and on all day and all night so it would light up in the middle of the night, sometimes waking me up with light and the clicking sound it made. The TV only worked a percentage of the time, usually corresponding with when the phone was acting up. And literally, someone was moving furniture in the room above us at 3:30am the 2nd night we were there for nearly an hour! I don't know if it's a conference room they were preparing or what, but it was terrible trying to sleep with all the lights and noise. The prices were ridiculous. By the pool, a coke cost about $16 USD. A sandwich (very average tasting, and I'm not picky usually) was about $35. We ate at one of the restaurants one night and for those similar prices (about 5 times what you would normally pay for anything), the food was OK, but not special. I'm not against paying for luxury when the experience corresponds, but in this case, there was absolutely nothing to justify the prices. Last, the service in general was terrible. Anytime you needed something from the desk, they seemed bothered, or promised it and it never materialized without follow up. The last day, I stopped at the desk to ask for someone to come get the luggage. Then I went to the room to wait. 20 minutes later, I called because no one showed up while I was sitting doing nothing, so I called down. They apologized and said they would send someone immediately. 10 minutes later, another person called ME and said it was past checkout time and when was I planning to check out! Still no one had come to collect the luggage! In my opinion, for these prices, the customer should be treated like royalty. Again, I am not hugely picky and really never stay in 5-star hotels, so my expectations were that we would have a quality experience for that level of hotel. It did not materialize, and I would NEVER pay to stay there. I have had equally pleasant and much cheaper stays at far lesser hotels.

I had a room with no view, which was a pity - would be worth paying more for the view. But it was a very nice and functional room. Slight problem was that the electricity kept cutting out the evening we were there, but then a generator would kick in and turn on some lights. Free wi-fi was a nice touch too. The location is slightly out of the centre of town, so not perfect for sight-seeing in the old town. However, a 15 - 30 min taxi ride gets you to the old town.

Hearing of my situation at check-in, i was provided with the most grand 'Survival Kit' bag! Classy looking, in a leather-esque fabric - it is almost worth losing your luggage for! Containing toothbrush, razor, Nivea deodorant, all the ususal toiletries, it also provided me with decent short pyjamas (embroidered with the hotel crest), and T-Box tshirt, boxer shorts, and quality cotton socks for the next day. Understanding the plight of the situation, the hotel also provided complimentary laundering of the clothes i was wearing until i could buy more, or my luggage arrived. The next day the concierge team proactively took full control of the situation in making all the chase calls to Istanbul airport on my behalf. They called frequently, and kept me uptodate, and even collected the luggage from the Airport when it finally arrived. All this left me to get on with my meetings, without the burden and stress of trying to resolve the situation myself with a non-native tongue.

Seriously, did we feel like royalty! Firstly, the place is beautiful, a tourist attraction by itself. Although most rooms are not in the actual palace but in a building next to week, you truly feel the experience from the decoration to the service, everything was perfect. We arrived super early and our room was ready. We had booked this via our company's travel agency website (business rate) and had expected to get a bad room. However, we were surprised when the sent us to a great room with the Bosphorus view. Perfect room! Spacious, well decorated, nice bathroom (huge!). The bed was a bit on the hard side so we asked for an extra down comforter and it was perfect. That same night we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate delivered to our room with greetings from the manager. Room service was way too pricey so we never ordered anything. Everything else was excellent. Two things you have to do if you go: 1) pay for the tea service in the afternoon - it's pricey but worth it for the experience and 2) swim in the heated infinity pool outside right next to the Bosphorus. We were so glad we chose this place instead of the Four Seasons (which was our 2nd choice). The Four Seasons was cute too (we went to check it out) but the Ciragan was by far a better experience given that it was close to all the nice restaurants and away from the mess that is the old city.

A definite plus. My wife was happy with the service, decor and comfort. We had a Bosporus view room--expensive, yes, but I think worth the extra groschen. The view out over the Bosporus on moonlit nights was something to remember--quite romantic. As all the guidebooks say, the taxi ride into Sultanahmet from the hotel can be a drag, not only because of traffic jams but also because some of the taxi drivers surreptitiously flip their meters to the higher night rate when they note you are a foreign tourist staying at the Kempinski. Most travellers can afford the higher fare, but it is extremely annoying to feel you are being taken advantage of as a trusting visitor. The municipal taxi authorities would be well advised to put a stop to this my putting timers on the taxi meters that would not allow them to be manually manipulated to the nght fare. Nothing spoils a visitor's impression of a city than to feel like he or she is being ripped off. But I digress. The hotel merits its five stars and charges accordingly for them. It is fully priced.
