Ours had a very small kitchenette with a microwave and fry pan. We wouldn't have ever used the electric fry pan but the microwave came in handy. The location is great if you are wanting to be near Kings Cross which is a about a 3 minute walk. There are plenty of cheap eats situated down the side streets. The hotel offers a nice buffet style breakfast. In the lobby there are several computers if you need the internet. One of the downsides is that they don't have any parking. We were told that we would have to pay around $40 per day in a car park which was not nearby and with children we didn't want to park too far away, so we had to keep moving the car on a regular basis, so as we didn't get a parking ticket. Also the rooms which overlook the harbour are not as noisy as the one we stayed in which overlooks the side street, all night long there were gangs of young people mulling around with their hotted up cars making noise.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff but poor hotel\u201d", "Author": "JohnZ05", "ReviewID": "UR127950007", "Content": "DeVere hotel often appears as one of the cheapeast hotels (around 90 - 100 AUD) when you search for hotels on Expedia or booking and there is little wonder why.

There were broken beer glass bottles littered here & there, & I even saw a used syringe! The situation is so bad there that there were no public toilets in Kings Cross (there is no public toilet even in a shopping centre!)

I ordered a Deluxe Superior room and it was up to standard, although I'm not a fan of the shower/bath, as it was a very small bathtub. My only issue with the hotel, is I was led to believe off of other reviews and the hotel itself that the buffet breakfast was included with the price when actually it was $26 per person, per day. My partner and I thought that was a little excessive and walked about 30 steps to the left of the hotel and had a beautiful breakfast for $10 at the Fountain Cafe. The location is worrying if travelling with a young family, as at the end of the street is a main street of Kings Cross, and there are many eateries on the street but also many strip clubs. In fact, my partner and I were keeping count of how many prostitues we saw and for our 7 day visit, we saw 12, a few in the middle of the day. Quite shocking, really. Just keep that in mind with young ones around. The bright side of the location, is that the Kings Cross train station is just down the road and can be accessed through said street, or through the back streets opposite the hotel, which don't have any seedy clubs but is filled with many backpacking hostels. Overall, we loved our trip and being young 20 year olds, didn't mind the seediness of the street adjacent as we chose to ignore the particular lifestyle but as I said, would advise families to keep this in mind.

Prices were great and affordable and we were pleased with the hotel as the pictures on the website looked nice enough to stay in. Arrival - We arrived earlier than check in time so were allowed to put our luggage behind the front desk. Our first impression of the hotel was nice, a nice lobby with leather couches and internet, which was great! Yet there was no ramp so had to carry our heavy luggage down the stairs. (not good for the elderly). Then we sussed out the hotel resturant which was Indian so good for people who like indian food. But not for our liking. The only downside to that is the restuarant is not open for breakfast.. Safety & location- Faced with the decision of what to do until check in, we decided to go for a walk and sus out what was around the area and walk to the city. Walking through one main street in kings cross was scarey! Did not feel safe at all! You go up mecleay st (the st the hotel is on), and it leads into 'Darlinghurts st' through kings cross. Girls... i do not recommend walking through that street alone! We walked past atleast 7 strip clubs, 6 homeless people, druggo's, small gangs, prostitutes and groups of dirty sleezy men constantly loitering around the area! We were followed by men and yelled at by men wanting 'fun'. You either feel like you're goin to get bashed or violated! I strongly recommend getting the hop on hop off bus! It's a bus that takes you to every tourist attraction for $30 and is an easy way to the city. Walking took roughly 25 mins from the hotel. Hotel room- We were extremely un-impressed with the room we were given! It was a 'standard room' or more like a 'shoe box' room. Not recommended for anyone who is claustraphobic, as I am and had a few problems. Or anyone staying any longer than 4 nights. But we were only staying for a few nights so I survived. 1. There was one lamp that had no light bulb in it, and the other had a broken shade. 2. The room smelt like stale cigarett and had a musty smell to it, 3. the fridge was broken, when i opened it to put my drinks in it it was completely warm! Melted ice and water spilt everywhere, the little milks that they provide were warm and no doubt off! was not game to drink them. Yes there were coffee makeing facitities however check your jug as another guests jug/kettle was not working. No toaster. The bathroom was nice and clean. Small yet understandable for the size of the room. However it had a leaking pipe under the sink. Strangely there were alot of mosquitoes in the room and the window was shut so dont know where they came from. Made sleeping very uncomfortable. Yes there was an opening window, however i'd rather keep it shut with the amount of filth on the outside of the window! We wer located on the 2nd level, our view was a filty alley way with absolutely no way of seeing outside if it was sunny or what. The air conditioner was broken, only the fan part was working, wasn't any actual cold air con. As in another review i read yes it did seem like it was made in the 70's! We actually read on the tag wrapped around the cord and it had not been serviced in 3 years. The cleaning service was great. Made our beds and fresh towels every day. Bed sheets were good and not the type that make you itch. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone who has allergies or the elderly. As the hotel rooms and hallways are musty. There are no ramps for anyone in a wheel chair and the elevator was very small, old, made funny noises and felt like it was going to break down on us! Service- When we approached the service desk with a list of these problems the person working just shrugged it off and said it couldn't be helped, he could get someone to fix the problems but if they cant be fixed we pretty much just had to deal with it! I then asked if they couldn't be fixed could we be moved to another room and they said 'no it was all booked out'. Not even offering a discount for our dodge room or anything! He certainly needed to learn better people skills! We were not impressed as the fact that the fridge was broken how could we buy any sort of food or keep our drinks cold! A few hours later we returned to our room to find the fridge had been fixed but was still not that cold, and the light bulb had been replaced but not the other one. All in all i would give this hotel 2 starts not 3.5 and our room.... 1.5 stars.

The hotel is not good for disabled people, because on the entrance there are about 5 steps and when you go on the elevator there are some, too. The good thing is that there is a very good connection to the center of the city. Just in front of the hotel there is a bus station and the buses drives to the center every 20 -30 minutes. The Sydney and Bondi travel buses stops near by too (2 minutes away). You can also walk to the center of the city, but it takes about 20- 30 minutes to get to the Sydney tower and a little bit more to get to the Opera house. If you like to party a lot, it is very, very close to King's Cross street, with many pubs, bars, night clubs and alcohol shops. The one thing that seemed quite strange to me was, that there were several people working in the hotel that hardly speak English. Really, believe me. The final word....the hotel is not a super deluxe hotel, but it's cheep so you can not expect the luxury things...but in my opinion they could do much more on the cleaning and on personality.

The entrance is a couple of steps higher than the actual lobby, so you had to drag your luggages down, as there was an absence of ramps.

Let me tell you exactly what happened: The guest greeted by a somehow sweet looking gal who seem to know what she was doing except she did not do what is the most important thing in a hotel check in: Tell the guest the TRUTH! There was no mentioning of holding of the room rate after cancellation within the timeframe. There was no mentioning of Terms & Conditions regarding to the release or reverse of holding funds to the guest's account. The question here is : why on earth does the hotel still hold the room rate of the 5th night onto the guest's credit account when the guest has advised the hotel to cancel that night within the timeframe required in the first place? The morale of the story is : who gets the worst end of the bargain? Unfortunately as always is : the Guest! Fortunately though the hotel does have some conscience and decide to make some changes to their 'policy': $50 security deposit now has gone down to $20 If you make the payment for the duration of your stay in the form of cash that includes etpos, you will get your 'unused' room rate charge' and the security deposit when you check out NOT 5 or 10 days after. What does that mean to all the guests : Leave your credit cards at home! If this hotel does not follow the above rule then you guys should step up and do something about it just like I did. This just to prove that They Do Care after all. I was impressed with everything else but that costly mistake made the hotel leaving me almost out of pocket and struggle financially to live through that week is unthinkable. If there is any consolation at all comes out of this experience is the fact I have used this same credit card to 3 other hotels in the same state and I have no issue or problem of this kind whatsoever.

The hotel is more towards Potts Point and there are quite a few nice restaurants around the corner. Apart from the noise which aggravated me the rooms were cleaned daily and to a good standard.

Our Travel agent tried to talk us out of it saying it was a horrible place - which we found far from the truth. Price Range - In regards to previous comments about it being over priced for what it was. Id love someone to show me a hotel with the same amemities that was cheaper and located in the city suburbs. We orginally considered seeking a private room at backpacker accomoation but found that it was more than this hotel per night. Other places, you paid the same but had to share a bathroom. I found the De vere great for the price. We got the room at about 89 Australian dollars a night - off peak. Hotel decoration - The decor was middle of the range. There were no extreme marks on the walls or carpet etc. It is not the slum some people have made it out to be. We did find that you could hear abit of noise from he hallway (if your neighbours were inconsiderate) and there were places through the builing were the floor was a tad uneven. Transport - We found public transport there great. The Kings cross train station is only 5 to ten minutes walk. Its only 3 (small) blocks away. Trains run every 5 minutes and go from 4:30am - 2am every day so I have no idea how the previous person had issues getting back at night. I highly recommend for anyone travelling the sydney to use the train system. It is cheap and efficent. Once you have used it once you are home free The Bus stop to Cirrcular quay is only a directly across the road from the hotel. The bus dosent come as often and dosent run as late at night but is great if you cant be bothered walking to the station. Saftey - The hotel is great. There is someone on reception at all hours and they will open the door for you at all hours. This stops any undesirable people coming in. I would warn people traveling through kings cross, be carefull with your bags as they sometimes have pick pockets etc. The hotel itself is on the cusp of Kings Cross and Potts Point. Potts point is a posh area and i guess you all know that Kings cross is the red light district and a very popular tourist area. Breakfast - We didnt really enjoy breakfast there. We found better deals when walking down to Kings cross and there is a woolworths supermarket across the road. Service - We found the staff really helpfull and friendly. I was constantly asking questions on how to get here and there and they told us the easiest ways etc. We were also put on a roadside room, which was very spacious. We stayed in the room for 3 nights but found that we were getting disturbed by the traffic noise (Sydneysiders love to beep thier horns at all hours of the night). The staff were more that happy to relocate us to a smaller but quieter room on the other side of the building which had a habour view. Comfort - We found the beds comfortable and everything clean and tidy. We had all of hour bedding changed each day and fresh towels like expected. We had no problems. All in all we enjoyed our stay. This is a middle of the range hotel, if you are use to being waited on hand and foot - then it wont be your thing. For the budget traveler who dosent expect much this is a great deal for your money.
