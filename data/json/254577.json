On my first stay i was given room 8, a twin room with high ceilings and a large window and on my second stay was given room 5, again a twin with a lower ceiling and an average sized window but with a separate WC and shower en-suit. Both rooms were very clean and nicely done and had large LCD TVs. I personally preferred room 5 because of the separate shower and loo, worked well for us as when one occupied the shower the loo was available for the other occupant to use, plus the room was very quiet too. Reception was manned 24 hours so no problems with late nights out and the free wireless internet worked good. complimentary continental breakfast was included within the room rate but always missed it due to over sleeping. The icing on the cake was the staff. All were very courteous and friendly especially the lads at the reception who helped us with cab bookings and kept our luggage on departure until late evening. Always ready to help and service minded, an asset for the establishment. Thanks guys.

Our expectations were not too high as we had read some mixed reviews, however, most were positive. With a slight apprehension I called up the place and booked for 3 nights. checked in the next day in the evening and was met with a very warm welcome and we were offered a choice of hot or cold drinks while I filled in the form. We were led to our room which was located on the second floor and the the the receptionist was very kind and helped carry our luggage to the room. The room was a decent size according to London standards. It was nicely decorated, well laid out, clean, comfortable and crisp bed linen. I think the room was recently refurbished. We Loved the the original wood stained floors, gave the room a cosy homely feel. Equipped with a nice sized flat screen, plenty of lighting, ample storage and full length mirrors. What was most appreciated was the ultra sleek tea coffee station which was regularly replenished. The bathroom was not massive but spotless, functional and adequate with soap, shower gel and shampoo bottles. Breakfast was as promised, continental, with a variety of cereals, croissants, cold meat, cheese slices, fruit yoghurt, beans and hard boiled eggs with juices, tea and coffee It was served buffet style, serve your self and eat your fill type. Hot toasts were bought to your table by cheerful ladies serving breakfast. However if you prefer full English then there are many small eateries a stones throw away, serving a good fry up for under \u00a34. The only cons are that there is no elevator, but staff are happy to help with moving luggage. Having floor boards means that you may hear some noise from people staying in the rooms above, but it was generally quieter in the night. Overall a very comfortable stay. Would thoroughly recommend the place especially for the extremely helpful and friendly staff who dealt with all our queries efficiently. Thank you.

Windows with peeling paint, dirty and broken glass, blinds that were not rolling up because the chain that was supposed to be used for that purpose had long ago fell on the heater and nobody bothered to put it back (therefore we had to roll up the blinds by hand and stuff them somehow so that they wouldn't fall back).

It's is located in the historical part of the city so according to the law they are unable to have an elevator. If you stay at 5 floor, you will have to climb up through the narrow stairs. Be careful especially if you climb up with your luggage!! But this is everywhere in 2 star hotels located in old buildings in London. Pros: - Location is perfect, just 5 min walk from Paddington Railway Station and underground (1 transport zone). From there you can reach everything in London. - Also Heathrow Express and Heathrow Connect arrive at Paddington station, correspondingly 15 mins and 25 mins from the airport. So you can get to the hotel very fast!! - Fare. Sometimes you can get a double/twin room for 49 pounds for two persons. Very good for central London (breakfast included!!). Cons: - Some rooms definitely have a big problem with water - they don't almost have cold water, only hot!! It's almost impossible to take a shower!!

Beware of their \"sister hotels\"\u201d", "Author": "minkymoomar", "ReviewID": "UR56296887", "Content": "I feel I need to write this review to warn people of the possible outcome of booking a room at the Piccolino Hotel, because upon arrival you might find that you are reallocated in one of their more down-market and dated \"sister hotels\". Despite the fact we were arriving into Victoria and we could have booked a cheap budget room nearer our station, after much research we decided to book the Piccolino despite the distance from Victoria because of the excellent reviews the hotel has received - due to its recent refurbishment and vast facilities. I made the booking two days before arrival, through Booking.com. Upon arrival the man at reception made no apologies whatsoever about the fact that actually, we weren't staying at the Piccolino. The explanation was simply that, despite the fact the hotel had a vacancies sign in the window for that night, the hotel was fully booked - and we would be staying at the \"Classic Hotel\", 5 mins walk away, along a more noisy street. This is not an isolated incident, and if people check the reviews for the Classic Hotel they will find other examples of when this hotel has been used as a reallocation hotel. The room description for the Piccolino is as follows, \"The hotel is recently refurbished with high standard of d\u00c3\u00a9cor and comfort. All our rooms are en-suite, non smoking and are tastefully appointed with private showers, private toilets, hairdryer, direct -dial telephone, color TV with DVD player, Sky Satellite , radio alarm, free wireless broadband access and hospitality/tea/ coffee tray in all rooms.\" It is for this reason, that the Classic Hotel was such a bitter disappointment and left us feeling cheated. The man on reception was friendly and helpful, and showed us to our room. It was dark, grim and in desperate need of a refurbishment. The dark and oppressive wallpaper was torn and peeled off the walls. The bedspread was stained and had hairs on it. The mattress was hard and so lumpy that you could see the pronounced lumps straight away. There was no Sky TV like the Piccolino - instead there was a small TV with 4 channels with terrible reception, and the inbuilt DVD player's front panel had fallen off. There was a tea and coffee tray with only one mug, no power point for the kettle and no milk. The en-suite was tiny, dirty and had no extractor so you had to shower either with the door open to steam up the bedroom or else be blinded by the steam. The light above the sink did not work, and we suspected dodgy electrics due to the buzzing and flickering of the lights in general. There were no toiletries. We couldn't sleep at night, not only due to the extremely uncomfortable mattress, but also the constant banging of water pipes above our heads. Upon arrival the room was freezing, as the radiator was stone cold. The only redeeming feature was the location and the friendly and helpful nature of the receptionist during the evening. He offered us a late checkout of 12pm to help compensate for our troubles. However the next morning told a very different story, as a different receptionist, who spent a lot of the time on his mobile phone out the front, refused to honour the late checkout, and was curt in his manner. Breakfast in the morning was advertised in the rooms as being served between 8 -9.30am. In actual fact is was served 7.30-9am. It was nice enough, with copious amounts of tea and juices, cereal, toast and boiled egg. The clean bed-sheets were stored on the chairs in the breakfast room right next to the buffet table, which was a bit slack though we thought. We were staying in London because of a gig that night. Due to us being messed around with having to change hotels, we missed half of the gig. We clock-watched the entire night due to the banging pipes, lumpy mattress and room temperature, and this ruined the following day and all we had planned. I have slept better in 1 star accommodation. I would not be complaining if I had booked this hotel at a cheaper price and seen the reviews (I wouldn't have booked the Classic anyway, based on the reviews), but we were so upset at the fact that everything was a far cry from the Piccolino, and I don't feel it is fair to reallocate without notice or apology if someone has booked what they believe to be a good hotel.

Nice shiny wooden floors and well dusted furniture too! HOWEVER: the duvet cover and the blanket were stained and covered in hair, and not just one or two - if you get the drift. When I opened the sheets there were occasional hair there too, and I almost had a fit! I asked the receptionist for a new pair of sheets and got them without any trouble. Thankfully the room - being in the 4th floor - was very warm so I survived without using the wig-like blanket. The new sheets and towels - although clean - were very old and not too appealing, but that could be overlooked. The breakfast room was nice and tidy, with a good selection of cereals, juices, coffee/tea and fresh fruit. You could have boiled eggs and a croissant as well if desired. All was accompanied by a few slices of warm white toast. I found the staff very nice and friendly, no problems there. If it wasn't for the sheets/blanket accident I would stay there again.

The hotel is situated on a quiet street lined with hotels, very close to Paddington Station. The location is a great starting point for exploration of London's exciting and historic sites, and is close to Hyde Park, restaurants and pubs, and shops. The outside appearance of the hotel is quite classy, but once inside, things take on a different spin. The front desk is in a small room down a narrow hallway from the front door. During our 2 day stay, the hallway was crowded with mattresses and springs on their sides and leaning against the walls. Our party had booked 2 rooms - a double which was up several narrow flights of stairs, and a triple which was located on the lower level - again, stairs. This made hauling heavy luggage somewhat inconvenient. The rooms were reasonably sized and looked quite nice, but one of the en suites was so small it was difficult to turn around in. Each time we left the hotel we were required to turn in our keys at the front desk and pick them up again upon our return. The desk was manned 24 hours, so this was not a problem. The gentleman at the desk was very friendly and helpful, offering tips and even making calls to check prices for different modes of transportation to the airport. The young adults in our party found the hotel to be fine, but I was a little more critical. Besides the mattresses leaning in the halls, my partner saw several mice running across the hallway by the downstairs room. This was a bit off-putting to me. Although I'm sure there are plenty of mice in London, I don't want to see them in the hotel I'm staying in! There was a laundry machine outside, under one of the balconies in the front of the building. We could distinctly hear loud talking in the hallways and from nearby rooms, both late at night and early in the morning. I understand this is not management's fault, but it did detract from our sleep and therefore, my impression of the hotel.

Bathrooms are tiny, with poor plumbing, bad lighting and no exhaust. Toilet seat broken and needs 3 or more flushes to remove waste. Bedroom also very tiny, even smaller than the tiny rooms you come to expect in the UK. Windows had cracked panes and had no locks. Anyone could open them ... if they dared. We had a wire-sprung mattress ... more wire than padding, definitely in need of replacement. The breakfast was the usual continental style, and I must make a special mention about the toast. One minute we see a woman (owner/cleaner who knows?) through the dining room window pushing clothes into the washing machine ... next second she's buttering toast and serving the guests ... without washing her hands.

Thanks to the VERY DECEIVING pictures, we were convinced that we got a pretty good hotel deal in London, that is, until we actually saw our room. First of all the room was very uncomfortably small, looked nothing like in the picture. Two people cannot go around the room without bumping into one another. All the furniture was cramped together. For example, the fridge was placed in a corner which is very hard to reach. What made it worst was that due to lack of space, a night stand was placed directly in front of the fridge so one could never really open the fridge without first moving the night stand away. We got the night stand in a way that we could open the fridge about 30 degrees, just barely enough to put some water bottles in the fridge. There was insufficient plug at the wall, so one has to decide whether he wants fridge or he wants light. We decided on fridge since more light would bring more disappointment for us about the room. Second, there was a TV, except that again due to lack of space, the TV was placed behind the hotel door, the view was obstructed by a wall so that one could not lie comfortably in the bed and watch TV. You really have to pull a chair and sit in front of it and strain your neck to watch the TV placed close to the ceiling. On the first day, upon arrival and wanting a glass of warm tea, we discovered that the water cooker in the room was broken. We had to struggle a bit with the wire cable to get the TV turned on. The bathroom had a very intense strong smell, not to mention that it was super tiny. Anyone who is slightly overweight will have problem fitting in the bathroom or sitting on the toilet. The hotel stay does include a breakfast, which was the worst breakfast at any hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed. Two different types of cereals, toast, croissant, and beans were included on top of the normal tea and coffee. A few fruits were also available. The croissant was the worst I ever had, dense like a brick. We noticed that none of the guests finished the croissant in their plates. We never touched the croissant again after that day. The best is yet to come. On the second day when we came back to the hotel room, we found out that our towels weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t where they were \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on the chair, rather, they were thrown randomly on the bathroom floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c next to the toilet, one covering the toilet brush! We could not bring ourselves to use those towels again and so had to ask for new one from the front desk. The next day during breakfast, we got the usual toast since we had absolutely no appetite for the brick croissant. I took a few bites on the toast before discovering that one of the toasts was completely moldy!! Ewww! I checked all the others, although they were fine I still lost appetite for anymore toast at the hotel. We sticked to the English breakfast offered at some cafeteria on the way to the train station at 4 pounds that day onwards. Although the incidents weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t severe, but it showed that the hotel owner and staffs weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t committed on delivering a good hotel service. Hygiene was definitely NOT rated very important in running the hotels. I am very disappointed at this hotel. I think the money was not well spent and I got the worst value out of the money. We will definitely never ever stay there again and will never recommend it to anybody.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cA Terrible, Terrible Place!\u201d", "Author": "Misslady1432", "ReviewID": "UR10030151", "Content": "I know that everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that everyone as different expectation of an hotel, but from my point of view this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had the misfortune to endure. And I am exceptionally angry at the people who wrote nice things about this place because it is through their reviews that I thought it would be a decent place to stay instead of the dirty hellhole it in fact turned out to be. The entire hotel is filthy, badly run, and staffed with unhelpful, unfriendly people who thinks it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s funny when your complain about how bad things are. Myself and my daughter went down to London on business for six nights, and therefore wanted something reasonable and clean, and for almost eighty pounds per night, while you know you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not going to get outstanding, I expected at least a basic degree of comfort and cleanliness. Instead, the room we were put in was absolutely filthy. Every towel and sheet was covered in dark brown stains, caused no doubt by the fact that they, and I use this term loosely, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wash\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd such things in an outside space underneath the main entrance next to bags of rubbish. This being a big deal for me when I travel, I asked for new bedding and towels, only to be given even filthier ones that I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let a dog sleep on. Bottom line, We reached such a level of despair with the situation that we went out and brought new sheets and towels from a store nearby, just after we went around trying to find alternative accommodation. We then had to spend extra time and money in a launderette cleaning these items and some of the hotels own things because the management couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see anything wrong with them. The place is, in a word, a hovel! Lights don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work and are broken. There is dirt and grim everywhere that the cleaners can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be bothered to clean. Tables are thick in black dirt that shows that they haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned in ages. Toilet seats are broken. It takes ages to flush waste away. The shower had hair caught all the way around the door. Wardrobes are crooked. Drinking glasses have cracks in them. The kettle provided has filth and grim at the bottom, while the cups clearly haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been washed from their last use. The maids walk around cursing in either Polish or Russian because they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like doing anything other than smoke in the hallways and hover the stairs, which they are always doing because plaster is falling off the walls and covering the carpet. Even something like a \u00e2\u20ac\u2122Do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sign has been stolen from another hotel, and it doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t end there. The stairs are steep, and if you stay in the attic (which tends to leak in, by all accounts), there is no handrail to hold onto. This is also true of the breakfast area, which is underground and is not easy to reach if you are disabled in any way. There is damp patches on the hallways walls, and bits of wooden skirting board lying around with nails sticking out of it, which is just the sort of thing you want to see if you should have little children with you. Breakfast is yet another farce. I know that it is only a basic continental breakfast, but when we went down once at about eight in the morning, all their was was two little bowls of cereal laid out on a trestle table. No milk, no toast, no buns, no nothing. And the only answer you get if you complain is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWell, no one else has complained\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. This is their get out of jail free card; something they use to let themselves of the hook for the appalling condition of the hotel and to make you feel as though you are being unreasonable for asking for anything better. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care if no one else has complained before. I found it completely unacceptable, and I find the idea of being treated like a third class citizen because I wanted to pay a reasonable price for a hotel instead of the extortionate fees charged by other London hotels unacceptable, so I decided that before I left, I would make my feelings clear in a letter to the management that I left on the door. I will admit that my language wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the nicest, but the experience was so terrible that I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t interested in being gracious to ungracious hosts. This was when one of the men who runs the hotel decided to chase after myself and my daughter and scream insults at us from across the street. They are rude people running a vile hotel, and anyone who says otherwise mustn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any sort of standards when it comes to where they stay. So for anyone thinking of going to this hotel, and is fooled by the deceptive photographs and so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcreasonable\u00e2\u20ac\u02dc price tag, be aware that this is a terrible place and look elsewhere, as anything would be better than this.", "Date": "October 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "karachi", "Title": "\u201cloved the piccolino\u201d", "Author": "zara_abbas", "ReviewID": "UR8514712", "Content": "a very pleasent hotel, situated very close to paddington tube station and hyde park. nice comfortable rooms, with tea/cofee making facilities, sky channels , direct dialing, hair dryers and washroom amenities.
