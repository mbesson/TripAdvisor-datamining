{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nothing special Stayed here for 3 nights. Location is good, not far from the centre although you'd still need to take a taxi to get to most places. Had some problems with our toilet not flushing properly and also they were working on the rooms below in the middle of the night !?!? After a complaint, they promised it wouldn't happen again... They serve good breakfast and the restaurant isn't too bad. Wouldn't go back there, but aside from the troubles we had it seems like a pretty good deal.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR415927451", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Tintin_Belgium"}, {"Content": "Hotel limpio   showReview(12269467, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR825940788", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "aguamarga"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d631018-r7976170-Dongfang_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "631018", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
