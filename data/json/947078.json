We rented an apartment from a very attractive beefy guy and he helped us with our bags to the apartment around the corner. The apartment was tastefully decorated with an orange colour scheme - which looked great when i skyped my family with a massive brandenburg gate picture in the background! One negative thing was that here was no air conditioning in the apartment which meant it was too hot to sleep in Berlin when it was 35 degrees. There were no screens on the windows and a lot of mosquitos which wasn't a good combination Closeby was a PennyMarkt and the groceries were ridiciulously cheap! Also on Motzstrasse there are a couple of fun bars to go to - Scheune is a household favourite and we reminisce about our adventures there often! Don't forget to visit downstairs! The room has lots of maps & guides for your stay and we chose to go on a Berlin Walking Tour & Tour of Sachsenhausen and both were amazing experiences", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cJust an Average\u201d", "Author": "Bali_Berlin", "ReviewID": "UR122667392", "Content": "We are always talking and wanting to stay at this hotel and finally a week ago we are able to stay at this place for the very first time. I did the check-in before 8 PM local time considering there is no one will be available after that, according to some reviews I've read. Check in process was OK. The staff took me to the room and I just saw a very scrappy wooden floor and before that when I enter the building smell of old carpet is sort of a compliment that I didn't want or expect. The room looks spacious because of very poor interpretation of minimalist or perhaps that is was Tom's Zen? What I sort of failed to understand is the cheap furniture and feels like stepping into a showroom of IKEA I mean a very bad showroom I have to say. Anyway we are there and we have to bound to stay since we have paid for 5 nights. Oh one more time, is nothing gay about the place. it could be anywhere or any kind of hotel which probably cheaper and with a better service (oh yes, with the price we have to pay, breakfast will be included) and it just a big old apartment partially turned into accommodation. Overall is just a regular and expensive hotel and with the \"gay\" label to attract people with money.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamilton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWell worth it.

(calls go thru front desk and must be manually transferred - often the guys aren't at the desk so you cannot get the call. also, the front desk is closed at night and opens at about 10am - so you have no way to get a call).

This place is NOT a hotel, although when you google \"Berlin gay hotel\" this place will likely come as the first choice of the list. There is no reception nor hall. Staff is not friendly and hard to be found at the reception desk. Rooms are exaggerately expensive for a standard IKEA design inside, and not so clean. Our room for example had some of the curtains that at a close inspection revealed to be dirty by several spots of encrusted semen. There was no room service for 5-day long stay, except the day before we left. This was partially dictated by the fact that we were sleeping during the whole day and partying during the night till 12pm. Yet, the staff shall consider also this scenario for its guests. It was ridiculous to pay 99 euros/night when we had to ask to the reception for clean linen/towels every day. The staff at the reception, a room aside the Tom's complex (bar, hostel, hotel and apartments) was hard to reach. We had to wait also at our check in for more than 15 minutes, although we warned them well in advance of a late check-in providing all the necessary details. Be aware that payment is before entering the room, for all the booked period! The only advantage of the place is the location, which is extremely central with respect to the area and the facilities there. For the rest, it is absolutely ridiculous the price of their rooms and the fact that they consider it a boutique hotel. Wi-fi in the room was working only if only one laptop / computer was connected to the network. When we attmepted to connect more devices, we had problems.

First this isn't really a hotel as Americans would understand it, but rather a conglomerate of flats turned into hotel rooms. There is a small office that is only open from 10 am to midnight. I entered my room through a building, which had a lift and the rooms were located on the 2nd floor. The rooms themselves have been renovated in the typical minimalist style with hardwood floors. The bed was very comfortable and the room had a television and the bathroom was larger than most. However, there were several short comings. First there was a really strong odor upon arriving, which I think was mold, but the rooms appeared spotless. Airing out the room took away the smell, but it did come back. It was unusually strong and not chemical. Secondly, the price was a bit higher than most hotels in its range and there is no breakfast included as one would find in other hotels, though for around 6 Euros you can buy a coupon for a breakfast at a cafe across the street, which was plated and probably typical of a german breakfast. I chose this place because I thought it was a full service hotel, so people should be aware that this is primarily a room in a flat with few services. It is located in the heart of the gay neighborhood and since bars don't get going until 1 or 2am, it is nice to have a place nearby; however, not all the best clubs are in this neighborhood and during the day and early evening it is pretty dead. There is a nice neighborhood about two blocks away with cafes and in the other direction is KaDeWe the big department store with a large food section and restaurant on the top. The Ellington Hotel nearby is a famous art deco hotel with a jazz brunch. The U-bahn is just down the street so transportation is not bad. Ultimately, I think if you are looking for a budget place there are similar rooms with breakfast for about 30 Euros less in more interesting parts of the city. I do have to say that the staff was helpful and did order a taxi for my early flight, though the day I needed to order the taxi the office was unmanned for most of the day and I tried calling the posted phone number and it didn't work. The room also has no safe and the common hall had wood floors, so though the room was quite to the outside, the interior noise was quite loud. Also they have wi-fi in the rooms, but there is no computer available to those not traveling with lap top.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maine", "Title": "\u201cnot a hotel\u201d", "Author": "somesville", "ReviewID": "UR80714356", "Content": "This should not come up under the list o hotels, but more as room to rent.

I was given a room on the 3rd floor which was exhustive when returning from a late night out. Unless you would want to wait several hours for the lift. Room was of a good standard. On my 2nd night the HOT WATER failed at 1am , this was just not the right time to not be able to have a shower experically when returning from a smokey gay german bar. I Called the reception and they asked a nmber of questions about trying to fix the boiler by urning on light switches outside the shower room, this obviously didnt work. I unsuccesslly went to bed smelling of smoke. The next morning |I had to do the running around to get the problem fixed , and at 11 am they moved me to another room. I used the shower but after several minutes the hot water had run out. You must at this pioint think I must have been seriously frustrated with smelling like a chimney.. I later went to see the hotel manager and explained what had happened, he starred at me as if I was no one and then I asked him would there be any compensation for the inconvience? I was furious and then i asked would i get my money back for one day and he had said no, i then was totally anoyed, and asked to check out. I lost 70 Euros but this was worth paying the price then to do business with someone who just simply does not care about you but just the pink euro.

The location is great, right in the heart of the popular gay district of Berlin. The hotel is nothing more than some cut up apartments in a very old building that many other tenants occupy. The lobby is dark and dirty. The rooms are very plain, slat frames with foam mattress. They list fresh fruit and wi-fi as amenities, but the fresh fruit is two apples and the wi-fi never worked. There is no such thing as non-smoking and the smell of cigarettes are throughout the building. There is no breakfast at all (even though the web site states otherwise). The \"hotel-pass\" they advertise is a joke, nothing more than a tourist advertisement brochure that gets you a free coke or coffee someplace. There is no real staff, nobody to ask questions, get more towels, fix the internet. It's basically one step up from a hostel. There are many other places that are right in the area, which would have been much better choices. This could be a great little place with more amenities, nicer rooms, better and attentive staff and a public room.
