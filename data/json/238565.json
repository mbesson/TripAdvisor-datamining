We booked it directly from the hotel web site as the price offered was much better than on other sites we usually use for booking hotels. The location was perfect and the price was right. The staff was very friendly and they gladly recommended trips and things to do/see when we asked. They can also book tours for you on request, free of charge. You will get a map of the city when you check in and that will come in very handy during your stay. Everything is within walking distance from the hotel. We never had to use public transportation within the city center. We walked a lot and we saw a lot! Comfortable walking shoes are a must for sure!!! The hotel is located just across the street from the Central Station, so you do not have to drag your luggage a lot before reaching it.The easiest way to get to the hotel is to look for the Victoria hotel and walk towards it. Pass this hotel and keep walking for 2 more minutes before reaching A-Train Hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 10:40am after a long 9 hours flight. What a delight to find the room ready and waiting for us! We stayed for 4 nights (March 14 to March 17, 2012) in room 109 B. There was no noise at all as the windows were facing the courtyard. The view was not important to us. We just needed a clean and quiet room to sleep in at night and this hotel delivered! We left the hotel every day around 9am and returned after 9pm to a quiet, clean and cozy room. The room size was adequate for us (for a room this size you can easily pay double in Paris, for example) and if you do not have a lot of luggage (more than 2 suitcases and 2 backpacks), storage space would not be an issue. The bathroom size was also decent (no bath tub, only shower - again, not a problem for us at all). The computer by the reception desk was always available and free to use if you needed to check emails, book trips, etc. Internet connection in the room was available for a fee. Same applies for watching TV. We did not feel the need to watch TV as we were tired after exploring the city every day. We just used the computer downstairs for checking emails and the weather :) Breakfast was also good, offered from 7am to 10am. You can't compare it with the American style breakfast, but the variety offered was enough for us (hard boiled eggs, ham, salami, cheese, jelly, butter, 2 types of cereal, 4 types of bread, orange juice, milk, coffee and tea). The hotel is non-smoking (a plus for us since people in Amsterdam smoke a lot and the canabis smell on the streets is strong at times) and they ask guests to keep quiet and do not party in the rooms. We liked this a lot and we appreciated the fresh smell and the quiet atmosphere that we encountered at the end of each long sightseeing day. If we go to Amsterdam again we will definitely stay here. If you want luxury, look elsewhere. If you want a clean, quiet room within walking distance to every attraction in the city center, then put this hotel on your list.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murieston", "Title": "\u201cGreat wee hotel !\u201d", "Author": "Montysadog", "ReviewID": "UR126345934", "Content": "Booked a 3 night break with wife.

The hotel is easy to find, being almost opposite the central station and less than 5 minutes walk from the entrance where the tourist information and canal boat trips are. We arrived before 10am, expecting to leave our bags and have a walk round the city. However, our room was ready for us and this was a great bonus as we got to have a quick nap after an early start. :) The reception staff were always polite and friendly, although we didn't have much dealings with them apart from handing in our key/getting our key back when going out. Breakfast is a continental breakfast: I don't understand what people expect from a continental breakfast as some of the reviews about this have been bad. However, there was 4 different types of bread to choose from to have toasted or as it was, chicken, ham and cheese as well as different cereals, boiled eggs and jam/marmalade. This certainly filled us for our day. The room was small, although not smaller than any other typical hotel room in Amsterdam and was clean and tidy. We did not have any problem with the size of the room though and it suited us fine. There is a computer with interent that is free to use for guests in the lobby and I believe it was free wifi in the lobby area as well but we didn't use it. A great tip at this hotel is that there is a board with lots of different cards on it that give you freebies or discounts on museum entry. This worked out well for us and certainly better than the iAmsterdam card which you have to pay for, as we didn't use the tram or bus system at all. As I've mentioned the hotel is opposite the central station - easy for connections to the airport and within 10-15 minutes of the main attractions in the north of the city- Anne Frank's house, Dam Square, Red Light district, Science Museum, and many shops and restaurants. It is little longer to the south of the city to the Vondelpark and the Van Gogh Museum, although you could also get the tram. The highlight of our trip was the BOLS factory opposite the Van Gogh museum. It was pretty interesting and you get a cocktail and 2 shots included in your entrance ticket at the end.

Yes, the hotel's by no means 'Four Seasons' quality, but you're sure as hell not paying that kind of money either. When we visit cities to site see, and we do that a lot, our main objective is to find somewhere as central as possible, with decent reviews, that's cheap, but most of all, clean! This little hotel in our opinion, ticked all of those boxes. The hotel's directly opposite Central Station. We got a train from the airport, to this station, it cost around 4 euros each, and took just over 15 minutes to get there. The staff at the hotel were very welcoming. They were polite, friendly, and professional. We requested to change rooms, as the one we'd been allocated was possibly in the worst position you could ever want your room to be in. On the ground floor, in between the breakfast room, and next to the lift. We had to wait over 3 hours until our other room was available, but this wasn't a problem. We left our bags in the luggage room, and went out to do what we came for - to sight see. I think each individual room is different in this hotel. Ours was very basic, but had everything that we needed, and expected for the price we paid (not very much), and the room was in a very quiet part of the hotel. Don't be expecting a little tray in the bathroom with complimentary shower caps, moisturiser, shaving kits etc, as there isn't any. There's a dispenser with hand wash, which was fine by us, as we like, and take our own stuff. There's a safe in the room, and a tv with some English channels on it if you're bothered. Breakfast is served between 7-10am. It's a very small area where the food is, but it's adequate, as it's only a small hotel, so there wasn't a huge battle to try and get food. There's a few cereals to choose from, a few different types of bread (the fruit bread is gorgeous toasted), and there's some sliced cheese and ham. There's hot drinks available, and orange juice. You can also have boiled eggs if you ask. The blonde lady who was there at breakfast was lovely, nothing was any trouble for her, or any of the staff for that matter. Their English is excellent!! Checkout is at 11am, and the staff check your room before you leave. So be prepared to wait 5-10 mins, in case you checkout bang on time, but have to leave straight away. Our flight wasn't until much later on, so we left our bags in the luggage room until we were ready to leave. When you come out of the hotel, if you turn right, there's a place on the corner called the 'Soup Kitchen'. It's great value for money, and the soup's home made, and very nice. It was ideal, as the weather was ice cold when we were there. There's a restaurant called 'CAU', and in our opinion, it was fantastic. We had the nicest steaks we had ever eaten, and they're cooked in front of you. The staff were efficient, and friendly too. There's lots of quirky little places to eat and drink, as well as the bigger, more established places, and there's lots to do. It's the first time we've ever been to Amsterdam, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It was better than we expected, and we'd most definitely return. I'd like to go back in the Summer. It's not the cheapest City to eat/drink in, and you can very easily spend the cash if you're not careful. Luckily, we weren't on a tight budget, but if you are, shop around for lunch/dinner, as everywhere seemed to charge totally different prices. As long as you don't forget, that it's a low budget hotel, then you shouldn't be disappointed. Do your research before you go, like we did. That way, you shouldn't have any nasty surprises. Everyone has different opinions, and standards, so be mindful that they're just that. We appreciate nice things/surroundings, and have been lucky enough to stay in some wonderful places - but we're no snobs.

There is a railway station in the airport complex, and tickets can be obtained from either the self-service kiosks located in the airport's entrance hall or from the ticket office at the rear. Tickets from the ticket office are slightly more expensive, perhaps 50 cents more. Trains depart from a level below here. When you arrive at Amsterdam's Central Station leave by the main entrance, then turn right and walk past the taxi stands. When you come to the bridge over the canal, cross it, and as you walk over look to your right. You will see the A-Train hotel's sign on the hotel's roof on the opposite bank, about six buildings along to the right. The journey from the station to the hotel is only about three or four minutes walk. The hotel is located between a gift shop/mini-market and the rear entrance of a large supermarket, although it is not readily apparent when you look at this latter building that it is in fact a supermarket. On the floor of the small reception area of the hotel is painted a railway track, and this feature extends right through the Pullman Lounge, which is the breakfast room to the rear of the building, and is one of many very characterful features of this delightful hotel. We found the reception staff to be very helpful indeed, and they all spoke excellent English. Access to the bedrooms is by passing a tag on the key fob over a sensor and care needs to be taken not to confuse the tag, as we did, with the one for the television! Bedrooms are in two blocks, A at the front of the building and B at the rear. B is accessed at ground floor level only, and through the Pullman Lounge. There are two lifts, one in each block. Our room was in A block and fairly small, as I think many of the rooms are at this hotel. The furniture consisted of twin beds, with individual lights, a less than full sized wardrobe with two shelves, but the safe, which was free took up much of one shelf's space. There was a narrow shelf fixed to the side of the wardrobe and a desk, plus two chairs and a television. Some channels you have to pay for, but several are free. We stayed for four nights, and had we have stayed longer I feel that the lack of provision for clothes would have posed something of a problem. There was no air-conditioning, but there was a portable electric fan, which we needed because the weather was very warm. The shower room was quite large enough, and the only toiletry provided was soap from a dispenser, so do be sure to take your own. Our room was very clean, and I personally found the bed extremely comfortable, but some people may have considered it to be slightly soft. We were at the back of A block, so it was quieter than a front room would have been, but the down side was that the view was of the rear of the other block. We weren't concerned at all though by this. The breakfast room is extremely characterful. There are tables arranged in booths for two or more, and over the seats are the type of luggage racks that used to be found in trains of former days with even small suitcases on them. Train memorabilia abounds throughout, with pictures of railway stations and trains from all over the world. Breakfast was a cold buffet, with plenty of choice, including cheeses, meats, breads etc. Hot drinks are obtained from a machine, and are free during breakfast hours, after that they can be obtained at any time for a very modest charge. The lady who served in the breakfast room spoke excellent English, and we found her to be very helpful at all times. My only criticisms of this hotel are that most of the bedrooms are fairly small, although I understand that there are some larger ones at an extra cost, and the lack of space for clothes. Other than that I have only praise for the hotel. It's very central, Amsterdam is a very easy city to walk around, and if I should return again to Amsterdam I would certainly consider staying at the A-Train and have absolutely no hesitation whatsoever in recommending it.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dayton, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGood location, but too noisy\u201d", "Author": "markjchambers", "ReviewID": "UR78419636", "Content": "Close to the train station, nice staff, decent breakfast, but postage stamp rooms.

Very easy to find and on the main road. No disturbances from road traffic or from the train station at night at all, and we had a comfortable sleep. The hotel is designed with a 'Train' theme as the name suggests and my wife found it very amusing!! There is a vending machine downstairs, which some may find useful.. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Rooms/ Bathrooms are clean and well maintained. The breakfast is also sufficient and good. On the last day we went at 11:00 AM as we did not feel like getting up from bed earlier. Surprisingly breakfast was still available, even though the stated time is till 10:00 AM only. One thing to be aware of is that, though the hotel advertises 24hrs check-in, it really is not so. They should tell this clearly to avoid disapointment while checking in. I arrived with my spouse at around 7:00 AM and even though the booking confirmation said 24hrs check-in, the manager asked me to come back around 12 noon- 1:00 PM. He offered us tea/coffee, use of toilets and clean towels to freshen-up. Perfectly happy, we left around 8:00 AM and returned back around 1:45 PM.

In three weeks you learn the ins and outs, and this place was exceptional. The first night, the bed was extremely soft, and I told the manager, Ali Hassan, that for so long a stay,, I could not sleep on that mattress. That very day, he had cut a piece of thick board to the size of my mattress, and put it under it. Worked well. He and the rest of the staff were wonderfully kind and patient to our many questions, helpful and knowledgeable. The rooms were clean, the breakfast adequate, the location, right across from the Centraal Station, terrific. And a big plus, not easily noticeable, was that right next door, on the left, was the back entrance to a complete supermarket, beer and wine, fresh fruits and vegies, salads, breads, everything. Plus an ATM inside the door. We did have a \"premium\" room, that had a fridge, makings for coffee and tea, and a lounge chair. Storage was good too. Breakfast, from 7am to 10 or a little later, was always well stocked, and at any time of day you could pay 1.20 euro for a cup of most anything you wanted. In a word, they treated us like family and I would not hesitant to stay there again in a heartbeat. One caveat - our room faced the front and it was most always quite noisy from the street. However there was no noise from within the hotel itself, having only four rooms to each floor. And the view was great. For those so inclined, there is a casino to the right of the hotel. And if you're into trains, this is most definitely the place for you, as the owner and manager have amassed the most amazing collection of train collectibles I've ever seen. In the rooms, in the halls, and in the breakfast area. People would take pictures of all the stuff.

The hotel couldn't be easier to find - you can see it as soon as you exit Centraal Station - it's literally one minute away. The chap on the desk was very friendly and we were checked in within a couple of minutes. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived (2.30pm) so we left our bags in their cupboard and went for a wander. The location of the hotel is brilliant - out of the door and turn left for the canals of the Jordaan, turn right and you can be at Dam Square or in the Red Light District within a few minutes. The museums are a little further away, but the beauty of the A-Train is the proximity of Centraal Station - the transport hub of the city. Jump on one of the frequent trams and you can be in the museum district in about ten minutes. When we returned a couple of hours later, we were given our key and directed to room B004 - this is on the ground floor at the rear of the hotel, just beyond the dining area. The room was very small - this seems to be a theme in Amsterdam given the nature of the city's buildings, but I think this room is smaller than most, certainly when compared with pictures on this site. The room had a TV, desk and wardrobe with a safe. No tea or coffee facilites, although there was a snack and coffee vending machine near reception. The bathroom was good - nice powerful shower in the corner, although the ventilation was terrible and made the rooms very warm. The weather during our stay was excellent (25 degrees plus, no cloud, little breeze) which was fantastic, except the room was a bit of a sauna. No air-conditioning available (there was a fan, however) meant that things got a bit warm. The room backed onto a small area between buildings so there was no wind at all, and the windows barely opened. This, coupled with the crampedness of the room, was probably the biggest let-down. A buffet breakfast was included in the price of the room. The offerings were okay - breads, cheese, ham, cereal, yoghurt and the coffee vending machined switched onto 'gratis' mode. I have had much better offerings from similarly pitched hotels elsewhere in Europe, but it was enough to start the day with. In summary, the staff and the location made this hotel.

We booked the \"Old Master\" suite which has its own little courtyard garden which we didn't actually use as we were out & about most of the time. The room was very clean and plenty big enough for us & had a lovely en suite shower room. Despit previous comments we didn't get the floor soaked just a little spray from the water while getting washed. The bed was comfortable & there was tea/coffee making facilities as well as a TV which had English speaking channels but we barely switched it on. The staff were friendly & helpful & as we informed them in advance of out arrival time they had the room ready for when we arrived. This is probably not possible in high season as the room will be occupied from the day before. We were allowed to leave baggage in a secure room on the day of check out too. The hotel is perfectly placed for those arriving at the train station or as we did on a coach from Rotterdam as it is very close to the drop off point. We got off the coach & looked across the road & there it was. It does have a train theme which I thought was very nice, if you don't like that sort of thing then you probably won't like it but it does after all make no attempt to disguise that it has a theme so no one should be surprised. The restaurant has railway buffet type seats & decor. The food was a usual continental style breakfast & was very nice, everything was fresh & plentiful. The problem some people have with leaving the key at reception was not a problem with us, we have had to do that in many hotel that we have visited & I actually prefer it, stops me losing it. As someone is at the reception desk all of the time there is no problem with picking up/dropping off of the key. You are given a little card to show them when collecting it.

(I recall only cornflakes being available). While looking for hotels prior to arriving in Amsterdam, I am pleased I chose the ATrain as I was able to see all the other hotels in person once I arrived a did they ever appeatr filthy!

The airport provides a shuttle to the various hotels in the city. A round trip is 19 euros, one way is 12 euros. The best part about the hotel was its location.

There\u00c2\u00b4s also an internet cafe right around the corner. It costs about 2 euros for an hour. The hotel charges 5 euros for a 30 minutes. The other great thing about the hotel is the staff. They speak English very well and are genuinely kind and helpful. I overslept and was late to the airport for my flight, but they were nice enough to have the shuttle make a special trip for me.

Having read reviews about the hotel before we travelled (indeed was swayed by them when booking) we were delighted with what we found when we got there. Within a stones throw of Central Station it couldn't have been easier to get there from the Airport and we found a warm and friendly welcome on a cold, wet Amsterdam evening. Yes, it was unusual to be asked to pay on arrival but wasn't a huge problem, and having to hand in the key each time we left the hotel was no problem at all. After all, there is a master key for the maid service so if anyone wanted to \"sniff around\" while we were out (see comment from Los Angeles traveller) there is always the opportunity, as in any hotel. We stayed in the triple room which was plenty big enough for the three of us and everything was spotless and nicely decorated and furnished. Crisp white sheets on the beds always get a \"thumbs up\" from me. The only down side was that this was a 'smoking' room and personally I think it's time all such rooms were banned in all hotels. There was a faint hint of stale smoke in the air, particularly when the room had been closed up for the day! The bathroom with the 'wet room' type shower was also spotless with soft white towels - you just had to remember to move everything to the far side of the bathroom before showering. The power shower was excellent and one of the best we've found in any hotel, anywhere. Breakfast was very good and relaxed. A typical 'Continental' breakfast with cereals, hams, cheeses, a selection of breads, boiled eggs, toast, juices, tea & coffee etc. from a free vending machine, and everything fresh. Nothing wrong with that! Much better than the so-called continental breakfast we had recently in a London hotel (why am I not surprised!). The surroundings of the Pullman Lounge was interesting and full of character. In the absence of tea/coffee making facilities in the bedroom, it was also good to be able to get a hot drink from the vending machine any time during the day or evening, at a small cost. For location the A-Train would take some beating. All the major attractions of Amsterdam are within walking distance, and unless you are on a very short break and don't have time to stroll the streets and canals, there really is no need to use the trams or canal boats at all, although both are easily accessible straight across the road outside the Central Station if you do need them. There is a wide choice of restaurants in the vicinity, of all cuisines, so no need to go hungry! In conclusion all I can say is that we look forward to catching the A-Train again some time.

Beware if you have very young children though. The room was clean, reasonably spacious and had everything we needed (including the much appreciated kettle, tea and coffee-also had microwave).

I was reluctant to book it at first, but was swayed by the price. The fact that they insist you turn in your key each time you leave the hotel (and pay upfront) gives you that uneasy feeling that you are not to be trusted and you in turn don't feel comfortable leaving important items such as jewelry and passports -- even though they have a safe. Trust goes both ways, and I resent the obvious fact that my movements are monitored and that anyone can pop into my room and have a sniff around. I don't buy the owners comments (fire etc) as other bigger hotels have log books which they rely on to know which rooms are occupied. If you don't trust your customers they in turn will not trust you. Aside from that, it is a clean and quiet and cheap. I was little peeved at first as I requested a room with a view, but got thrown into one without, but after returning to the front desk it was rectified. Overall, it is a decent hotel for a VERY short period -- rooms are really TINY (can't swing a cat!) and breakfast is very basic (cheese, ham, bread, cereal) no hot breakie, but it is a cheap and cheerful hotel. You get what you pay for. Staff are not overtly friendly, not helpful with directions -- more subdued and serious. I won't stay again only because there are zillions of other hotels in A\u00e2\u20ac\u2122dam all also centrally located and as a serious traveler, I firmly believe in never going to the same place twice -- not unless the service (or food) is exceptional and at the A-Train it isn't, but I would certainly recommend a traveler on a budget to stay a couple of nights here.", "Date": "April 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rugby, Warwickshire", "Title": "\u201cLoved the train memorabilia\u201d", "Author": "Julie1158", "ReviewID": "UR4570742", "Content": "We stayed for four nights at the beginning of February and were delighted with this hotel.

The location is close to many sites, as well (we walk a lot - the distances were not formidable from the hotel). The desk staff were all friendly and helpful. I thought the breakfast was good, as I don't expect anything more than coffee and bread/butter when in Europe. Anything more than that a bonus to me! We stayed in the Old Dutch Masters Room, which has a private patio. The rooms are small, but no more than what is usual in Europe. I wasn't a fan of the bathroom - unheated and water everywhere when you shower due to the setup. Our biggest issue was the camera on the patio, which we didn't notice until 20 minutes before leaving - and I'll admit in advance that was unnerving only because as US citizens, we are a bit zealous in our expectation of privacy. At least we know now, and it wasn't a huge issue - we just didn't know about it or expected it. Inroom (through ethernet cable) or lobby internet access was not free - I'd like to suggest making the in-room internet either free or reduce the price a little. Every other hotel we stayed at in the Benelux on this trip had free WiFi. A-Train was the only place using Ethernet and that charged for in-room access for laptops. We would definitely go back if if were winter.

Since I often use tripadvisor to weigh up options when travelling I thought I'd contribute something back with my first review here. The A-Train Hotel is very conveniently located, being on the opposite side of a road and small canal basin from Amsterdam Centraal railway station. Thus it is also a short walk from Dam Square and other central attractions. Most of Amsterdam's tram services start from outside Centraal Station (and many buses), and the canal basin mentioned is home to a couple of the companies offering a variety of canal cruises. It is thus easy to get to much of Amsterdam and the rest of the Netherlands quickly and easily from the A-Train hotel on the public transport system. Centraal Station is just a 20 minute train ride from Schiphol Airport - we landed at Schiphol at 2035 and were at the A-Train hotel by 2130. The A-Train is a family-run hotel whose owners are clearly dedicated to ensuring your stay with them is a pleasant one. All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. We were asked to pay on arrival (even though we had reserved with a credit card), and this might not be every customer's ideal way of doing business but with hindsight, at the A-Train at least, I'm sure of their will to address any justifiable problems quickly. Our room (described as a 'first class' room on their web site) was compact but clean and comfortable and featured a walk-in shower, wc, refridgerator, comfortable arm chair and tea and coffee-making facilities. Heating (radiators) and hot water supply to the bathroom were good. Although our room was situated on the front of the building the windows (when closed) ensured we were not unduly disturbed by traffic or other noise from outside. There is a lift to take you to the upper floors. Internet access is available for those who need it. The breakfast buffet featured fresh white, brown and fruit breads (and toast too), hard-boiled eggs, ham, cheese, honey and jams along with several breakfast cereals and also tea, coffee and hot chocolate drinks. The hot drinks were dispensed from a machine but this didn't detract from their quality. Breakfast was taken in the lounge area (no-smoking at breakfast time) which, along with the rest of the hotel, has a railway theme. No meals are served at the A-Train (other than breakfast) but there is a vending machine between the reception area and the lounge area selling cans of Heineken beer and soft drinks, along with crisps and chocolate. Obviously there is a very wide choice of restaurants in the City - for a lucky-dip selection I'd recommend catching the Tram to Leidseplein (No.5 from the hotel will certainly get you there). Joselito's Tapas bar around the corner from the A-Train (turn left when leaving the hotel and keep walking along and round the block until you find it) is ideal if you want somewhere close to the hotel. I've visited Amsterdam many times over the years and have never found a hotel there that I'd like to return to - until now. Any future visits we make to Amsterdam I'll be staying at the A-Train.
