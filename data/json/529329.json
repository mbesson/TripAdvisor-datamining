Each motel-style room had a small, private covered outdoor sitting area enclosed by hedges -- not exactly a \"garden\" but still a nice touch. Although the shuttle to the subway was not frequent, it did arrive right on schedule. Computer cable in the room had a fee, but WiFi in the lobby was free. In the end, we were pleased.

The shuttle service is very nice, but it may be more often, and the last pick up from Cinicetti should be later than 21:50h especially in the weekend. For the rest if you are not such a good sleeper, than choose another hotel, cause the plains will wake you up for sure very early. The room is clean every day, the beds are okay to sleep on it.

There is a free courtesy bus to and from the metro then an easy 20 minute ride to the Spanish steps. The staff spoke English and could not be more helpful.

The place was nice, quite far away from the metro station - we were dependent on the hotel`s shuttle bus which run as per the timetable; getting back to the hotel in the evening was a little bit more difficult as the shuttle bus (which was just a normal car for 4-6people) run every hour or so. Walking distance to the closest metro station was at least half an hour or even more. We liked the place, the room was nice even though the walls were covered with a little bit of mould; But the staff there - especially the room service and the admin person behind the reception counter - not friendly or nice at ALL!!! Very disappointed!

I probably haven't seen the hotel at its best (it feels more like a \"summer\" type of place, with a swimming pool and deck chairs in a semi-rural setting), but the experience has been a positive one. The rooms are clean, the breakfast buffet is good, staff are always polite and helpful. They have a free shuttle to take you to the metro station or to the nearby companies, or to their associated restaurant nearby, for most of the day. Not ideal if you want to experience the capital's night life, as it takes around 30 mins by taxi (at night) from central Rome, and most taxi drivers try to take you the long way (adding around \u20ac10 to the bill). I would recommend it if you're on a driving holiday, or if you want to stay in a quieter place that will allow you to get into Rome only when you feel like it, and relax by the pool the rest of the time.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Piccolo Borgo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d529329-Reviews-Piccolo_Borgo-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$50 - $235*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via delle Capannelle 134</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00178</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529329", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/e7/cd/58/piccolo-borgo.jpg"}}
