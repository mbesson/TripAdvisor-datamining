Main tourist attractions-need to walk 15-20 minutes and then \"tram\". Steep hill to walk to main areas in Sultanahmet. Nice places to eat close by. If you are interested in night life-nothing in the area and you would need to take train or tram.View from dining room is nice and breakfast is average but was included in room price-so good value for money. Hotel is very good value for money. Room was spotless and bathroom had shower only which for us is all we need. Hotel is clean and we had a turkish bath(? hamam) in the spa in the basement and again excellent and good value for money. A very nice couple run the spa.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alger", "Title": "\u201cDo not lose your time to look for a hotel, Marmaray is the best choice.\u201d", "Author": "radia-from-Algeria", "ReviewID": "UR115745008", "Content": "Marmaray hotel is located in a very strategic place; it is surrounded by famous historical places such as: Blue mosque, Aya-Sofia, Place of Topkapi, University of Istanbul and not far also le Grand bazaar. As concerns the hotel, is built in the modern style, the rooms are quit small but well arranged, its workers are very helpful and kind. The breakfast room is found in the top floor, it has a panoramic and a wonderful view of the Marmara Sea; that you wished to see each morning. Other impotent places that I forget to mention are the Princesses\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 islands, the boat takes visitors till there, and you will get the opportunity to see Bosphore and Marmara Sea in the same time. For the visitors who like shopping, they have to visit Taksim and Beyazit, the bus station and tramway are not far from the hotel. For us, it was really an excellent and unforgettable 'Honey-moon' into Turkey.
