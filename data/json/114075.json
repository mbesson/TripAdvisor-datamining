The location is the best on the beach, with great beachwalks to the north and the south. The people were fabulous, they could not do enough for you, even though the hotel was full. We switched rooms with no problem, when we found ourselves on the lowest level facing the tennis courts to a great room on the 4th floor. The rooms are a little dated, but very comfortable, you could be any Sheraton hotel and have the same room. The amenities are great - coffee maker and a little fridge for milk and cold white wine. I was there with my 12 year old daughter and there was plenty to do for both of us, from Yoga and Pilates, to a great run on either beachwalk, to just lying by the pool or snorkeling at Black Rock - we were never bored or hungry, with lots of places to eat.

The location is great- on the far end of the beach so it's more quiet than the other hotels down the beach. It's a nice walk along the boardwalk down to Whaler's Village. We saw a monk seal sunning on the beach. Our room had a nice ocean view- we watched the whales jumping out of the water from our balcony. The hotel is older and feels a bit dated. However, our room seemed to have been recently refurbished. It was rather large and nicely appointed. The pool is beautiful but it was too cold to comfortably go in for more than 5 min. During a warmer time of year I am sure it would be fine. It was difficult to get lounge chairs around the pool. The service could use some work- we sat out in lounge chairs for a few hours and not once did a server ask us if they could get us anything. We ate lunch at the Cliff Dive Bar once as we didn't feel like going anywhere. The bill came to $54.00 for 2 appetizers (pulled pork tacos and mahi mahi tacos), 1 daquiri and 1 iced tea. Hotel prices are always high but this was a bit much. The service was terrible- we sat there for 5 mins. before anyone acknowleged us and it took a long time to get our food even though they weren't very busy. Strangely, the prices in the gift shops weren't bad. Unfortunately we missed the cliff dive ceremony. It was raining the first night and they didn't have it and th other nights we were out for dinner. There was a coupon for a free tote bag in our room. It is really a ploy to get you to go to a time share presentation. We just got the free bag and didn't bother doing the presentation. There is a $25 per day resort fee to be aware of.

We were pleasently surprised to find we had been upgraded to a suite that overlooked one of the pools and ocean. What a view.... The staff were very helpful and freindly, always saying Aloha as they pass you in the corridor which is nice. February seemed to be a good time to stay as it was busy enough to have some atmosphere, but not so busy that you had to fight for a pool lounge or a seat at the bar. We ate at the hotel restaurant where the food was very nice. The Cliff Dive Bar was great. Right next to the pool area overlooking the beach. It provides the perfect location for a few cocktails during happy hour while watching the sunset and the ceremonial cliff dive which also occurs at sunset. We used the fitness centre which was fairly well equiped with cardio equipment as well as weight machines and free weights. The Sheraton is located at the end of a beach strip. It is the last hotel so people don't really need to walk down there unless they have a purpose so it was never really busy down our end of the beach. It is only a 5-10min walk to whalers village which has quite a few restaurants and dining areas that cater for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks. There are also a range of shops as well but not too many. We really didn't do anything in Maui expect relax and recover on the ebach and by the pool and it was exactly what we need.

Staying at the Sheraton Maui Resort did just that! The hotel and all its amenities were absolutely first class. With different sorts of dining facilities to chose from, including Japanese and pool side, and an especially well-equipped exercise room - you can run on the treadmills both inside and out on the balconies overlooking the ocean - you could put on extra pounds and take them off again at the same time. The inter-connecting swimming pools (features among the 10 best in the world) were always fun, and the pool-side service was great, including being able to watch the sunset torch-lighting ceremony with the Hawaiian divers taking off from the 60ft high Black Rock. The rooms were always spotlessly clean, the beds very comfortable, and having an ocean-view room even made waking up early a pleasure. All the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and the service at the reception desk was very good. (The only small criticism is that if, because of your flight arrival time and the bus drive from the airport, you get to the hotel after 10:00 pm, there are no dining facilities available. So either pack an extra sandwich or prevail upon the night staff to rustle up a bag of peanuts, as they oblingingly did for us.) The Sheraton Maui is partnered with the two Westin Hotels at Kaanapali, so you can use your guest card to dine in their restaurants if you wish and have it added to your Sheraton bill - very convenient. There is a frequent courtesy hotel bus service between the hotel and the nearby village of Lahaina so you never need to worry about having to get a taxi to get around. Also within a short walking distance is the Whalers Village, with a whaling museum and a variety of shops and both short-order and full service dining rooms.

There is a policy that you cannot put your things on the chair to claim it for later. We've been a few places where you have to get up at the crack of dawn to claim a chair! Food at the hotel is mediocre. You're better off going off property. (I highly suggest Lahaina Grill--best food!) If you do stay for bar food, the menu at the MaiTai bar is better. Front desk was VERY helpful. We requested a junior suite and we had a clean, nice room in building 2 on the first floor. HIgher up would have had a better view of the ocean. They suggested we move to a larger suite on black rock. That view was great! We were not unhappy at all with the first room--THEY knew what we were looking for and suggested it for us. I thought that was cool. The Spa is amazing---have a glass of water, it is delicious! They put cane sugar, vanilla, and oranged slices in it. It's like candy!

We were also annoyed that housekeeping came in everyday to clean the room despite having the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign up. Other than that, we still really like this hotel. The location at Black Rock can't be beat. We enjoyed the spa, the Mai Tai bar (better than Cliff Diver Bar) and the pool. All in all, the standard resort view rooms (we were in Building 3) are fine for just a \"room\" and base for other activities and enjoying the amenities of the hotel.

Our ocean view room was upgraded to a beautiful suite on the 2nd floor, one flight of stairs to the pool and beach. We could watch whales from our balcony. We also had a great view of the resort luau. We brought our binoculars and spent every day on the beach watching whales. The resort rents beach chairs for $12.50 each and umbrellas for $25.00 per day. Considering you can rent them from 8am to 5pm it's a great price for a day's entertainment. You can also rent chairs from other shops or bring your own. We liked the convenience of renting on sight and having them set up. The staff anchors the umbrella for you so it won't blow away. This is a great snorkel beach. You can rent all equipment on site or at any of the rental shops in town. We chose to drive the 10 minutes to Cheeseburger In Paradise in Lahaina for a moderately priced, delicious breakfast each morning. The restaurant has ocean views and a fun ambience with a friendly, fun staff. When in Lahaina be sure to visit the banyan tree. Amazing! While in town we could also get picnic supplies for the beach at Safeway or Subway. If you shop at Safeway be sure to apply for their club card for a price break. We bought a styrofoam cooler at Safeway, but you can also rent a regular cooler at any snorkel shop. We like Boss Frog's in the mall next to Safeway. The staff at the resort couldn't be nicer or more attentive. While the resort is beautiful, it is laid back and casual, come as you are. We had dinner each night at the Cliff Dive Bar. The food is delicious and less expensive than in most restaurants. The bar is right on the ocean so you can watch whales and see the sunset cliff dive ceremony. They also have live music and hula dancers each evening. It's just a relaxing, beautiful place to have lunch or dinner. We didn't fly out until 11pm our last day, but the resort still let use all the facilities and gave us a keycard to the fitness center so we could shower before we left for the airport.

It was my first trip to Maui and I was in complete awe with how beautiful it truly is. The Sheraton is a fabulous location ; perfect beach, wonderful view and walking distance to Whalers village. I was curious as to what to expect when it came to some reviews concerning the dated hotel, and semi-mediocre service but we were very pleased with everything. Location: The hotel is set by Black Rock which is wonderful for scuba diving and snorkeling (I do not know first hand, but some friends were raving about how incredible it was). It is about a 10 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 15 min walk to Whalers Village which has a wonderful variety of stores and restaurants (including ABC which sells beer, snacks, wine and hard liquor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c good to know as drinks can become quite pricey at the hotel). The beach walk is great !! We walked it every morning and it will take you along the beach for about a mile past all the other resorts and hotels There were several mornings that we were able to see whales not too far from shore (close enough to get pictures). Rooms: (We were in building 3 floor 5) We had the junior Ocean View suite and it was beyond perfect. We could sit out on the patio and watch the sun set. It was a spacious room with a sitting area which worked out well as I was awake at 2:00am due to jet-lag, and I would go and read while my husband slept. The room (mainly the bathtub area) was a bit dated, but really not too bad in the grand scheme of things. Only negative was we had 2 double beds which made for a snug fit. There was an ipod docking station which was nice. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows and duvet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so no problem sleeping. The room service menu had a good variety and the portions were perfect. We had dinner in our room one night and breakfast 3 mornings \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the presentation and promptness of delivery were excellent. The smoothies were delicious and the macadamia nut pancakes were fantastic ( I highly recommend them). Pool: Yes the pool is very cold. In the end you just become used to it. They have several small bean bags floating around which helps keep at least part of your body from freezing. The layout is very nice and sort of weaves itself around the beach area. There is a small slide as well as a hot tub in a grotto style setting. Pool Bars: There are two bars / restaurant areas by the pool, one at each end of the pool area (The Cliff Dive Bar and The Mai Tai Bar). The drinks are awesome! You have to try the Passion Mai Tai. At $10 a drink though they can add up quickly. The burgers are very tasty as were the fish tacos. The service was wonderful !!!! Cannot complain at all. The waitresses were very friendly and helpful and were always there just as your drink was ready to be refilled. Spa: I treated my self to the Queen Bee facial, and it was exceptional. I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop touching my face because my skin had never felt so smooth. The Spa has a wonderful atmosphere, very relaxing. I would highly recommend it. The Black Rock Steak and Seafood: We had dinner here on our final night. It took a very long time to be seated as it had started raining and the number of tables were limited when it came to availability. But it was worth the wait. Our waitress was excellent (very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive). For starters, I had the chicken consomm\u00c3\u00a9 with lemongrass which was so delicious, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his salad. We both had the steak, which was prepared perfectly.

Firstly the location, was probably the best out of all of the resorts all along this stretch of beach. Ideally located next to the point/rock into the beach, there was a nightly diving demonstration at sunset off the rock, and was fantastic that you could just swim off the beach with your snorkel and mask and be surrounded by tropical fish only 50-100m in. The beach is also quite nice in this area and great for laying on the sun or going for a swim. The Sheraton in conjunction with their Westin sister resorts provide a shuttle bus service (no additional charge as included in daily resort charge) which takes you on the 5-10 min drive into the township. For those that aren't aware, pretty much all of the main accommodation and resorts are located a few miles out of town....probably too far to walk, so rather than getting a short taxi or maybe a city bus, the free shuttle is a great benefit which is available to only Sheraton and Westin customers. The resort itself had plenty to do, but importantly was a great place to relax. There are a few poolside bars to enjoy, plenty of poolside chairs/lounges (also overlooking the beach which was right next to there as well) and some beautiful settings/lawns. The resort restaraunt was good for the buffet breakfast (which we had included in our package), but could also have our included breakfast at either of the nearby Westin resorts as well (which was nice for a change and different variety). We did have an issue with some equipment noise coming through our room which did impact our sleeping at night, however the resort was good about looking into resolving this and I certainly wouldn't want to impact on what would otherwise be a super review for the resort on the basis of an isolated incident in a single room (I would expect that no other room would have this issue so you should be pretty safe). Was certainly not the cheapest accommodation around, and whilst is an excellent place to stay, you do pay for it. We found the price of the rooms fairly high and the drinks etc at he bar were probably at the higher end (outside the daily happy hours), however I would expect this for a resort like this in such a great location.

The bad, like so many reviewers we were sad to report that the front desk staff was not helpful and in general appeared to be annoyed by us, annoyed by a tourist in Hawaii, go figure. My wife asked what room upgrades were available, she said \"$25 per upgradge\" She didn't tell us what that meant or even offer to show us the different room locations on a map. Maybe she assumed that we had been to the Sheraton Maui several times before. I think the rude front desk people are common in resort areas as weird as it sounds. So despite their lack of information we stuck with the lowest end room. We go to the room, which they didn't tell us how to get there, and we talked around with luggage for ten minutes before a grounds keeper finally helped us to find that it was a ground floor unit, overlooking the lovely maintenance barn with 2 full beds. Wow, I guess this is what you get when you book on orbitz and don't do the room upgrade. I called the front desk and indicated that my wife was pretty upset by the room and they upgraded me to an ocean view room for the low cost of $75 per night, haha only in Hawaii. I was okay with the upgrade fee but was annoyed that despite their very low occupancy (maybe due to the tourism economy being in the tank) they put us in their crappiest room. Sometimes I think hotels look down at guests who book with Orbitz rather than directly through them. The other annoying thing was the food. I have been to Hawaii before and I know food is expensive. I live near the Colorado ski resorts so I know that burgers can be upwards of $15 in those spots. But Sheraton took this way to far. $19 for a burger without cheese and $8 for a 12oz beer in a plastic cup is just too much. Needless to say we chose to dine in other areas in Lahaina town and Kapula where they were not trying to suck every dollar out of you. As I mentioned before, this was the 2nd time we stayed at Sheraton in Hawaii, and probably the last. They have just taken resort town tourist money making too far.

The concierge stated that we would get champagne and strawberries for the inconvenience but that never came.

After requesting ANOTHER room change on our third day, we finally received a king, without an adjoining door and amazing view! The resort offers so many activities and tours which is great when you are visiting, just visit the Guest Services desks to book a wine tour, zip lining, snorkeling, scuba diving, etc. The luau was adequate but I would probably suggest the Royal Lahaina Resort's luau. The scuba and snorkel staff were AMAZING!! If you'd like to have dinner in Lahaina you will have to drive as its a good distance away. There is no laundry facility only laundry services.

Worth every penny!\u201d", "Author": "Islands0821", "ReviewID": "UR123612961", "Content": "Have to start by saying, every day I think back about our amazing honeymoon here! We traveled to Maui for our honeymoon right after our wedding in mid-October 2011. It was always my dream to go to Hawaii for my honeymoon, so when my now husband and I started planning, I kept talking about Hawaii. There were some pricing concerns, though in the end I was told if I could find a comparable price for Hawaii as opposed to where else we were looking, it was a go. Big recommendation: use a travel agent! I found Caroline from Aldine Travel in Saint Louis, Missouri, and she is amazing (more on that later). I'll break the review down by the features/areas: Check-in: ***Key thing to know in Maui*** there is a difference between ocean-view and ocean-front rooms. Anywhere else I wouldn't think twice, but I had read about it enough to investigate. From my understanding, ocean-view means you may need to step out onto the lanai (and maybe turn your neck one way or the way) to see the ocean. Ocean-front means you should be able to see the ocean from the inside of your room. Yes, you pay a premium for ocean-front versus ocean-view but if you came to Hawaii for a view of the ocean, go with ocean-front. So for our check-in... We got the front desk around 10pm Maui time, so 3am Saint Louis time. We were excited to be here and a bit tired after the traveling. We had booked an ocean-front room with a king size bed. They only had double-beds and not in the ocean-front part. Frustrated we tried to talk to them about how we paid for ocean-front and how we requested a king bed and how our travel agent had called that morning to confirm all these details. The person at the front desk in the end put us in an Ohana suite for the night and said to come back in the morning. Ok... so the bellman took our luggage for us, and he was VERY kind to us. We get in the room and I start giggling...it's a suite with a double-beds. Oh well, I look at my husband and ask if he wants the bed on the right or left and laugh. The next morning I call our travel agent, Caroline, right away, and she was so kind and understanding. She got on the phone and five hours later we have the **best best best** room in the entire hotel. It's a suite, ocean-front, and the view belonged in a movie. The Sheraton Maui and Caroline did right by us. Which brings us to... The room: We paid for an ocean-front room, with a request for a king bed. We were given an ocean-front suite with a king bed in building 2 (facing the ocean, not the side part of building 2). Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful! Updated furniture, microwave, fridge, huge walk-in entry closet, murphy bed, full-size sofa, two arm chairs, two flat panel televisions (one in living room part, one in bedroom), safe, nice bedroom closet, great linens, comfortable bed and pillows. You could not hear any neighbors or hallway noise. Bathroom was updated with beautiful vanity area with two sinks, hair dryer, and all the bath amenties you need including aloe for a sunburn! Nice touch for Hawaii. :) There were two showers in the bathroom: one walk-in glass shower and a shower in the bathtub. If you're in a rush, not bad, otherwise we just rinsed our bathing suits in the tub and showered in the walk-in shower. Again, can't say enough about the view, so I posted pictures. You walked in and could immediately see the ocean. The lanai, wow! We had a table and chairs, and a chaise lounge. It was twice the size of the regular room lanai, since our room took up the space of two rooms. Simply perfect. Hotel staff: Overall very friendly and welcoming. Even with the room mix-up they were nice to us and you could tell that the hotel cared about taking care of the issue. They even sent up a bottle of wine and a cheese/cracker/fruit tray with a little note. It was refreshing that a hotel wanted to make sure everything was just right. These were truly professionals working. Also, a nice little touch, I noticed that midday there appeared to be security that would walk the hallways to make sure everything was in order. It was no obtrusive or anything, it honestly made me feel good. Location & Beach: Awesome location! We rented a car and we were really happy we did. The hotel is situated on the end of Ka'anapali Parkway, so you drive all the way down. There wasn't a lot of traffic going past the hotel because of this and gave it the feeling of being more peaceful and quiet. The beach was perfect and had some of the best snorkeling!!! The last day there, we swam with three huge turtles. You're not supposed to touch the turtles as it's a federal regulation, and people were generally good about this. It was an amazing experience. We also think that way in the distance we have seen whales, but we can't say for sure. It makes for a good story either way. :) Because of the Black Rock there are all different kinds of fish that make it their home, so a great array of fish. We even saw some kind of guided night scuba diving, which seemed really cool. We never made it to see the Black Rock diver, so we'll have to do that next time. **Tip** do NOT rent snorkel gear at the hut on the beach by the hotel, it's WAY overpriced. Walk down to Whaler's Village along the beach and you'll find near the restaurants a hut with snorkel gear. At most, we paid $30 a set for the WHOLE week. My husband even got prescription strength goggles without any issue. They need a credit card for deposit and you're all set. There were beach rentals, and we were a little suprised you had to rent a beach chaise lounge, but the beach is public so it makes sense. We were so thrilled we picked to stay in Lahaina. We considered Wailea, and after traveling there for the day to check out the beaches and hotels we were glad we stayed at the Sheraton. Wailea is oppulent and almost over the top in some respects. The beaches are more secluded and there were lots of families with small kids. Lahaina has great food, shops to browse, and a lots of art galleries which we loved. Also, we did a surfing lesson in Lahaina with Maui Wave Riders (highly recommended). Hotel Food: Highly recommend the brunch. They had a great selection of pastries, cold cuts and salmon, shrimp, egg station, waffles/french toast, etc. It was like a great Sunday brunch on the mainland, but you could have it everyday here. We had outdoor seating, as we requested. Yes, there were birds, but they were beautiful and they were there because guests would leave food for them, so it's understandable there are birds. Again, they were beautiful and not obstrusive, it's all part of Hawaii! :) We had burgers one night at the hotel bar since it was late and we had come back from a day-trip to Oahu. Burgers were great, service was awesome, and we played chess in the lounge area. Perfect evening. Pools: A great pool system at this hotel. They all seemed to interconnect and there were great little hide-aways. We found a spot with four lounge chairs, a small waterfall, and a small slide. We enjoyed the privacy and it felt like we had our own pool and slide. There were floating beanbags throughout the pool area which were first-come, first-serve. There was a hot tub, as well. To sum it up: This was the best trip of my life thus far. Not a day goes by where I don't think about Hawaii and our stay here. We were truly impressed and absolutely plan to come back and visit in the future.

The location of the hotel is ideal. It is also next to the black rock which is a great spot to snorkel especially early in the morning. We saw marine turtles and spotted eagle ray. It was simply magic. You also have to jump 7m from the black rock as this is the tradition! The pool area was very large and there were plenty of sunchairs. It was perfect to relax as there was not too much noise from the kids. They also have plenty of beach towels, so you do not have to worry about bringing your own. The rooms were great as well with a partial ocean view and a small balcony. The matresses and beds were very comfy and they were quiet!! What a peaceful stay. The bathroom was convenient and clean! What else do you need? There are 2 main restaurants in the hotel, the \"Black Rock Steak and Seafood\" and \"Dan\". We were really not impressed by the steak and seafood restaurant which is very much over rated. I would not recommend to have dinner there. But Dan was simply excellent.

I loved the property and our room, which was in buiding 6 had an incredible view. I have to say, however, it did not start out that great. We arrived late at night and received a room on the ground floor. Keep in mind, we paid for an Ocean Front Deluxe room, and our view was of the hedge directly in front of the room. Also, it was a ground floor, which meant we couldn't leave the lanaii door open without feeling unsafe. I immediately called the front desk and they did not have a room available until the next day. We simply needed to have our luggage packed, and they would move it to the new room. And that is what they did! The new room was amazing. I quickly recovered from my extreme disappointment.You see, I called several times, after reading reviews, to make sure we had a King Bed. It didn't occur to me that we would be placed in an Ocean Front room without a view of the ocean. Keep this in mind when making your reservation. Also, the next morning they called to ask us to come collect a gift, which was a reusable shopping bag (they called it a beach bag) and a box of Caramacs. We used the bag every time we went shopping. You see, in Maui, they have banned plastic bags, so it was really nice to have a durable bag to carry groceries in. I did not, however, like the \"hard sell\" they gave for a time share. I am on vacation and I want my time to be vacation time. I was polite about this, but she seemed to push just enough to consider it a \"turn off\". So many of the reviews were helpful. I was prepared for the long walk from the room to just about anywhere! However, there was special parking for buiding 6 which was very close and there was always a spot available. Each morning I made the long walk to the Starbucks cart. Trust me, it is a long walk, but very enjoyable, with the views through the breezeways. At the cart you can buy Starbucks coffee. Additionally, they had pastries, fruit and a different breakfast sandwich each day. This is how we started our day, sitting on the lanaii, eating fruit and drinking coffee. It was far less expensive than the breakfast at the hotel, which we did not try. Like I said, the walk to anywhere was quite long, and I had to pass through construction in building 3. You wouldn't know there was construction going on if you didn't pass through it. We loved hanging out by the pool in the afternoon and never had a problem finding a chair. We had drinks and lunch there a couple of times. Be forwarned, it is very expensive, but the drinks we had were good. There are two bars, but only one of them were open at a time, and they had a different lunch menu. Our favorite was the mahi mahi tacos. We enjoyed our stay, the rooms were clean, the service was good and the employees were polite. I knew ahead of time that the prices were high, but it started to take a toll by the end of the trip. Other than a few drinks and lunch by the pool, and coffee at the coffee cart, we took our business outside of the hotel.

Overall we liked it but did not love it. To begin with I used SPG points, I could not decide whether tot stay at the Westin or the Sheraton, ultimately after reading the reviews we stayed at the Sheraton only because they said the rooms are bigger there and we had four in our room. Turns out due to SPG gold status they did upgrade me to a deluxe room which is larger but the location was lacking in building two at the end of the wing. As you have heard this place is BIG, bigger than you can probably imagine. The workout room was a 15 min walk (no lie), which required a map, compass and flashlight to find from our room at the other end of the resort. ! We also ended up walking up five flights of stairs everytime we went anywhere because the elevator was so far from our room. I suppose we got our exercise which is not a bad thing but be aware. The pool was cold as many people have commented, really cold, so very few people went in, mainly young kids. The towel card system was a little of a pain but no big deal. Chairs were at a premium, we went down around 8am to play tennis and staked our claim then, if you waited you were out of luck. The tennis is good deal by the way; $60 per couple for four days all access and attached to the resort- take advantage if you play. Service was good around the pool overall and happy hour at the Cliff Dive Bar was a good deal with mixed drinks and beer for $4 each. We only eat a few snacks at the hotel becuase the prices were high but Whalers Village has great options in all price ranges a short walk away. We also stayed at the Grand Wailia prior to the Sheraton on the same trip, not a fair comparison I know but OMG is that place nice!

Self-parking was free while we stayed there (and free valet for the first night). Across the street you got an ok golf course and Whalers Village is only a very short stroll away. For runners you can run along the beach south through Lahaina and further for up to 7 miles each way and for cyclists this is right along the West Maui loop (and West Maui Cycles is only 5, 6 blocks away in case you want to rent...) The Spa was pricey but good. The only downside is the cost of various add-ons: it's not exactly clear what additional value the $30/day resort fee provides and as other reviewers have noted renting a simple beach chair and an umbrella will cost anywhere between an arm, a leg and a kidney.

Angelica at the front desk did a great job working with us, and we ended up in a suite in building 5, there was a fee for the upgrade, but the room was beautiful, powder room, living and dining room king size bedroom with a very large bathroom and a huge lanai. It was beautiful, the only problem was it looked out over the North coast and was not Oceanfront, if it did we would have had to move in ( wow are we spoiled only a view of the Northcoast, but we wanted oceanfront and that is what we recieved).

The room we had was 4408 and the view was nice - overlooking the pool area and had a view of the beach and ocean, but since it is billed as an oceanfront room - it was not - more of an oceanview room for it did not directly face the ocean. The concierge desk staff were efficient and nice when booking a tour we wanted. Well that about covers the good part. The room we had was small - I mean come on - this is a resort? The room was so small that the ice bucket and glasses are kept in the closet on top of the safe - that is just not right. There was only one chair in the room besides the one at the desk / entertainment center. There was not a microwave in this room. The only place to put your luggage was either on the bed or on the floor if you had more than one piece of luggage open at a time. The bathroom was small - only room for one person at a time - which normally is not a problem except there is no space outside the bathroom where another can get ready at the same time. As other reviews have said, be prepared to walk and find your way through elevators and breezeways to get to where you want (which is somewhat expected in a large resort). The parking area near the tennis courts is okay, but a number of the spaces are small and you will find yourself backing up and back to get centered between the lines. The lanai was spacious, but as for me not private enough - you can easily see and be seen from the balconies of the adjoining rooms.

They left us a message early in the morning the next day that they had our new room ready, and to leave our stuff for them to move around 11-12 o'clock. They moved everything and gave us a free upgrade to an oceanview room in building 4, room 4401. We had an amazing view!!! I was so happy! The hotel itself is amazing! The beach area is also considered one of the best on Kaanapali beach, and I can see why. It's got a great spot for snorkeling and the view of black rock in itself is beautiful! It's a short walk to Whalers village where we ate everyday for lunch and dinner. One of the great things about this hotel (or maybe it's just the time we went. Dec 8-15) is that it was not at all crowded. There was absolutely no trouble getting a lounge chair at any time of the day! If you go to the pool area around 9:00, you can pretty much find any space you want available. That was a bonus! Now, the hotel restaurants! They have definitely failed us! The first meal we tried was at the pool area (the cliff dive, I believe). Our waitress was so rude! Even though we were ordering TO GO so that we can eat by the pool. She was not the least bit friendly, and I cannot understand why after I have been beyond nice and polite to her! I figure it's because we are a lot younger than her. The food there was SOOOO overpriced and sooooo not good!!! It was very bland. I have never had nasty mahi mahi, and let me tell you, this was not good fish! We were upset because we spent $50 on a mahi mahi sandwich, and a burger for my husband. No drinks were even ordered! The next restaurant that we decided to try for my birthday was the black rock. It was on the fancier and pricier side. I was also very upset about this meal. I ordered a steak, since it is a fish and steak house. I ordered it medium well and it was literally red inside! It didn't taste raw, but it was not made the way I ordered it. The food there was also very bland with no taste! I can cook 10 times better than that and I don't consider myself a good cook. We also happened to find a beetle crawling around us in the restaurant which was a big turn off for me. I know and understand that we are in a tropical place and all, but this was the \"inside\" part of the restaurant. My advice is to eat at Whalers village. My favorite lunch spot is the hula grill. The food at those restaurants is cheap and tasty! I also advise you to buy your own alcohol or drinks at the nearest supermarket and bring with you to the pool area. We did that everyday and I feel like we saved so much money! Overall, I loved the hotel grounds as well as the pool and beach area. The rooms are nice and I suggest building 4 for your room. The only thing I didn't like are the restaurants at the hotel and I wish the staff can lighten up a bit. They're not too friendly, but they did give us an upgrade.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place, amazing holiday\u201d", "Author": "h0liday-all-the-time", "ReviewID": "UR121911174", "Content": "Everything was well taken care of at this hotel.

The property is very nice and the location is unbeatable for the Ka'anapali area. The hotel is located on a great stretch of Ka'anapali Beach right on Black Rock which offers beautiful snorkeling/scuba diving right in front of the hotel. It is also less than a 5 minute walk to Whaler's Village shopping and dining center which is also very convenient. The hotel is well kept and the rooms are not fancy but are updated and quite comfortable. Every evening the cliff jumpers light torches on black rock and jump off into the water. Its nothing crazy but a nice little touch that makes you feel connected to a forgotten true Hawaiian spirit. Our room upon check-in was the last room along Black Rock and had a great view but awkward layout. The cable didn't work and they couldn't fix it so they moved us to a new room in which they upgraded us to a Jr. Suite. The room was huge and was really nice. The staff did a great job to make up for the inconvenience and we were very happy with their assistance. I am a Starwood Platinum member so that may have helped out with getting a room upgrade but it was very nice of them to offer an upgrade without me having to ask for it. Sometimes the large resorts do not recognize Platinum status as much as more business-travel oriented hotels but this resort was very accommodating. The only negative, and this is really picking here, is that the pool is kind of an awkward layout. It is quite narrow in places and feels a bit small despite its enormous length from end-to-end. There is plenty of room on the other side for a second pool and it would be nice to see even a smaller, adults only pool as main pool area can seem a bit crowded and overrun with energetic kids. Overall I would highly recommend this property for those looking for a true mega-resort feel in the heart of Ka'anapali. The property has tons of energy and really is a great location. The hotel is great for families with children both older and younger as there is no shortage of activities. It is also great for those who like the feel of being in a larger resort town as it is merely minutes away from Lahaina and there are tons of activities, shops, and restaurants in the area. For those looking for a quieter, romantic getaway I would say that this resort is not exactly geared towards you.

Our personal experiences begin here. We booked our room through the Sheraton website...and to those of you that got the run around about two beds/king/moving rooms maybe booking directly through their website did the trick as opposed to Expedia, etc. Yes, we received the \"you can upgrade for $$\", when we declined their first offer to upgrade we received a lower priced upgrade offer which we took for a beautiful oceanfront room in Building 6. When we arrived our room was not ready, so we were given complimentary drink tickets and a food voucher. We had cold items in our car, so the valet told us they had a cooler. When we returned from our free drinks, we found our cold items in a regular plastic tote. Not ok...Strike One. Once in our room, which was very nice, clean, upgraded, complete with coffee maker and refrigerator we moved in. Great maid service the first day.....she rocked. Getting to the room the first day was crazy...up and down in elevators. After a few days, it was routine, however, you'd better remember everything you need, it's a journey from one place to the other. Strike 2 - We went to book the luau....well, low and behold \"I am sorry ma'am but that show is dark this week...\" Really, not one person mentioned that at check in or prior to check in via e-mail or mail...and the conciere lady didn't give a **** when I told her that would have been nice to know prior to or at check in. We actually had cancelled reservations at the Hyatt to attend the one at the Sheraton only to find out that it was dark this week. Sheraton Maui....tell people when they check in what's not happening at your resort for the length of their stay....you'd think that might be prudent. Otherwise, most of the staff have been very nice. Your front desk, valet and conciere staff were the ones that were the least friendly...compared to the Cliff Dive Bar staff and the maid service staff that were so personable and enjoyable. The deeper you get into to the resort, the nicer the people are. Grounds are beautiful....prices are high....drinks are expensive but the view is worth the price.

The pool is lovely, never had an issue with getting a sunbed. We swam with the turtles at black rock, which was just amazing! We found the best time to go down was about 3pm and they were literally just off the shore. The only other issue we had was after we checked out, we had an invoice to state our room and all charges were paid for - they had accidentally charged drinks to our room on the invoice, but it had been cancelled off. When we got home we found that they had charged our credit card for this drinks and had not refunded it - we had a few emails back and forth before the situation was resolved.

We booked a deluxe oceanfront room for 5 nights (Nov 19th - 24th) and was stationed in building #6 on the second floor by the corner where you are the closest to black rock and where all the snorkelling occurs. The cliff dive is to the left of your balcony. The room was very spacious, the bed was comfortable, the view outstanding and the bathroom had a separate toilet room. It had all the amenities of a 5 star resort. I know it is an older resort (around the 30 year mark) but they do a very good job of maintaining all those acres and keeping it exceptionally clean. It is a very large property so expect to do some walking. The only area that could use some updating or repairing would be the doors to the guest rooms. They need a new sweep and a paint job. When we return I would request a room in building #4 or #5. Although the rooms and view are fantastic in #6, and you have ample parking just a few hundred feet away, it was quite a chore to go back to your room if you forgot something. You have to use an elevator to go up to the 8th floor in building #5 and then walk down a hall to get onto another elevator to bring you back to the 3rd floor so you can get to the ramp to get to your building and room. Very confusing for the first day or so. Not conducive to the elderly or people with mobility issues. Keep that in mind! Check-in was courteous and quick. It was amazing as we figured we would have to wait a while before checking in. Our room was ready and I got exactly what we had reserved. We didn't have to wait at all. Actually, we really didn't have to wait for much even when the hotel was very busy as they were hosting several university teams for a basketball tournament. Pool area and beach were amazing. The water and beach are probably the best on Kaanapali compared to the others. We walked it everyday and it was the most calm right infront of the hotel. Snorkelling was an added bonus just off the beach. The drinks were on the high side at the pool bar (avg. $10 or more) so it was not conducive to having too many. It would have been nice to have a happy hour! The buffet was also included in our rate and it was the best by far compared to the other islands we stayed at during our 2 week vacation. Great fruits, well set-up and the food was kept cold to keep up with proper health food standards. It is also great having the boardwalk just in front of the hotel for the morning walk or a short trip to Whalers Village. We did not eat dinner at the hotel as we had made arrangements at the Lahaina Grill, Hula Grill and the Old Lahaina Luau (all very good). All I can say is that our experience was very positive and we had absolutely no complaints about this resort. We would return in a heart beat!! I hope you will be as satisfied as we were!!!

We also enjoyed spending time at the pool each day and love the lazy-river type of set up. The only thing we found disappointing is that since our trip last year they have converted a number of the pool chairs into rental lounges that you have to pay to use. The entire time we were there we never saw anyone actually rent these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgraded\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chairs around the pool. At a resort where guests are paying a premium and resort fee on top of the daily room fee, it is disappointing to see the resort nickel-and-dime customers with things like that. We didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants, so I cannot comment on the food quality. Though, we did peek at the menu at Black Rock and it was very pricey, and you are definitely paying for the convenience of not having to leave the hotel. We spent time exploring all over the island, so ate most of our meals in Lahaina or elsewhere. If you are looking for a great meal no too far away, I would recommend Tropica in the Westin. We had an amazing meal there and it is very close - just down the beach walk to the south (they also have a fantastic happy hour!). We also spent a lot of time running and walking up and down the beach walk from the Sheraton. Although there are a number of other nice resorts in the area, the Sheraton really does have the ideal location and beautiful grounds. It is a great place for couples looking for a quieter, relaxing getaway. We highly recommend the Sheraton Maui!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmingville, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest location & hotel on Kaanapli Beach\u201d", "Author": "LaurelMc", "ReviewID": "UR120890916", "Content": "We stayed 6 nights in November 2011 after staying at the Hyatt in October 2010, and we definitely prefer the Sheraton.

While we only paid the daily \"resort fee\" of $26 for the room, I'm going to review this as if we paid the standard rates advertised on your typical travel sites. First of all, the location of the resort is outstanding if you want to stay on one of the best beaches in Maui (Kaanapali) and enjoy excellent snorkeling (Black Rock). When you stay at the resort, you have the option of lounging by the pool or bringing a towel out onto the sand....whatever you prefer. And the snorkeling at Black Rock is fantastic for all skill levels. Of course, it can get a bit crowded, but never too bad. The pool area is also very nice and well kept with plenty of lounge chairs in both sun and shade. Their shallow pool seems to go on for miles with little grottos and channels along the way. We don't have kids, but I'd guess that they'd love the pool area. The shops and restaurants at Whalers village are also a short, pleasant walk down the paved path. So five stars for the location, but the real detractor for this resort is room quality. The decor is somewhat dated and the bathrooms are in need of repair; our bathroom had cracked tiles, countertops separating from walls, stains on the walls, etc. It was perfectly usable, just not in great condition. They aren't terrible, but for the price that they charge for rooms ($200 and up per night), I expect more. The bed was comfortable enough but the carpet was also dated and the \"lanai\" was barely big enough to stand on; let alone fit a chair on. Our room had a \"partial\" ocean view of North Kaanapali but also overlooked the tennis courts, parking lot and service area. As we walked through the resort, there are some sections where rooms are being renovated so the Sheraton is probably undergoing an upgrade and clearly there are some rooms with some simply amazing ocean views....but I'm sure they are expensive. The other thing to note is that you'll likely need to pay a $26 dollar per day \"resort fee\", which allows you to park your car and gets you some free wireless in designated areas like the lobby. You have to pay for wireless in your room. The resort itself is very large and it can easily take you 15 minutes to walk from your room to the car so if you are bringing a lot of gear, drop it off at the valet first. Again, location is outstanding, the grounds are nice and well kept but the basis of my review and rating is based on cost of rooms compared to quality. You can easily go North 5 minutes and find a 1 bed remodeled condo with full kitchen, laundry, ocean view etc...but some people like the resort experience more than the condo experience.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNickel & Dime Resort & Spa\u201d", "Author": "MidwestBoy", "ReviewID": "UR120791355", "Content": "First the good... the hotel room was very clean.

Overall I was definitely happy with the quality of the room and resort. The property is on a very nice beach and although I didn't use the pool, it was nicely laid out and looked like fun - especially for kids. Now the bad... do your own research before you come because the front desk does a terrible job explaining the layout, perks, and other options of the hotel (like the free shuttle that takes you down to Lahaina's Front St shopping area). It wasn't until our last day that we saw the list of activities that they featured everyday. Also, there is a $25/day charge (not optional) that covers parking and internet. We stayed in bldg 4 which ended up being about a mile walk to the parking structure (seriously). The biggest rip-off in my opinion was the $45/day rental fee (for the beach) for either a set of cabana chairs or for a set of beach chairs and umbrella. Lastly, the most ridiculous charge that they told us about was a $4 charge to have wine glasses delivered to our room.

I was torn between the Hyatt and the Sheraton for my honeymoon. I chose the Sheraton because of the better beach. So many reviews had warned of the run-around you get during check-in, but I felt confident that I could navigate that issue. Well, many weeks later after wedding planning, the wedding itself, and the long day of travel to get to Hawaii, I had forgotten all about the check-in games that I had read about. After waiting at the front desk while the clerk seemingly frantically sought for a room, I was told there no Deluxe Ocean Front kings available that I had booked, and I would have to accept their free \"upgrade\" to a room with Double beds right next to the pool bathroom. This was the first night of my honeymoon and I was not happy. They also made me an offer to upgrade for another $100 per night to a room with a King bed but still not as good as the room I booked (bldg 2 instead of the bldg 5/6 for ocean front). And as a privilege of receiving this \"special rate\" I had to commit to staying in that room all week. Then all of the TripAdvisor comments started coming back to me. I declined their high priced \"upgrade\" and took their free \"upgrade\" of double beds. I went to the bell stand and grabbed a luggage rack to unload the car. But I was toldthat I was not allowed to use it (even though they had 4 unused ones just sitting there). So my wife and I struggled carrying all our bags to the room. We got to the room, trying to relax into the Aloha spirit. Suddenly the drills and hammers began pounding away on the room directly upstairs. I called the front desk and there was no more drilling or hammering that day, but I still heard sanding and scraping through the remainder of the day. Anyway, the next day we were supposed to move to our new room between 1 and 3. They were to call us when it was ready. After no call, I arrived at the front desk at 4 and they still did not have a room ready. Remembering how long it took the first day, I asked for some drink coupons and told them to call me when they found an available room of the type that I had reserved. An hour later, still no call I went back to the desk. Finally a room. It was fantastic. It was twice as nice as the free upgrade and about the same as the $100 upgrade but much better views. It's a shame that Sheraton overbooks these rooms and plays the juggling act at check in. It puts an unfair burden on the front desk personnel and frustrates customers. I will definitely not be staying at this hotel again.

There are already many detailed reviews, so I will try to add only a few things that might be additionally helpful to others considering this resort. I will keep my comments to the resort only, and not include outside activities. The Property and Grounds: The property is even more beautiful than the pictures represent - it is immaculate and simply gorgeous. The swimming pool was very clean and refreshing, and we loved floating on the bean bag chairs. I enjoyed having the \"drink of the day\" by the pool in the plastic souvenir cup. The beach is also very nice and not too crowded, but without shade or chairs unless you rent them. The snorkeling was terrific. We rented snorkel gear for $8 for an hour. This was perfect for us, and although there were quite a few people in the water, we saw many colorful fish and a large turtle right near the shoreline. Another guest mentioned that he was able to enjoy the fish without any snorkel gear at all, and had a turtle bump into him while standing in the water! The Service: From the moment we arrived, all staff were welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The woman at the front desk was very professional and helped accommodate our request for a room with a slightly larger balcony. The gift store saleswoman was always friendly and helpful with locating necessary (forgotten) items and a few souvenirs. The waiters and waitresses by the pool were terrific, although apparently short-staffed at times near the end of our visit. We became addicted to the complimentary snack mix with our drinks and found the birds entertaining as they helpfully cleaned up stray bits. The Room: We are fairly certain our room must have been newly renovated as it appeared to be in perfect condition. I had read that the rooms are \"outdated\" and in need of renovation, but we were very pleased with ours. It wasn't overly elegant but was simply very neat and clean. Housekeeping came each day and replaced the dirty towels we left out and made the bed. You can request the linens to be changed more frequently, but we were pleased with just the basics. While we were there, construction began on the floor below us, but we were not bothered by the noise. The room directly below ours was being worked on, but the workers kept the noise between appropriate hours of approximately 9 am and 3-4 pm. To be fair, we weren't in our room all that much except to sleep, so it might be more bothersome to others who might spend more time in the room. I at first requested building 4 or 6 when we checked in, based on these tripadvisor reviews. We ended up in building 3 which we would probably request again! The location and view were outstanding. I debated whether I even wanted to share this information as it could be better kept as a secret! We also talked with other guests who were very happy with building 2, which I had read was not so great. The bottom line is that any of the rooms with an ocean view should be great, and the details are likely just personal preference. A worker came by one afternoon to work on our wifi, which was already working perfectly. It appears that management is listening to the comments about room updating and lack of wireless internet service. There were active measures being taken while we were there to address these issues and we had no complaints. Restaurants and bars: We ate at the Cliff Dive pool bar the first night and enjoyed the atmosphere and live music. The food wasn't terrific, but not awful either. We had nachos by the pool one day and again it wasn't worth repeating. We were happy to enjoy the drinks and snack mix, and go to off-site restaurants in the evening that I had researched and had reservations in place. We didn't try the restaurants at the resort based on other comments here. We also opted to not have the buffet breakfast, again based on other travelers' comments. The first morning we purchased coffee, banana and yogurt from the Starbucks cart for $20. This seemed a bit expensive, so we stocked up on fruit and yogurt from the nearby ABC store in Whaler's Village. The fitness center seemed to have plenty of treadmills and other equipment - there were 2 treadmills actually out on the breezeway where one could run while gazing at the amazing view. We ended up walking each morning along the entire Kaanapali beach walk, which was enough exercise for us. I would recommend doing this earlier than later, as other joggers and walkers begin to crowd the walkway soon after 7 a.m. We also enjoyed walking back to the Sheraton along the beach at night following dinner. We loved the live music at the Cliff Dive bar during happy hour, and had fun watching a wedding reception in the middle of the grounds one evening. It wrapped up early and wasn't disruptive or overly noisy. As other reviewers have already stated, the Sheraton seems to be quite a step above all of the other hotels and resorts in this area. We stopped by the Ritz Carlton for comparison, and we still preferred the Sheraton Maui Resort. The pool at the Ritz did seem amazing, but in general the location and atmosphere of the Sheraton is much better. I have only one complaint: There are a number of \"special chairs\" with canopies around the edge of the pool that can only be rented. I never inquired about the rental cost, but it did irritate me that prime space was reserved for these chairs that were rarely (if ever) used while guests were crowded together in rows behind them. I would suggest either providing all chairs of this quality for no extra charge, or removing them entirely. There were cabanas for rent in other areas with views of the lawn and ocean, which seemed fine and worth the extra cost. This is only my opinion, but I think management should reconsider this practice.", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDefinitely not the aloha spirit!\u201d", "Author": "Fussey1", "ReviewID": "UR120426738", "Content": "Arrived late in the evening Nov 6 booked for a king bed only to find we will be getting double beds.

October was a perfect time to do as it was not so crowded! When we arrived, check in was very quick and easy. We did not ask for any upgrades as we had booked a Partial Ocean View and we aren't picky on rooms but when they found out we were Starwood members they offered us the \"best room on the property\" a Deluxe Ocean View Suite in the corner of Building 6 overlooking Black Rock for a very low rate. We stayed in that room for 3 days then they moved us over to a room a few doors down that was the same view without the \"Suite\" part of it. Amazing!! Building 6 was great as we had our own private parking lot so it was easy to get in and out. To get to the pool and beach it was quite a trek involving 3 different elevators but it was worth it for that view! They were doing the room renovations when we were there so lots of moving trucks and furniture in the parking lot but didnt bother us and we did not here anything. Also I read in the reviews that Wifi did not work in the rooms, only the lobby but it worked for us right away in both our rooms, no problem! Pool was fantastic and not crowded at all! The beach was also very nice, lots of snorkelers at Black Rock which we also snorkeled at. It was nice to have our Hotel right there and to not have to trek it down there from some of the other hotels on the parkway. We had the breakfast buffet one day, Black Rock dinner one night, and ate at the Cliff Dive bar but overall we went out to eat at Whalers Village or drove down to Lahaina. We took the shuttle once but it was extremely crowded going back and not everyone would fit on the bus. Especially the pickup after the Luau gets out around 8pm. We got out to go to Lahaina and no way would everyone fit on and the shuttle only comes once an hour for pick up. Easier to drive or take a taxi in my opinion.

Make sure you don't go in thinking that you are for sure going to get a free upgrade because you won't!!! Both the rooms we were in were very run down and in a desperate need for a make over. The cabinet that housed the refrigerator in both the rooms were chipped and looked horrible. This is not a 4 star property! However, it suited my needs for the week. The staff were nice but I did have a communication problem with one lady behind the front desk.

We stayed only on Kaanapali beach during our Maui trip, at both the Westin hotel and the Sheraton hotel. The Sheraton was a lot better. If you like to snorkel like I do, you'll see why. Black Rock is right where the Sheraton property is and I snorkelled pretty much everyday there and whenever I did, I would see about 5-8 sea turtles within 45 minutes. I got so close to so many (inches away) and I just love being in the water with them. And, very unexpectedly I also saw spotted eagle rays on my last snorkel adventure that trip right at Black Rock also. If you're into scuba diving they have scuba diving at Black Rock. I took my first scuba diving lesson there and it was lots of fun. We booked the scuba lesson through the Sheraton hotel directly and you may chose to read my review on it here: http://karen-is-here.blogspot.com/2011/09/my-first-scuba-diving-experience-in.html They also do night dives if you're into that. Sooo....we did book a premiere snorkel trip with a company called the Teralani. Save yourself the money and don't book it. The snorkelling at Black Rock is a whole lot better than the spots the Teralani took us too, plus its at the convenience of your hotel if you're staying at the Sheraton Black Rock (not to mention you save $$ not having to go with the Teralani or any other company offering snorkelling excursions) if you book with the Sheraton Black Rock, try to stay in building 6 if you want to be closest to the ocean view. We had an ocean view room and our balcony was facing right onto Black Rock. It was really private too so we had a lot more privacy than we did at the Westin since outside our balcony at the Westin is all the shopping from Whaler's Village. So, what's neat about building 6 ocean view rooms? We saw the best Maui sunsets on the privacy of our balcony. I included pictures of the sunsets I took from our balcony. It was just so beautiful. I was actually taken on a sunset cruise with the Teralani as well and honestly, the sunset cruise was nothing to cry home about if you're at the Sheraton Black Rock with an ocean view. I wouldn't recommend the sunset cruise if you have the ocean view room. Also, I saw sea turtles in the ocean right from our balcony at the Sheraton! Yay! Plus, the Sheraton has this torch lighting ceremony and Cliff Dive every early evening. If you had the kind of room we did, you could see the Cliff Dive from your balcony. But it's nice to see the torch lighting ceremony once closer in person on the beach of the Sheraton. if you chose to snorkel at the Sheraton Black Rock, you can rent snorkel gear at the Sheraton but it's overpriced and worst off, you have to return it by 5 pm the same day. If you have a car I highly suggest renting your gear at Maui Dive Shop (you could also grab a cab). There are a few locations and there was one within a few minutes drive from the Sheraton. The gear was newer, cleaner, and you can rent the snorkel gear for one week for the same price as one day with the Sheraton. They also have scuba gear rental at Maui Dive Shop. Hmmm...what else? Oh as for the service at the resort, well...I'm not sure why they really charge you the $25 resort fee/day. The service was not bad but it wasn't exceptional. We did have one mishap though One day the maid did not make up our room because she knocked on our door in the morning while we were still sleeping, so we asked her to come back later. When she came back 1.5 -2 hours later we were just busy in the room and asked if she could come back a bit later like in an hour. I guess she had a bad day or something because all we heard her say was \"(insert profanity)\" aloud through the door. My boyfriend and I were really shocked at such a rude response from the maid so we called front desk about it and they awarded my boyfriend some starwood points as a compensation for the misunderstanding....other than that, I believe that was the only mishap we had at the hotel. It certainly hasn't stopped us from wanting to go back to the Sheraton Maui Resort :)", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cvery relaxing resort with a great location\u201d", "Author": "Jasmans", "ReviewID": "UR119769554", "Content": "I stayed at this resort hotel for seven nights in October 2011.

The room was a decent size with a nice sofa and chairs to relax. The bathroom was quite nice with a walk in shower and separate tub along with dual sink vanity. The room came with a tiny dorm fridge and tiny microwave, both worked fine. I did see some other regular rooms in this resort and they ranged from very nicely upgraded to god awful. The only bad thing in the Suite was the A/C system had a motion detector on it. At night while sleeping (not moving) the A/C system would not run. This led to a warm room with stale air to try to sleep in. And if that is not bad enough, the door for murphy bed would completely block the A/C unit, so if you used the murphy bed you were guanteed to not have any A/C in the room at night. Starwood really needs to remove these motion detectors from their properties. The resort was completely sold out for the week, but the beach and pool did not seem overly crowded. You could still get two lounge chairs poolside at 10am. The resort is on the nicest area of Kanapali beach. The beach is very wide and deep with lots of nice sand. The water gets deep very quickly off the beach, but this makes for some great snorkeling. The blackrock at the end of the beach is very unique. It is quite fun to climb up and jump or dive off, or just fun to watch other people try it. The resort was very clean and well maintained, I did not notice anything broken my entire time.

The room (deluxe ocean view, 4 floor in the Hale Lahaina building) was amazing, the location was absolutely perfect, the hotel staff were genuinely friendly and extremely helpful. I had read some comments about the staff not being friendly there, but I never once saw anything other than friendly and helpful service. This hotel is by far the best one I have ever stayed at! Our expectations were exceeded in every way. If I was to say anything on the negative side, it would be that the price of the food and drinks at the hotel - and especially at the Starbucks that is located on-site - is pretty high. (I mean, $8.50 for two grande coffees, come one). My recommendation would be to either walk to Whaler's village or simply take the convenient shuttle service offered by the hotel and find something to eat in Lahaina. That said, we did eat at the hotel once and the food was good...good but pricey. The hotel has a nice little shop on site called Lamont's that offers reasonably priced sundries and souvenirs - a nice touch.

Our room was clean, modern and well decorated. The view from our balcony was nothing but ocean, with the quiet island of Molokai off in the distance. It felt very isolated and relaxing. My only complaint with our room location was that it was quite a haul to get to the pool or lobby, with 4 separate elevator rides! However, there was a private parking lot for our building, just 1 short elevator ride away. There was never any shortage of chairs at the pool, and no shortage of beach space either. There is absolutely no need to rush down in the morning, which is so nice when you are on vacation! Poolside drinks and food are very expensive, and you are not allowed to bring your own down from your room. The poolside bars do offer happy hour specials though. We were a bit disappointed how late things open up around the pool, and how early they shut down. We had fallen in love with Mai Tais during our stay in Honolulu, and were excited to check out the poolside Mai Tai bar after we checked in. However they had already closed for the evening, at 5:00 pm! Overall things shut down much earlier in Maui though, as compared to Honolulu. That was a bit of an adjustment for us! The Whaler's Village is just a short beachside walk away (there is a pathway), and there is quite a bit to do there at nighttime. The Sheraton also provides a free shuttle to Lahaina, that runs until 10:00 at night, so we took advantage of that a few nights, there are several \"hip\" bars, restaurants & shops worth checking out down there. Overall, we really truly enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Maui. It far exceeded our expecations, and was the perfect setting for our perfect honeymoon!", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "Clare S", "ReviewID": "UR119328094", "Content": "We stayed in the Sheraton Maui on our honeymoon in January 2010. It was our first time to Hawaii and in our taxi on the way to the hotel (about 40 mins by taxi) we were greeted by the most amazing sunset. It was a sign of things to come! We arrived at the Sheraton just after sunset - a perfect time to arrive at this hotel. It was lit up with the warm inviting light of the tiki lamps and we were greeted on arrival with garlands of flowers. The hotel upgraded us to an Ocean Front room (we had booked ocean view). Our room was beautiful with stunning views form the balcony of the Black Rock, the sea and the lagoon pools and bar. The hotel's facilities are beautiful, and this hotel is very plush and exceptionally clean. The staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. It is nice and quiet - the bars do close early at 11:00, so if you want a drink later than this you have to head to Lahaina. Lahaina is about a 15 minute ride away, but there is a shuttle bus which is free which runs hourly. We used this a number of times, but a taxi is only around $10-15. The upside of the bars shutting early is that it is very quiet and peaceful at night. There were some families in this hotel but there was a nice balance. I would say it suits couples and families and neither intrude on the other (and I don't normally like hotels where there are children!) The restaurants in the hotel are good. There is a nice range of food and it is all done well. I have to say it is not exceptional though and it is on the pricey side. Especially Tepanyaki Dan's, which is very expensive and feels like it is all over very quickly! However, this is Hawaii - it's not cheap anywhere!!! The beach is beautiful and the Black Rock is perfect for snorkelling. Word of warning though - sometimes the waves get very powerful we had an \"incident\" on the last day of our stay, culminating in my husband being tossed by a wave and breaking his hip. We thought that my husband had been very unlucky until we were told by a local doctor that the beach is well known for accidents due to the shelving sand. Do not let this put you off though - most of the time the waves were not that big, and sometimes it was very calm. Just have a healthy respect for the sea when the waves get big (there may have been an element of over-confidence in my husband's case ;-)) Anyway - the hotel staff were amazing and really supported us as my husband was in hospital for a week and then he had to recuperate for a few days at the hotel before we could go home. The hotel was near capacity but they found us a room with disabled facilities and really looked after us for our unplanned extended stay. They also sent us a card and a big bag of goodies to cheer us up. All in all a very memorable honeymoon, but for the right reasons. The Sheraton played a pivotal part in making our experience of Maui so wonderful and in softening the blow of the unfortunate incident at the end of the trip.", "Date": "October 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Longmont, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cHeavenly Memories\u201d", "Author": "ugadog", "ReviewID": "UR119206042", "Content": "We inhabited the Sheraton Maui for four glorious nights and 5 days in mid-September for our 25th wedding anniversary celebration. We had stayed at neighboring hotels before and endured the long, arduous hike to snorkel at Black Rock, but we had never actually stayed at the Sheraton. Our ocean front room on the second floor was simply perfect. The view over the pool area to the beach, with the island of Lanai across the channel was spectacular. The location, just a few steps away from the pool, restaurants and lobby, offered the ultimate in convenience, as we struggled each day to perform very large quantities of nothing. The room, amenities, staff, and activities of the resort all exceeded our expectations. Valet parking is included in the first night stay. After that, for $5.12 extra you can continue the valet service. Our aging legs advised us to embrace this small sacrifice to avoid future pain and suffering, so we happily obliged. The pool was an enjoyable adventure and we were able to find shade under the umbrellas and palm trees every day, even the time we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive until almost noon (1 lonely palm tree was nicely waiting for our gratification). Of course, as the day progressed, the chairs had to be migrated opposite to the movement of the sun to maintain a seamless canopy over all body parts. If you are celebrating a significant event (or insignificant event for that matter), order a drink in a whole pineapple. In addition to the fantasy appearance and savory taste of the drink, it is certain to elicit comments and conversations from other hotel guests. Order it early in the day, as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whole\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pineapple is ironically a scarce commodity in a Hawaiian resort \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 the honeymooners next to us got the last ones in existence on our first pool visit. Unfortunately, the snorkeling at Black Rock was not nearly as good as we had remembered 10-15 years ago. As I recall there was a vendor selling little bags of fish food to snorkelers that may have contributed (you really think?) to the abundance of fish at that time. However, there were still sufficient turtles, fish and coral to make the effort worthwhile (well, aside from the leg cramps that we both enjoyed in the water and later at night). As with most upper end Hawaiian resorts, the restaurants were very good, but outrageously priced. We did the $29 breakfast buffet a couple of days and then drove down to Cane and Taro at Whalers Village for a more reasonable breakfast price tag the other days. Yes, Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village is just a short 5-10 minute walk along the beach. In fact, the concierge at the pool gave us a very perplexed look when we booked a UFO Parasail excursion and then refused to accept his suggestion that we walk to Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village for the lift off. However, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t rent the red Mustang convertible to let it sit in the parking lot. Furthermore, I defer again to the almighty ruler of the body, the cramping legs, which again demanded our obedience.

To us, having that view makes a huge difference in our enjoyment of this hotel. The rooms are plenty nice, not extravagant though. Bathrooms are spacious. I think there might be other areas of the hotel that would feel more crowded at peak times of the year. I was a little disappointed that our valet forgot the lei greeting, but no big deal. The check-in process went smoothly and quickly, and the lobby has such amazing views and fresh air that you hardly notice the time passing. Maybe it's the euphoria of arriving in Maui and hearing Hawaiian music playing that makes it special! We like building #6 also because you can self park through a gate using your room key, and not have to worry about tipping the valet every time you need your car. This is important to us because we stay on the go, sight seeing, hiking, dining out, and exploring. We usually take time to enjoy the pool, which is very nice and spacious. The beach is wonderful and the water is clear. We also enjoyed the adjacent beach just to the north, off the Royal Ka'anapali golf course and just south of Kahekili Beach Park and the Royal Lahaina Resort. The sand was very steep, going to the water, but the water was very enjoyable and uncrowded. Ka'anapali is a great section of West Maui, and we enjoy the proximity to Whaler's Village for shopping, as well as downtown Lahaina.

Had a wonderful time, it really is the best hotel on the beach, right up against Black Rock with some great snorkeling. We stayed in Building 6 above the Rock with view of Molokai, which was relaxing and quiet. Check-in. We got there at 2:30 for a 3:00 check in. Not a problem, we went to the bar and had a couple cocktails and left my cell phone number with the front desk clerk. At 3:30 we went up to the desk, I noticed my number had been crossed out and yet I never got a call. He said 10-15 minutes so we walked around the grounds. At 4:00 came back and they were doing a shift change. He left without saying anything to us. I had to find someone else and they said FIVE more minutes. On the couple other occasions I had to talk to the front desk I found that they weren't overly friendly and just going through the motions. But you don't deal with them everyday and I wasn't going to let them ruin my vacation, just a disappointment. We did the breakfast plan (tip/tax included), excellent food. Had dinner one night at the restaurant and it was great. Service at the restaurant was always superb. Inside Bar area. Bleh. Not inviting at all. Usually empty, we only went once. The bartender was more interested in watching a reality show. Just not a cool place to hang out for drinks. Beach Bar area: two beach bars that close early (one at 4pm, huh?, the other at 8) so there isn't anywhere else to have a drink near the beach on this property after 8. Bartenders nice, but not all that personable compared to the Royal Hawaiian in Oahu and other places we went. Pool - Excellent area, nice to relax by although we are on the beach so we didn't understand why people hung out by the pool every day. More a place to refresh for us at the end of a beach day. Beach - Great location, some amazing snorkeling (turtles swim right by you). Cost - They will get your for EVERYTHING and it's not cheap. Want a chair, pay for it. Want an umbrella, pay for it. I'm paying a lot of money for your hotel PLUS a stupid resort fee and you charge me? Just make me prove I'm staying there and give me one. Ridiculous. Luckily we were bequeathed two store bought patio chairs by someone leaving so we used for the week and then gave them to someone else. Wonder how long those have been passed around, LOL. Towels were free but you have to have a card to get them. Then they'll ask you if you want to buy sunglasses while you're getting the towel. Yes, I'll buy overpriced sunglasses from you since the ones on my face while I'm talking to you are not noticeable enough. You get the drift, any chance to squeeze an extra dime out of you on their already expensive resort with a ridiculous resort fee they will try and do it. Now, I'm not complaining as much as warning you if you stay here (I did give this hotel four stars). It's just bothersome but won't stop your enjoyment of the beach, sun, cocktails and all the other fun you will have on Maui. It's just the way of the world now. But their front desk staff could use some customer service training, that is for sure. Coming from the Royal Hawaiian, where service was top-notch, this was disappointing.

We arrived around 11:00 p.m. (highly recommend SpeediShuttle if you don't have a car) and had no problems checking in. The hotel is pretty quiet at this time of night and it smells beautiful since there are flowering trees and shrubs everywhere. However, we were not greeted with a lei (as everyone imagines their first visit to Hawaii to be) nor did we have help with our luggage (although we didn't ask either). We did get a lei made of shells the next day but we had to ask about it since they were hanging behind the front desk. The Aloha spirit was missing here (except the front desk clerk that helped us change rooms the next morning - she provided top notch service and I wish I remembered her name). Room: We were very disappointed with our original room because it was not up to the Sheraton standard that we are used to (Room 3503). The carpet looked dirty, the bathrooms were outdated, and the lanai was so small there was only enough room for one little chair and table (no space for a partner). Working in health care I always do a bed bug check before we unpack and thankfully didn't find any signs. Unfortunately, our room did have termite issues. The night stand had huge gaps filled of termite eggs. I'm not sure if they were dead or alive but upon closer inspection we noticed holes all over the night stand and we're not sure why the Sheraton would keep this furniture around? We called the front desk and explained our disappointment. They said they'd find us a new room but had to wait until the morning. We did find two little bottles of sparkling wine in the room for our anniversary which was nice. The hotel kept their promise and moved us the next morning to a much nicer room that has been updated more recently. We had to give up our king size bed for two doubles but it was worth it. The new room (2118) had a garden view on the first floor just steps away from the beach. The location was perfect! The beds are extremely comfortable and the linens were clean. It had a big flat screen TV that allowed an iPod hook up to watch movies. The bathroom vanity was gorgeous with a nice marble countertop. Another nice feature was a separate closet for the toilet so you had privacy while your partner got ready. Food: We only ate at the hotel once because of the price. We had the buffet breakfast our first morning because we didn't know our way around yet. The food was very good but the price for two people plus tax and tip came to approx. $70! That is crazy so we never ate at the resort again. They also have a major bird issue around food so don't be surprised to see birds sitting by your table waiting for you to leave your food. Drinks are $10 which is pretty common around this area. My suggestion would be to find out when all the happy hours are in the area and go to Whalers Village for breakfast (Cane & Taro has amazing eggs benedict and fruit smoothies plus the price is right). Everything is extremely expensive at this hotel but luckily it is easy to walk to Whalers Village where you can find an ABC Store for supplies (we loved these stores because they are everywhere and reasonably priced) and a variety of restaurants. However, the hotel does offer some free activities that you should partake in like learning the hula, watching the cliff dive ceremony at dusk, shuttle to Lahaina, etc. We didn't stick around the hotel much so I can't offer comments about the other free activities. Property: This is one of our favorite things about the Sheraton - its location on the beach. Snorkeling at the black rock with giant sea turtles was a highlight of our trip. It's amazing how friendly they are and will swim right up to you. My husband learned to paddleboard at black rock but the rental was very expensive ($35 per hour). The grounds are beautiful and parking is included in the $25 per night resort fee. We were disappointed that wireless internet was only available in the hotel lobby and it is extremely slow. There is an internet connection in the room but we only travel with iPods/iPads. They have a great pool with lots of chairs and thankfully don't allow chair saving. The torch lights at night really add a nice ambiance. It's a very beautiful resort. Location: While staying in this area, my husband took in some great surfing lessons down the beach for $70 (1.5-2.0 hours of instruction) - and they got him up surfing! Some of our favorite places include Yogurtland (after a hot day on the beach), Leilani's for Happy Hour Mai Tais (shout out to Ian - best bartender ever), and Hula Grill for coconut calamari. The Whaler's Museum is also cool (check out their payday and fine info). WARNING: Check your room charges the day before you leave. When they switched our room they started charging us a much higher rate even though they said the upgrade would be free. We were overcharged approx. $1,250! When I pointed out the error to the front desk she said she would have it corrected. I asked to have it corrected now so I could have a copy of the revised invoice. She seemed bothered by this (even though no one was waiting) but I'm glad I waited. It took her a really long time in the back to get it corrected (20 minutes or so). When she came out, we were still overcharged by $400. Everything finally got corrected after another long wait but we're happy we worked it out before we checked out. Overall: We loved the resort but not the price of food or rentals. We actually would have spent more time at the resort if their prices were more reasonable ($11 for cereal?). Would I go back? Maybe, if the price was right but I'd likely rent a condo in the area instead. Oh yeah, we saw a night stand being hauled out the back the next day so hopefully it was the one from our first room.", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, California", "Title": "\u201cNot worth the price!

The pro's of staying there was the snorkeling at Black Rock and being close to Whalers Village for other restaurant options and shopping. Lahainia is only a 10 min. drive. Also, if you play golf, there are 2 courses there. The view from our balcony was great. The con's were a room upgrade was $50 a night, no in-room Wifi, very small out-dated room, small closet with the room safe, so no room for shoes and on top of the safe was the ice bucket and glasses, paper cups for coffee and plastic cups in the bathroom. The pictures of the rooms on the website didn't look anything like our room. I usually take pictures of our rooms because I'm a scrapbooker but I didn't take any of this room because there wasn't anything special about it. I don't think our floor got vacuumed either, saw the same dead flowers on the floor for 2 days until I picked them up. The breakfast buffett was almost $60 for 2! We went to the Cannery and had a great breakfast at LuLu's for a reasonable price. No discounts of any kind for staying there or being a SPG member. The drinks at the Cliff bar weren't very good at all. I don't want a strong drink but I would like a little taste of the rum in my Lava flow which was like a slushy with no flavor. I thought that maybe it was just us until I talked to severaly other guests at pool who had the same complaints and I didn't bring it up until they said something. It wasn't like the hotel was packed, it wasn't busy at all. We could of been upgraded w/o paying the extra $$. The front desk person at check out was rude. I wanted a copy of our bill and she said it was sent to our email. I said I hadn't read my email yet, (it was 6:45 am) and she repeated rudely that it was sent to our email. The difference with the 2 hotels we stayed at in Wailea, (the Grand Wailea and the Marriott) and the Sheraton, were; we didn't have to pay extra to have an upgraded room, even though I booked a garden view we were upgraded to an ocean view, free of charge! Bigger rooms with Wifi, real cups and glasses. Discounts at the Marriott breakfast buffett, $17 per person. Plus, the Marriott gave us a discount card that could be used at restaurants and shopping on the whole island for our entire stay. We got $40 off our dinner at Humu at the Grand Wailea, excellent dinner. Great service at the adults only pools at both places. We had to have valet parking at the G.W. but it was included in our resort fee, plus they gave us cold bottled water every time we got into our car! I was so disappointed in the Sheraton! I won't stay there again and wouldn't recommend it, either. For what we paid at Sheraton we could have stayed in Wailea and had a much better experience.

The food at the cliff dive bar is is sub-par at best, and I'm being nice, as I suffered from food poisoning the day after eating potato wedges there and ended up losing a day of my honeymoon to an upset stomach as a result. We did not bother eating anything else from any of the restaurants as a result. You're better off buying food from Safeway but check if there's a microwave in your room. We asked for one and ended up PAYING an additional $35 for a microwave. UNBELIEVABLE!! How dare they make us pay extra for something that is standard in every hotel I have ever been to! We didn't bother eating at their nicer restaurant due to the nickel and dimeing. The $25/night room charge is a robbery. There is no wifi and we were forced to use our phone data. I keep hearing in the management responses that this will be fixed by the end of the year, but what good does that do for me now? I live in Northern Virginia and you only honeymoon once. The management should at least reduce the resort fee until this is updated according to my husband who is a hotel manager and has worked in the hotel industry for over ten years. As I mentioned the location is this place's only saving grace, along with Monica at the concierge desk who helped us schedule our honeymoon activities with the money we received though our honeymoon registry with Starwood. She was wonderful. The pool and the grounds are very nice and well kept, and the luau at the Sheraton was great. The nickel and dimeing of everything else ruined the overall stay. Yeah the resort fee supposedly covers self-parking, \"free\" wifi, fitness center, towels, and whatever management claims but what about if you didn't rent a car, or use the fitness center, or in our case, had no wifi for the room? On top of that we did not rent any snorkeling gear from the resort, and went to Boss Frogs instead. We got a killer deal on gear as well as an underwater digital camera for a week. Again the positives are in the Sheraton's location. It's close to the whaler's village which has great restaurants and shops. Try Cane and Taro's. They have excellent sashimi and fish entrees. Also found a sports bar in Lahaina called Lulu's which was great since we're football fans and wanted to watch Monday Night Football. Again all this is close to Ka'anapali where the Sheraton is located. However there are other resorts in this area, so I would suggest giving those a shot. As I mentioned we live in Northern Virginia so it's unlikely we'll return to Maui or any of the islands soon as it is an extremely long trip but if we do return anytime soon it will not be to the Sheraton. If I'm to pay resort fees then it better be for things that actually are there.

However breakfast at the restaurants in Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village (15 minute stroll) was also excellent (& much less expensive) - Service in the restaurant for dinner was slow even though there was hardly anyone there - The onsite bars all close early, so be prepared to have any late nights elsewhere (by taxi) - Pool area gets busy; shade can be hard to come by. The cabanas are available for hire at $60 per day - The relatively high resort fee is charged to every room every day & incorporates towel hire, the shuttle and parking etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.The Sheraton should look at reducing the fee for guests who don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a car & aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t using the parking We cannot wait to come back to this fantastic hotel in its sensational location.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorktown, NY", "Title": "\u201cSheraton, Maui, HI\u201d", "Author": "Yorktown_NYJane", "ReviewID": "UR118753450", "Content": "This hotel is absolutely beautiful and offers everything to make your stay wonderful!

When we were done at the front desk we turned around to find Andrew with our luggage on a cart ready for us.

The entire hotel from our room, and including the grounds, the pool, the restaurants, and the spa were perfectly maintained and beautiful. We always would receive a warm and friendly Aloha from all the hotel staff, including the grounds keepers.

We had an amazing time at this resort and loved the location! This hotel is situated on the best part of Kaanapali Beach and right next to Black Rock. The beach area was large and the snorkeling here was amazing. We swam with sea turtles 2 out of the five days we were there. The hotel was within a five minute walk to Whaler's village. The resort is beautiful with tasteful furnishings and an open air layout. The service was excellent, as the concierge in the lobby helped us book a tour that went to Haleakala to see the sunrise. She also provided us advice regarding on the road to Hana and a handy tip sheet. The also hotel sent up champagne to help us celebrate our honeymoon. This hotel is the priciest hotel we stayed at during our honeymoon but it was worth it! There was a $25/night resort fee, which included parking and internet access. We rented beach-side cabanas for $46 a day. We only got the cabanas for two of our days there. The Mai Tai bar was very pricey but I had one of the best burgers I've eaten there. We didn't eat at the breakfast buffet or ate at any of the restaurants at the hotel as they were too expensive. We walked to Whaler's Village or drove to Lahaina instead to eat . The hotel itself did not seem very busy at all and seemed like there was enough room for everyone to get a quiet spot to themselves. We did not use the pool or stay around the pool area, although it was a very beautiful pool. I would have given this resort a 5 out of 5, however, at check in, we were disappointed to find out that there were no rooms left with a king sized bed, so instead we were given a room with two doubles, even though we booked months in advance and we had mentioned at time of booking that we were honeymooners. We were moved to a room with a king sized bed two nights after we checked in, but would have preferred not having to go through the trouble of repacking and relocating. It was a bit of an inconvenience. On the bright side we did get a bit of a better view being on the ocean side but it was a room on the first floor of the hotel minimized our view of the ocean.

When we got to the hotel and checked in, the first thing we noticed was that the check in staff was not that friendly. It was also at that time when we found out that we were getting two double beds, as opposed to a single queen/king bed. During the booking process, it was stated that we would get a single bed, however the staff had indicated that there we were no more left and that when they do get a room with it, they would contact us. So we thought, ok, let's just play it by ear and see what happens. Well, when we got to our room, guess what, we were placed right next to the elevator, and I mean literally right next to it. We could constantly hear the elevator go up and down, and it was impossible for anyone to stay in that room and still be sane. We complained to the staff about this and they put us into another room, but the fact that the put us in that room is beyond inconsiderate. Folks, this is a room that you will have to see to believe. After our second day we asked the staff if there were any rooms opened with a single bed and they told us no. At this point we were just going to make the best out of this trip and just ignore the room situation. The thing is, I'm a Starwood Preferred Guest member and have stayed in Sheratons/Westins all over the world, and have always been satisfied with the staff, rooms, etc. However, this incident with the room was a total miss. On the other side, the hits of the trip is that it is close to snorkeling; no need to swim over corals or jump off a catamaran. Basically if you were to walk over the shore, dip your head into the water, you'll see fish. We say this huge sea turtle that was feeding near the rocks. Quite an experience. The beach is also pretty nice. So...overall I would give it an average rating due to the room situation. I was really disappointed in that. They could have done better.

As for the resort, it was fairly large with a nice relaxing pool area and very easy beach access just a few steps from most rooms. All you really want in a honeymoon is some peace and relaxation along with a nice, clean room to rest. This resort definitely delivers in all areas! We booked through Jennifer Lodge at Unforgettable Honeymoons. She matched the package price that we found with Orbitz (with discount code) and beat it by $20 per person. In addition, she arranged a wonderful gift (bottle of champagne and picture frame) for us upon arrival along with an upgrade to a deluxe oceanview room even though we booked for the cheapest Gardenview room originally. We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the resort. The food service poolside was amazing. We loved the refreshing drinks with the spicy munchies they provide complimentary at the bar with every drink! The Mahi Mahi fish tacos are to die for!!! One negative note: Throughout our trip we noticed a few ants here and there crawling near the bath tub and sink area in our washroom, but we didn't really think much of it since we were on the ground floor and it was a tropical destination. However, on our last night, we noticed a fairly large number of ants in our closet. Some of them were crawling onto the hangers and our clothes. We called the front desk about this. They sent someone right up to spray the area. They also offered to put our clothes in the laundry and have them ready in time for our departure the next morning early. In addition, they offered a $100 credit to use for dinner at their restaurant that night.

We booked the hotel using Starwood Points and heard great things about it on Trip Advisor. When we arrived the staff was very friendly and we were upgraded to an Ocean Front room. The view was spectacular as was the beach in front of the hotel. The problem with the hotel was the room which just seemed old and outdated. Everything just seemed dingy and didn't match the amazing view we had. The house keeping was terrible. They seemed to only make the bed and pick up the towels. They don't vaccum because there was dust bunnies and leaves in the corners of the room that were there all 6 days. They also didn't pick up empty water glasses, condiments or silver wear from the one night we had room service. They just left it there the entire time. One night we got back to our room and they left a note saying the room was locked so that they couldn't get in to clean. This wasn't true because we were out all day and you can only lock the room from the inside. When we called house keeping for towels they apologized for not cleaning the room and said it was because we had our do not disturb sign out (this was also a lie). The person who brought us towels apologized for not cleaning our room and said it was because they were too busy that day. We literally got three different stories in 30 minutes. We had the breakfast buffet and were not crazy about it but a la carte costs the same as the buffet. They have a Starbucks cart where they also sell breakfast sandwhichs and pastries so that was perfect for breakfast everyday. The hotel grounds and lobbys were really nice as was the beach. There is great snorkeling right off of Black Rock but it is very crowded. They rent out snorkeling equipment at the hotel which was convenient. The pool seemed small and there weren't many umbrellas so we just spent our time at the beach. We paid $45 for the cabanas because there are not beach chairs provided on the beach by the hotel. The $25 resort fee covers towels, internet access and parking etc. but the rooms don't get internet access. You have to go to a public lobby to get wifi. Also, they give you two cards to trade in to get two beach towels. To get the cards back you have to give the towels back. This and the wifi were irritating. I asked for 4 cards when we checked in so that we could get 4 towels at a time. Overall this is an average hotel because the room is not very nice but the location and the beach are amazing.

This was my our fourth trip to the Hawaii Islands and we've stayed at some lovely hotels and this was our LEAST favorite place by far. That being said, the property at the Sheraton was beautiful making our experience that much more frustrating. CONS: It's biggest drawback would be that it sits in a cluster of hotels and also on pubic beach property which makes it incredibly crowded. Our first day there, we went out to lay by the pool around lunch time and there was ABSOLUTELY no where to lay out. As a result, we were forced to grab a seat at 7/8am every morning if we intended to sit by the pool. I'm not sure if this was a result of busy season or if there were just beach trespassers (i.e. non-hotel guests) sneaking onto the property. Regardless, I've never had this issue at any of the other big hotel chains (i.e. Hilton in Kauai, Turtle Bay Resort in Oahu, Sheraton on Big Island, Hilton on Big Island), on the other Hawaiian Islands. In addition, the hotel staff was not as personable as the other hotels either. I think this was mainly due to the fact that there were so many guests (and maybe not enough staff) that they didn't have the ability to be overly accommodating to every guest, as we had seen at the other hotels we stayed at in Hawaii. In addition, our hotel lanai was a joke! Again, I'm not sure if we just had bad luck or if all the Lanai's were this small, but our Lanai was only big enough to house one chair and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with no one sitting on it. My husband and I NEVER went outside on our Lanai the entire trip (4 days) because there was no room for us. This was probably the biggest disappointment about this property because we absolutely LOVE having our morning coffee (and afternoon book readings) on the Lanai. So that pretty much sums up our trip. PROS: As I mentioned previously, the Sheraton is a beautiful property. If you came to shop, there is a lovely shopping area within walking distance from the hotel. There is also a nice area right off the hotel where you can go snorkeling. All this being said, my husband and I both prefer seclusion and relaxation on our trips to Hawaii...so perhaps the hustling and bustling of the Sheraton may be right for some individuals, but it was definitely not our cup of tea.

The staff were accommodating, everything felt new, it was clean, you couldn't ask for a better spot to spend as a jumping off point for exploring Maui!

Sheraton hotels has always given me positive experiences in their other locations, and i trust in the quality. One of the reasons why i booked this location is becuase it's situated on kannapali, rated one of the best beaches in the world, and the beautiful scenary. The hotel is also build on black rock, which is very attractive to fish, and sea turtles. When we reached our hotel, we were prompted quickly by the staff and a welcoming \"aloha\" with a seashell necklace. We walked through an open hallway to the concierge and realized the whole hotel was \"open\". The sun, breeze, and hawaiian music just surrounded the space. It was breathtaking and had a huge \"wow factor\". This is coming from a jaded new yorker who doesn't get easily impressed! We had booked a 5 night 6 day stay, in the deluxe partial ocean view, and the concierge upgraded our room to one that was on the top of the entire hotel.. A deluxe ocean view? We had our own private parking lot access and when we got to our room, i literally screamed with happiness. It was what i dreamed of, an open bedroom with a balcony views of the mountain, the resort, and ocean sunset. Soft breezes, flowers on my balcony, and birds chirping were so suureal. The maid for our room was impeccable, she replaced all towels, sheets, organized our room everyday. We even got free boxes of mac nut chocolates and tote bags, almost everyday. Haha. There are some small negatives about the hotel, however.... The original hotel was built in the 70's and since then they had renovations and expansions. There are different parts of the hotel and directions were confusing to find. It took us about 10-15 min to figure out how we can get to our room, the room number didn't coorelate with the floor number, and there are bridges to other sections of other buidings. To make up for this, they have impeccable decor and scenic points with benches in the hotel to overlook on the beautiful beach. The hotel bar, pool, performances were also top notch. It impressed me to see gardeners working everyday to keep flowers and foliage on top condition. There were flowers on every tree, every pine was well groomed..very impressive. The only other small negative is that, even though there are 3 places that serve food on the grounds, they somehow rotate in their operation time. There was a time where all the restaurants were closed between breakfast and lunch. That's kind of weird to me, considering its mid morning... I had an awesome stay at this hotel and would recommend this to anyone taking a trip to maui. I was so sad to leave!! I was so happy with this hotel that i've signed up for the starwood american express to become a preferred guest. Thanks for the dreamy, impeccable vacation sheraton! Mahalo!

I would rate the Sheraton Maui as the best of these hotels. I was attending a conference at Grand Hyatt but decided to stay at Sheraton instead. While each hotel had their plus/minus, Hyatt was dirtier than most (especially the pool which smelled of urine) and the beach was not very good. Located just west of Lahaina, Kaanapali is a long sandy beach fronted by at least a dozen very large resort hotels. On one end is Hyatt. On the other is Sheraton. Sheraton actually strides black rock; a large, black lava extrusion jutting out from the beach. Black rock apparently factors into Hawaii legend. So it is a mystery to me how Sheraton ever obtained permission to build on it. But build they did. The hotel sprawls along the beach and up to and over the massive black rock. Despite the extremely large and busy resort, the staff treated us as if we were their only guests. The hotel is amazingly spotless. The gardens are well maintained. The pool is formed like a river with small water falls. One end is a sort of adult pool and the other a childrens pool. There is one tiny hot tub on the property. We stayed one night in a regular garden view room (bldg 3). Room was nice. Usual rectangular box shape. Well maintained and clean. We were upgraded the next 12 nights to an ocean view in bldg 6. Room was roughly same size as our first room. However, bathroom was very large with marble top, chrome fixtures. The ocean view was looking west along the other side of black rock. What sets apart Sheraton from the other hotels on this stretch of beach comes down to the snorkeling. For some reason the other portions of the beach are a bit murky and smell of algae. Black rock has surprisingly good underwater visibility (perhaps 75 feet) and great fish, coral. This is surprising because there are not only lots of swimmers but lots of kids jumping off black rock. But black rock has something else; lots of turtles. Very large turtles. These turtles (some about 4 feet long) swim within feet of shore and seem to have long gotten over their fear of humans. In fact turtles seem to demand the right of way otherwise they will swim right into you. I cannot overemphasize enough about the undersea life visible right off shore. There is a board walk starting at Sheraton and ending at Hyatt. Because of the configuration of the walkway Sheraton had much less pedestrian, pass through traffic than the other hotels. We ate once in the restaurant. A buffet breakfast. Very expensive and the food was so so. Mostly we ate pick up a few things from the coffee cart (long line because only one person works the cart). They do have the annoying \"resort fee\". What you get for that (not that you have a choice) is: Maui newspaper, car parking, and wired internet in the room (which worked very well). I believe that there may have been some free use of the room phone but who uses wired phones nowadays? There are areas around the hotel with wireless internet. Cons: Pool was not heated. Also, while there were enough chaise lounges for anyone that needed one, there were limited number that had umbrellas. Not good, as one can get roasted rather quickly in the tropics. Pro: Nice pool otherwise. Best beach for snorkeling, swimming, diving. Great staff. Very clean. Tip: Black rock divides Kaanapali beach in half. The east side is where about 90% of visitors swim. However, as I learned staying at the Royal Lahaina, the west side of Kaanapali is an incredible unspoiled beach that stretches for miles. Fish are not as plentiful as around the rock but is can be a relaxing place to spend some time. The hotel does not have a free shuttle to/from airport. Best to pick up a rental at the airport.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWill be back.. someday\u201d", "Author": "sahnchoi", "ReviewID": "UR117711886", "Content": "We actually stayed here in June 2010, so this is a late review, however, I remember how great this resort was very well.

We used Starpoints and stayed for free for a week, and the location at Black Rock is second to none. In terms of location, on Maui, Ka'anapali is the place to stay, and the Sheraton has the best location on Ka'anapali. Now, here's the lowdown. Like all Starwood properties, the location is absolutely top-notch. On the other hand, the hotel nickle and dimes you at every opportunity. The staff, while friendly, did leave something to be desired on occasion. We had booked an ocean view room in advance, but when we arrived at the hotel, we were interested in upgrading. However, we wanted to see the second room before we decided to spend the money. The guy at the front desk said we couldn't see the room, so we decided to stay with what we had booked. We loved it, but we found the customer service less than optimal, to put it mildly. Later in our trip, at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai, we went through the same thing and the service at the Hyatt could not have been better. Another example of the nickel and diming was when we brought leftovers back to the room. I called down to room service to ask if we could get plates and silverware. I was told that not only was there a 45 minute wait, but there was a $1 charge just to deliver plates and silverware! Particularly obnoxious at the Sheraton, as at all Starwoods, is the fact that they charge you an arm and a leg for beach chairs. We passed on the charge, instead renting beach chairs in Lahaina. The chairs cost us less for a week than what two chairs would have cost us for a day. Here's an example of what the Sheraton is really all about. We received a phone call telling us that as Starwood Preferred Guests,to please come down to receive our free gift. Our free gift was a box of chocolates you could buy for $2.99 at Walmart or Long's Drugs. Thank Sheraton! To top it off, we then had to listen to a sales pitch for the Westin condos up the beach that they can't sell because of the lousy economy. What a waste of time. The woman was trying to get people to sign up for a tour of the condos, which we declined. What a waste of time! To summarize, my wife and I are Starwood Preferred Guests, on our second trip to the Sheraton Maui, and we had told the hotel numerous times that we were traveling for our 10th wedding anniversary. In honor of all this, the hotel gave us a $2.99 box of chocolates. Before this trip, my wife and I were exclusive Starwood travelers, as we even have the SPG credit card. However, the customer service here was so lousy and the service at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai was so great, that our eyes have been opened to other hotels. At the Hyatt, we received 15% off at the spa, a complimentary bottle of champagne, complimentary dessert at a hotel restaurant, and a free cabana for a day. Probably the most annoying thing at the hotel has to do with beach towels, a policy I can only describe as so stupid, whoever came up with it must have done so as a joke, thinking no one would agree to it. You have to give a card to get a towel, and you only get one towel. The towel guys leave at 5, so if you want a fresh towel, too bad. You just need to hold onto your dirty towel until tomorrow, because you can't get your new towel unless you turn in the old one. Who knew towels were so expensive they had to be guarded so carefully? Also, be prepared to have the towel guys try to sell you Maui Jim sunglasses every time you try to get your towel. It's not that I wouldn't recommend the Sheraton Maui. The location is fantastic, the grounds are beautiful, and the convenience to Lahaina is great. However, the service and nickel and diming was very disappointing, especially since we had such great memories from our honeymoon.

All of the staff from the valets to the front desk to the wait staff and housekeepers bent over backwards to please. The common areas were all open, airy, clean and well-manicured. Our 10 and 11 year old kids loved the pool. The huge beach area was clean and not overly-packed. The beach area just steps north of the facility, on the golf course, was especially uncrowded. One of the major reasons we wanted to stay at the Black Rock area on our 3rd trip to Maui was to have easy access to the ocean and turtles/fish who reside there. Within 30 minutes of check-in, we were snorkeling with our underwater friends and had a great time. Don't forget to also snorkel at the beach area just north of the hotel. Literally steps away from the tennis courts. And having a premium scuba company, 5 Star Scuba Diving, operating right on the premises was a super-bonus. I highly recommend them and scuba instructor Ty Burnett who is a jewel. He certified my 11 year old and introduced my 10 year old to diving in - he was a huge reason why we had so much fun at the Sheraton. He has years of experience, plenty of patience and I hgihly recommend him and 5 Star - as a dive instructor myself, and having certified hundreds of divers, I can attest to his abilities. We also loved the easy access to other Ka'anapali resorts just down the walk, where we surfed and parasailed.

Right at the end of Ka'anapali beach. I was a bit concerned that the score seemed average. Out of the 30 or so hotels in the area it scored in the middle somewhere. I decided to delve deeper and read all the reviews before deciding. It seemed there was no particular reasons why it didn't score very highly. I decided to go with my gut and chose the hotel for my honeymoon. I emailed the hotel a couple of times prior to our trip and asked if it be possible for a specific room that I thought would be ideal for our needs. It overlooked the beach and the grounds and had beautiful views of the sunset and cliff dive ceremony each evening. The hotel of course cannot guarantee room but did assure me they would make a note of this request and do their very best. We travelled from Ireland and were exhausted when we arrived. We had been up for 27hours straight. Dublin, London, LA, Maui.... but... it was worth it. Even though the airlines lost our cases for 2 days haha. Still worth it. We checked in quite late, maybe 9 or 10pm and the staff were very nice. They offered a tour of the grounds to help orient us, but we were too tired so had to decline. The check in process was swift as I think the check in lady must have seen how tired we were. Everything was ready and we were on our way to the room within 2 minutes! The lady also informed us that the resort fee had been taken care of and also supplied us with complimentary breakfast vouchers. This turned out to be a really really nice extra as the breakfast setup was amazing. It set us up for the day each morning. Chef on hand to make imlettes with a smile, excellent choice of hot foods, excellent choice of fresh fruits and baked items. Very attentive staff on hand with OJ and coffee and a smile. It really became a centrepoint to our day. A great start each day with smiles and good food. 10/10 for the breakfast setup. If your not sure about paying for the breakfast each day I would 100% recommend it. I know buffets can be hit and miss, but this one is a hit! anyway... back to my story. We arrived at our room, and it was the exact room I had requested, on the top floor of the building I had requested, overlooking the sea. There was a very nice note congratulating us on our honeymoon etc. This would be a good point to say that the condition of the rooms is excellent. I had read the hotel was last updated in the early 2000s? but it looks top quality. Nice furnishings, nice HD TV with plenty of channels, excellent air con, a good size cooler/fridge/icemaker, and plenty of storage space. Oh, and a BIG safe, not the 6inch high half size ones, but a full size one which was also nice. Iron and hangers and all the usual you would expect. Our room had two balconys(Lanai?) but we only used the one that face the sea mostly as the other one was overlooked by some other rooms. This was fine, the other one was just a bonus really. The bed is really comfortable and I slept 9 hours each night, uninterrupted. Beautiful. So peaceful. Opening the balcony door in early morning at sunrise and all you would hear is the gentle lapping of the waves. We went for a morning swim at Dawn most mornings because our sleep cycle ended up being 9 or 10pm till 6am. This was fine though, it was great to get early starts and get down for breakfast for 7am. I would recommend a morning swim if you are awake. We saw a green sea turtle swim right under our feet while snorkling in the morning. My wife saw a Ray one morning too. So, a couple of things to help with your trip. Whalers village is only 5minute walk at most. Maybe 200 or 300 yards from hotel. I had heard people say it was a drive only etc. Are you crazy? :) It's right there. 5minute walk. Yo can drive though if you want to buy alot of stuff and don't want to carry it back. plenty of parking off the Ka'anapali parkway. It has 40 or 50 shops. Tshirts, Jewelry, ABC stores for beer/suncream/groceries etc and McDonalds, and some restaurants, and everything else you would need. It's very nice. Second point, I would recommend a car. I assume most would have one anyway as Americans seem to go everywhere by car, and I think its was 95% americans at the resort and in the area in general. I only saw 2 other Europeans. I guess its a long way to come.:) The reason I would recommend a car? Well there are some lovely beaches that I thought were even better than Ka'anapali beach and they are only 10minutes drive north up the coast. Napili bay being one. Plenty of street parking once you get up there by 1030 or 11am. If you try and arrive inthe afternoon you will have ZERO chance of finding parking, s make it a day trip and go in the morning, and have lunch there at the Napili beach hotel restaurant, which is very reasonably priced and has wonderful menu and views of the bay. There are also some other more private beaches along the same road. Explore. :) We also drove to visit the Haleakea crater one day. We didn't bother with the sunset/sunrise though as it was too much to get up at 3am to start driving etc, or to drive home at 8pm in the dark. So we did a day trip. Leaving hotel at 730 and arriving at the summit about 3 hours later. The views were spectacular, 10,000ft. Up above the clouds. I know people say it is cold etc, so we took hoodies but didn't use them. Sure it was obviously colder than sea level but not as cold as I had expected. We were fine in our shorts and T-shirts. Mind you, we are from Ireland so what we think is cold is probably freezing for someone from California etc. :) We also visited Maui Ocean Centre on the way back in the afternoon as its on the same route. Well worth the steep admission fee. You should put aside at least 2 hours for the visit. so much to see. We booked a Catamaran trip from the pool attendents office. They were very helpful and rang the catamaran people and set it all up. It seemed price at 120usd each, but... it was worth it. It wa son the Terelani 2 and the staff on the boat were excellent. The price included an all yo can eat lunch f salad and burgers and hotdogs freshly BBQ'd on the boat, plus an open bar with cocktails and beers (once you were done snorkling for the day). I had a great time, and considering the trip, all the equipment included, the lunch and the 3 or 4 beers I had, all of a sudden 120 seemed like great value. We also then did the highway to hana drive another morning. Left at 7am, and got home at about 9pm at night. It's a long day, but so worth it. We bought an audio CD in boss frogs rental shop that tells you all about the drive as you do it. Each track is linked to am ile marker so you can hear relevant info as you drive, very nice for 8 or 9 bucks. well worth it. We bought sandwiches in Piea, the last town before the highway starts proper. Good move, I would have bought more sandwiches as its along drive. We stopped along th way for photos of course. At the end of the highway to Hana at the seven pools, we parked and did the walk to the waterfall. It was almost 2 miles of uphill walking, but.... the reward was magical. Through the bamboo forrest I had heard so much about and then out to see the highest waterfall I have ever seen in my life. It's beautiful. Like something out of avatar or lost. :) anyway, get a car as Maui has alot more to offer than just 2 weeks by a pool. Even if the hotel is wonderful. Always enough space, always enough sun loungers, and the staff were always genuinely friendly and warm. Aloha spirit is alive and well at this hotel. Every member of staff I interacted with, from gardeners, to room attendents, to bellhops, to barmen, to breakfast staff, were the embodiment of the Aloha spirit. They are a credit to the hotel and make it a warm place to be not just a glitzy luxury hotel with no spirit. So thats pretty much it really.

Advice: Be patient, hug the side of the road & pray! If you're up for more adventure, keep going to the art gallery at the Point - nice stuff, make sure you look into the gorgeous valley in back.

ROOMS We all stayed up on Black Rock, which was quite a trek to and from the beach/pool area but totally worth it! All of our rooms had incredible furnished balconies, with views almost entirely of the ocean. Nearly everyday we would see two sea turtles right off our balcony, and humpback whales swimming in the bay. Even a couple of rainbows. Just gorgeous. The beds were comfortable, bathrooms spacious (water closet with door so both shower and toilet could be privately used at same time). The room had a small kitchenette; microwave, small refrigerator, and cupboard space. The TV hookups are not blocked, so we brought an XBOX to watch movies on at night in the room so we didn't have to pay for them through the hotel (15$). Free wi-fi (well technically I believe it's rolled into the resort fee), and free parking. Carpets could use replacing and the electrical outlets were fickle, but besides that, nothing to complain about. POOL There was definitely a shortage of beach chairs around the pool while we were there. Towel game in full force! We would set our towels down on our way to breakfast in the mornings and by 8AM there was already not much choice. Cabanas can be rented for 40$ a day, the in-laws did this often, which was nice as the wait staff would come by with water pitchers and cups all day long. Pool was clean, large and fantastic. There's a kid section, waterfall, floating bean bags up for grabs, a lazy river with a small water slid, and a deeper area that was used mainly by adults. Also a hot tub, but children were rampant here! About 6 or 7 kids splashing in there everytime we went, so I wouldn't recommend it. BEACH The beach was fantastic but could get extremely crowded. If you're looking for seclusion on your holiday, this is not where you will find it. Snorkeling was incredibly popular along Black Rock, but with good reason as it's very beautiful. Hawaii experienced a few heavy rains while we were there which caused the water to be very silty and difficult to see in so skip on snorkeling after a rainy day. The water was warm and pleasant with a nice sandy beach, but waves could be rough at times so be mindful of little ones. Lots of paddle surfing going on. Beach volleyball was the biggest letdown for us as we love to play during our vacations. The net was set up only one day of our 24 day stay! FOOD The resort has one option for breakfast, and a couple for lunch and dinner. We had originally planned to prepare a lot of meals in our room since we were there for so long and food in Maui is pricey, but it was hard to resist! We hit up Safeway on our way to the hotel from the airport. Breakfast is okay-we had vouchers for free breakfast (tip not included) but without that I don't think we would have went, we probably would have opted to just eat fruit and bagels in the room. Teppanyaki Dan's was satisfactory, ate here twice, can't beat the Japanese food we get in Seattle though. Be sure to make reservations. Most days we would end up ordering drinks and snacks by the pool, which were not worth the price. Chicken kabobs were undercooked on two occasions. Drinks were in small plastic cups. I would recommend walking down to Whaler's Village for more options as they have a nice food court there. SERVICE Excellent! Loved talking to Kimmy everyday by the pool to get recommendations for dinner and other activities. Everyone is very friendly here. We were waited on by Walter at breakfast everyday and he was great too! I guess it's a testament to how great they are that I remember their names after 7 months :) Front desk was nice, didn't deal with them much but check-in was easy. TIPS -Rent a car! This was priceless as it afforded us the option to eat at many other restaurants on Maui. It also enabled us to see other sites like Dragon's Teeth and Iao Valley. -Eat at Pineapple Grill! We ate here twice-for my in-laws anniversary dinner and my husband's birthday. Both times were fantastic! Great views, service and food. -Use the free shuttle to Whalers or LaHaina. -Dinner and magic show at Warren and Annabelle's was great! -Rent snorkeling gear in one of the nearby shopping areas for about 15$ a week. -At least once while you're here check out the cliff diving ceremony at sunset. -Humpback whale season is December through May, if here during this time I highly recommend a whale watching cruise! We saw about 7 humpbacks and two dolphins plus a beautiful sunset. Plus, keep your camera ready at the beach at the Sheraton.

Building 2 runs perpendicular with the beach so your view is over the main courtyard and beachfront with a view of blackrock.

Also the staff at the enterprise car rental which was right on the property, was great. We just rented a car one day for the trip to Hana. We used the shuttle one day to go downtown. A little walk to downtown from Hilo Hatties but not bad. Great burger at Cool Cats. We also tried Cheeseburger in Paradise on another trip. It was packed but they had 2 seats at the bar and we walked right in. Bartender was great and we ate dinner right there. Snorkel early at Black Rock prior to 10am and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll pretty much have it to your self. After that got a little crowded but still ok. After lunch I would walk around building 4 to the golf cart path which takes you to the other side of blackrock. Maybe 1 or 2 people there but basically you have a long stretch of beach all to yourself. Great snorkeling but water a little rougher on that side. Its also the side I saw the large sea turtles that live around the rock. I am ready to return! As for the flight, first plane out of Love Field was 2 hours late causing us to miss our connection in Denver. We were suppose to fly from Denver into Maui but now had to connect to LA then Maui. Of course the Denver flight was late which made us late into LAX. We arrived and went 2 gates over to board our flight. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize United had booked us on a Delta flight 2 terminals over! We had to run the whole way and luckly a young lady on a golf cart took us part of the way. Otherwise we never would have made it. Instead of getting in Maui at 3:20 that afternoon we made it around 9PM. That day was shot. And you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll never guess but on the way back in Houston we boarded our flight only to be told due to maintenance we would have to change planes which cost us another hour. I requested a partial refund and United offered me $150 off my next flight.

You can rent a mini pseudo cabana for $40 (all day) or park yourself by the pool. Real easy to find seats and staff was friendly. Wristbands to use the pool are the norm, so don't be surprised by the pool patrol. Didn't bother to have the buffet this go round since we weren't impressed the last time and felt it was pricey. Instead, you can walk beachside to Whalers Village very easily and order from the food express court. They have a McDonald's express, Chinese food, Mexican food and pasta/pizza. Food was very reasonable and I would recommend the caesar's salad with shrimp--it was only $9 and tasty. There's also a variety of restaurants along the way that have early bird specials or specials on certain days of the week. We paid a $35 one-time fee to Sheraton to rent a microwave and it came in very handy. We'd have leftovers for breakfast so that we can start our day with a quick jumpstart. Purchase water and yogurts/fruits at the Lahaina Cannery Mall safeway to save time and money. Resort fees + taxes are within the range of what other hotels are charging ($20-$35 per day). Only downer is that the area can get very windy starting in the early afternoon, so I'd suggest to visit the beach in the earlier hours if your schedule permits. I didn't take advantage of the kids club, but I think they offer a program that partners with the Westin Hotel. Fitness Center is small (3-4 treadmills, 1 bike, free weights), but you can jog along the beach paved path if jogging along the beach isn't your thing. The paved path gets pretty busy, though.

I recommend a car as it comes in handy for the day trips around the island. The location on Black Rock is some of the best snorkeling you will find. We swam with multiple turtles, spotted rays and eagle rays. An amazing experience. It is also an easy drive to anywhere on the island. I searched very hard to find the perfect place to stay on Maui.

There are a number of conceirge's on hand to accomodate the number of guests that are coming through. I was a little underwhelmed with our room. While we didn't spend too much time in there anyway, for the amount of money you're spending I expected something nicer. Toiletries were OK and the bathroom could use an upgrade. Overall, it is still a nice hotel but again, I guess I just expected more. The grounds, however, were beautiful. Flowers and perfectly manicured grass all around. The pool appeared to be well maintained as well (only issue is there never seemed to be enough lounge chairs at the peak of the afternoon!). The beach is public so it also became crowded at times but it's a great spot for snorkeling. I would definitely recommend the Sheraton Maui to someone thinking of staying in West Maui. Just do your homework and think about what you really want to spend your money on.

Also- the pictures online show more furniture in the rooms than what's really in them! Small tub shower- we stayed in the room right below a suite and it was a crappy tub shower?? PLUS- NO WIFI in the rooms AT ALL- NOT EVEN A PAID OPTION!??!! I've stayed at hotels 1/10th of the price that have wifi! There are hotspots around the resort but those barely work as well. Another major con- the prices. For an 80 minute couples massage they charged us $400!?!? Plus the breakfast buffet (while pretty good) was about $75 for just 2 people. All in all it is a nice place but when we return to Maui we will try and find a place that offers more for your money. I think there are better places here in Maui that offer that.

(I leave my luggage in the car at hotel check-in so I am not dragging it around). We were cheerfully re-assigned (at no additional cost) to a room on the ground floor facing the pools and ocean. It was very nice, and clean as well. The beds were really comfortable too. From our lanai, we could watch kids jumping off of Black Rock into the ocean. There was also a small waterfall and tiki torches about 10 feet away, adding to the ambiance. Our next step was a trip to Safeway for snacks, \"liquid refreshments\", sunblock, etc.. When we got back to the Sheraton, we drove around to the end of the property and located the small parking lot there, which was more convenient to our room than the parking garage or even valet. During our stay, we remarked repeatedly about what a pleasant and elegant hotel this is to visit. The pools are warm and comfortable for lounging, and the ocean around Black Rock is so good for snorkeling and turtle viewing, that it seemed like too much effort to go visit other beaches. On July 4th, the hotel set up booths, activities, and a jump house for kids on the expansive lawns between the hotel and pools. The efforts they made on behalf of their guests makes me understand why this hotel draws such a huge number of repeat guests. I know I will be back! We never had any unhappy encounters with employees or other guests. Everything was just about perfect! Note; be sure to take the elevator up to the 8th floor in the front building on Black Rock. There is a balcony and \"wi-fi living room\" there for all to enjoy. You can see the rest of Kaanapali Beach in both directions!

I have read a great deal of reviews on here prior and during my trip and found them extremely helpful and I hope this helps another person. My experience with The Sheraton in Maui was such a positive one. The location and the staff were an enhancement that added to the beauty of the island. Check-in was easy and fast. Noah Berkley was kind and curteous and made the start of the trip great. I upgraded from a resort view to an ocean view, for a cost, and I am so happy I did. The room was very spacious with a million dollar view. The furniture and decor were a bit old, but I understand they will be updating in a few months. At the end of the day it made no difference to myself and my partner, we spent most of the time we were in the room either asleep or looking at the ocean. The location of the Sheraton is ideal for those looking for great snorkeling. We got up at 6am everyday and went snorkeling at Black Rock. Between 6am-10am there are very few people there and at times we were the only ones snorkeling in the cove. There were tons of fish and the visabiltiy was superb. When taking a break from the ocean, their pool was equally as relaxing. If you get there before it gets busy it is wonderful to read a book or listen to music. You get a view of the ocean and all the aquatic activities that go with it. Joy, The Sheraton's concierge, was very helpful, super sweet and helped me with dinner and lunch recommandations. Thank you Joy! I also want to commend the cleaning staff! Everyday our room was meticulously clean and spotless. They did a wonderful job! I am not one for massages, but I did go down to the Black Rock spa and received the most relaxing massages from Kioto. She was very friendly and nice and had me melting! While they have high speed internet, wireless would be better. This isn't the nineties anymore. My only complaint about the whole place was an employee named Caleb who was down with the towels. I was returning my towel and waiting for my card for about five minutes when he turned around and said to me very rudely, \"What do you want?\" I brushed it off, but the next few times I had to deal with him through the week he was equally as rude. One rude employee could not bring down this perfect vacation though. My partner and I had the time of our lives and will definitely return in the future.

First, let me comment on the Kaanapali area and beach. It is a spectacular area and, in my opinion, the best place to stay, on the west/north side. As many other reviewers have stated, you just can't beat black rock and the snorkeling. We saw several large sea turtles each day.... Even saw some, in the ocean, from our room. The beach and water is beautiful. My family and I took several walks up and down the beaches of Kaanapali. We paid particular attention to some of the other resorts that we were considering. Nothing compared to Sheraton, in opinion. Most didn't even have a beach. Also, we couldn't find a pool or grounds that that were as meticulous or expansive as Sheraton. Others just seemed packed in tight with lounge chairs right on top of each other. Every square foot of property seemed developed. Conversely, Sheraton is wide open with manicured lawns, palm trees, etc... There were only a few minor issues but nothing even close enough to cause us to rate our stay less than five stars. Probably our biggest issue was with an older gentleman working the towel cabana (John I believe). Unlike the rest of the staff, he was pretty rude and not very friendly. The first night we arrived, we checked out a couple towels and strolled the beach. My son and daughter strolled around the pool and decided to take a swim. When my son returned, to retrieve his towel and flip flops, they were gone. For a ten year old, he was pretty upset that his new flip flops were gone. When my wife explained this to John, he was very rude and seemed to imply that she wasn't being honest. Through out the week, I visited the towel cabana several times (without my wife, as we took turns) and he was just not a pleasant person to deal with. Again, everyone else was wonderful. Also, we would've loved it if they piped in some Hawaiian music, in the pool area, as other resorts did. It just puts you in a different mood. And people would probably stay longer and spend more money! As others have said, everything at the resort is expensive. However, there are great options at Whalers Village and Lahaina. Many people recommend Walmart by the airport, which we did. However, there is a great supermarket called the Times Supermarket on Lower Honoapiilani. Great selection and reasonable prices. By the way, pick up some beach chairs and save from having to rent them daily. Be sure to do The Old Lahaina Luau.... well worth it! We thought Maui would be a once in a life time trip. However, we had such a great time, we are already considering coming back next year. And we won't think twice about returning to the Sheraton.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delaware, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cDream location!\u201d", "Author": "Mike O", "ReviewID": "UR115388717", "Content": "We stayed here for our Honeymoon, June 19 2011 for the entire week.

We had a wonderful time! I have been taking some time to write a thoughtful review. I will review the resort first and then give you all some hints and tips based on my experiences in Maui. First off, we flew to HI from VA and that was an EXTREMELY long day!!! We arrived at the hotel at about 3:45pm their time which was our bedtime in VA. I had read some reviews that ragged on the folks at the check in/out counter. I have nothing but compliments for this bunch of ladies. Our check in was flawless and they let us check out at 12pm instead of 11am due to our late flight out that evening. On to the room. We traveled as a party of five, 3 in one room and 2 in another. Our rooms were side by side as requested. The rooms are not outstanding by any means but were very clean and fresh. Some of the furniture was \"dated\" as other folks have mentioned, but again, nothing to complain about really. I did have one peeve about our room though. The patio door was VERY hard to open. I am 6 ft 3 in and 290 lbs and it took all my might to open it sometimes. We were in Bldg 3 on the first floor. This was a great location which was close to the lobby and the pool/Black Rock area. We found a parking lot right behind our building which was a great time saver. The grounds of the resort are amazing. NO trash, lawns that looked and felt like putting greens and beautiful flowers everywhere. One other minor complaint pertains to the pool and HOT tub. The HOT tub was VERY HOT!!!! I like them hot but this one was on the verge of pain! I would guess 104-105 degrees most of the time. Ironically, the pool was VERY cold!!! Shockingly cold!!! Funny enough though, the temperatures in Maui the whole time we were there were 81-87 with breezes most days so yeah, I guess the pool should be a little chilly...dunno. We had no issues with the towel cards. After the first exchange, you just dumped your old towels in a bin and they give you new ones....easy as that. We ate at the poolside restaurants several times. The one closer to the lobby was more like standard bar food (cheeseburgers, pork tacos, chips and salsa, etc). The one closer to Black Rock served a number of \"healthier\" items which I liked better. Highly recommend the fruit BOWL --lots of fresh fruit and the Turkey/Avocado wrap--yummy! Both places were pricey but good and convenient when you are too tired to go out. My son and I ate the breakfast buffet on our last morning before flying out. It was high quality but $24.95 per person...YIKES!!! We knew all this going in so we were ready to \"take it in the shorts\" for food. I highly suggest going to the Safeway for drinks,snacks, breakfast food, etc. Sign up for their Safeway membership! Its free and saves you a ton of money. Their bakery is amazing! We ate at Lulu's one night (next door to Safeway) and their are some fast food choices inside the Cannery Mall (again, next to Safeway). A bit farther toward the airport is Lahaina. There are a number of places to eat there. We loved Moose McGillicuddy's and Cheeseburger in Paradise was good too. There is a neat little Gellato shop next to the Cheeseburger. Try their Pineapple flavor--amazing! Onto the excursions---Our first one was with Atlantis Submarine tour. I had declined this choice in St Thomas before because I thought it would be \"cheesy\". $99 per adult/teen and worth every penny. The staff was hilarious and they kept us laughing 90% of the time! We saw a Spotted Eagle Ray and a White Tip Reef Shark--very cool. The next day we went on a helicopter tour of Maui. This was the highlight of our trip! We saw 80 to 90% of the island. We saw Oprah's road to her home....the home was not visible...We went over the volcano on Maui and into several old crater openings. If you get car sick, you might want the think twice about doing this. 3 of us (me included) got a bit green at the very end when we circled inside of what looked like a 20 foot across hole in the top of a mountain. Our last trip was a day to Pearl Harbor, the USS Missouri and a tour of Honolulu. We flew over to Oahu, were picked up by bus by our tour guide and he shipped us to Pearl Harbor. This was a great experience! I learned soooo much! The tour of the USS Missouri was cool too but it was very hot and we were getting tired quickly...The rest of the tour was Waikiki Beach and the Punch Bowl Cemetery. We got to see the parking lot where Hawaii 5-0 keeps their set cars and stuff. We wanted to take a trip over to the Big Island but it was sold out =(. We set up all of these trips through the concierge at the lobby area. Thanks for all your help! We chose the Sheraton because of all the great comments about the snorkeling. It was fantastic. You can walk out 5 feet and see fish all around you from above the water. I really wanted to swim with the turtles and they delivered. Hint, they showed up daily at about 11am and stayed for several hours. We saw anywhere from 2 a day up to 5 on our last full day. That was incredible!!! They will swim right with you in fact one swam right under me from behind. Just respect them and they will hang around you more. Some idiots boxed them in at the rocks and dove down to touch them all over. People are stupid....don't be one of them please. I hope this write up of my trip will give you some insight, ideas and general info you will need if you stay here. If my body can handle the flights, I will definitely stay here again.

We had made the reservation many months ago using our Starwood points. We arrived a little after the rush of check-ins because we were delayed at the airport for awhile (my problem, not the airline or airport). So when we arrived at about 5:30, there was only one person ahead us for check-in. Check-in went great, everything was in order. I like the way the desk clerk personally escorts you to the bell stand. No chance to get lost or have a misunderstanding about where the room is located. While checking in we were offered an upgrade to an ocean front room (I think that is what it is called). Man, I am glad we decided to pay the extra. We had a room on the 4th floor of building 6 - looking right out on the ocean. We enjoyed the sunset while enjoying a drink on our lanai. Worth every penny of the upgrade. My son checked in a day after we did, and he got a room in the same building (first floor) at no extra cost. Talk about being friendly to the customer. Building 6 does have a couple of good and bad features. It very close ot the exercise room which was great. It has its own parking lot which is convenient, but it is too small to accommodate all of the cars. So people were parking in no parking areas, along the drive, etc. I noticed that these all had notes on them every morning but I didn't hear anything about cars being towed. Guess we were lucky as we found a spot every time. The downside is that Building 6 is located a good long walk from everything else. Up (or down) an elevator in Bldg 6, across a \"breezeway,\" up an elevator, a long walk through another building, done an elevator and finally you are on ground level, near the pool. But -- the view we had was worth the extra walk. The room was good - nice bed, nice size, good lanai. Bathroom was ver nice, large, clean. No wireless Internet but the wired Internet was fine. The only complaint is that the chaise lounge in the room was the most uncomfortable chair I have ever sat in. Added some pillows and cushions from other chairs to make it usable. We ate the outside \"Dive Bar\" (I guess rather than \"dive\" bar) several times. Food was always good and service excellent. We had appetizers and drinks one night at the inside bar. Again good. Prices were a bit high but not so bad when comparing to other top resorts. For example, a Manhattan was $10, and they Maker's Mark bourbon. I only had breakfast at the indoor dining room. At $28 it was pricey but there was a great selection of fruit, juices, eggs and all of the other items expected on a buffet. A really great diversion during our stay was a tour of the kitchen followed by a cooking demonstration. We met the executive chef by the main dining room and were lead throughout the entire kitchen. Everything was open to us - all of the walk-in freezers and refrigerators, all areas of food preparation, the storage area where incoming food is stored,the staff cafe. We toured entire facility while the chef explained how everything worked. Then we moved to the on-site Japanese restaurant where the sous chef prepared fish, vegetables, etc in a cooking demonstration. Everyone there got plenty to eat. There was also a large display of local fruit which the chef discussed then provided samples for all to taste, plus we could take whatever fruit we wanted. All of this in about an hour at no cost! If you are at all interested in cooking or eating, this tour is worth it. The tours occurs a couple of days a week (I think) and you do not need to make reservations. One last comment. Like many others have said, the location within walking distance of Whaler's Village was great. We ate several times there (at the Hula Grill and Leilani's mainly, my wife and daughter-in-law had a bad experience at Cane and Taro). We found all of the staff to pleasant and helpful. The calls for the time share presentations were a little annoying but those who called were very nice. We did get a couple of shopping bags and boxes of candy plus a nice bag/backpack thing that came in very handy.

And it was worth it, the room was right there by the water, absolutely gorgeous. The employees were extremely friendly too. But the next day, my husband saw on our bank account that the hotel had charged us $1500 we kind of freaked out, since that was almost all we had in our account! The woman at the front desk was very blase about it, and told us that, because of our charge the previous night, the system assumed that we would be spending an average of $250 a day at the resort and put a hold on our card for the week's amount. We were stunned and told her we wanted the hold taken off, so she went and talked to the manager and came out and told us he was going to send our bank the paperwork to reverse the charges. To make a long story short, after many attempts at talking to the manager when our money still wasn't back in our account, we finally were able to talk to the guest services manager who was very friendly and the first person to actually be apologetic about the whole thing. She resent the paperwork just to be safe, gave us breakfast vouchers and a comped dinner. Our money finally showed up again, and we were able to continue our vacation.

This is a good solid hotel. But its not up to the price per night. and then to add 25.00 resort fee a night. Went Zip lining in Kapalua- had a great time. Very fun and safe. Went ATV trip with Waterslide- not really atv (you just drive up a mountain) and too cold on top of mountain to do the waterslide. Went to other side of island to Mendez Ranch to horseback ride- ride and views were incredible but you have to hope you get a good horse. (i did not). If you get a good horse you will have an amazing ride. Extra note- YOU MUST TRY CHESSEBURGER IN PARADISE IN LAHAINA FOR BREAKFAST-THE VERY BEST AND ABOUT $20.00 for 2 people DRUMS OF THE PACIFIC LUAU AT MARRIOTT BUBBA GUMP RESTAURANT IN LAHAINA- GREAT FOOD AND REASONABLE PRICES My husband and i are very active and are 56 and 52.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cAdditional Charges are Ridiculous!

We stayed in the nicer area of the resort, so we were only treated badly until they found out our room number (I hate to imagine the experience others would have with an average room). Also, they will put holds on your account if you charge anything to your room account. For example, if you buy a $10 drink it is times by the number of days you are staying there, so $10 x 7 days = a $70 hold on your account. We payed for our activities through the resort and they held nearly $5,000 on our bank account. Thank goodness we found this out before we went out on the town! Another side note- DO NOT GO TO THE EAST PART OF MAUI!!! This would be a big mistake if you do go to the other end of the island.

I was able to get another room (I had to pay an extra 50 a night to do this) that had what I wanted. Not the end of the world but was not what I had booked. The new room I had was perfect for me, in an area of the hotel called Hale Moana, which had beautiful views and was away from all the activity of the pool etc, but was a significant walk from the front of the hotel (which I loved but others may find it a bother). Furthermore, it had its own parking lot (a huge bonus). Ok this may sound like a nickpicky but both rooms they had given me had a lot of chips from the furniture. Everything had chips, the chairs, drawers, lamps etc, and they just looked old and used, and for $400+ a night I would have expected better furniture. I guess the linens were good (which is probably more important then the furniture). One more thing that was a little against what they indicated that was included in the booking was they had free internet, however it was only available in \"hotspots\", not in our room.

The lady upgraded us to a partial ocean view for free. Once we got to the room I must say we were a bit disappointed, first of all the room was quite small especially for being a partial ocean view which most people would have paid more for. The balcony/lanai was not even a balcony. It was a foot wide, just enough to stand on and there were no chairs or table. We were very disappointed since we love to sit out there and eat breakfast and read etc... That night we decided we were going to ask if there were any rooms with a large balcony, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking for a free upgrade, just an equivalent room with a bigger balcony. The lady at the front desk looked and looked and finally said she could get us an ocean view room that was 100 sqft larger with a balcony at no charge. The only thing was we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go into the new room until the next day. We were very pleased with this. So the next day they called our cell phone around 10:00am and said the room was ready. We got to the new room and let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say we were very happy and that we were impressed with the Sheraton at this point. The room was much nicer and larger, the balcony was perfect. The view was awesome! To say the least they had hooked us up and done us right and we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complaining or anything, just looking for a better balcony. The room came with an HD-TV and HD service, a small fridge and Internet. Of course you pay a $25 resort fee, but the Internet and self parking was included in that so that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t so bad. The pool and hotel grounds were beautiful. They had free floating bean bags that you could use in the pool, they were first come first serve. The food at the pool was very expensive.

First off, the Travelocity package rates for this 4* property were actually cheaper than the 3* condos and hotels in the area.

Our room was essentially on top of Black Rock and a 30 second elevator ride from the beautiful winding pool (it is not just a square watering hole like most of the hotels on the Ka'anapali strip). No the pool is not heated - but it gets ridiculously hot in Maui and I appreciated being able to cool off! The resort grounds were absolutely stunning. The public beach directly in front of the hotel was crowded on weekends, however, we were able to walk 5 minutes to the other side of black rock and avoid the crowds (and still see lots of fish snorkeling). Whaler's village was a convenient ten minute walk, and a great spot for happy hour! The hotel shuttle was air conditioned, always on time, and a great option for getting into Lahaina. My only complaints (and these are very minor) are: (1) It can be hard to get a spot at the pool because guests put their towels on the beach chairs in the morning and then don't come back until the afternoon. This is against the hotel's stated policy and the staff really should be cracking down on it! (2) There are no reasonably priced food options on site, however that was to be expected. We did eat and drink at the Mai Tai Bar and the Cliff Dive Bar a few times and the food and drinks were quite good but at $10 per drink and $16 for a sandwich it's not something we could afford to do every day.

Two things to keep in mind: when you book through sites like Travelocity, you are not promised and cannot request a particular type of bed. We were told it would be two double beds whether we took the upgrade or kept our original resort view. If a king bed is important to you, book through the Sheraton site, though you'll pay a lot more money. Second, when they offer the upgrade, ask questions and don't be afraid to make requests or refuse the upgrade. We were given a room on the ground floor at upgrade, which I did not want as it offers no view of the ocean. I asked if there was anything on another floor, and was given a 3rd floor room, which we were satisfied with. Upgrade rooms are a bit larger and are also right behind where the hotel's luau takes place - fairly noisy, but over early (from 5ish-9 pm) and appears to take place only twice per week.

Housekeeping does okay, not great, but sufficient. We ignored the \"free gift\" messages on our phone as we knew it was a time share presentation ploy.

The service at the Sheraton was very good throughout my trip. (Claudia and Tonya at the Mai Tai bar are really great.) It seemed to me like the service was improved from my last stay. Many people comment on how expensive food or drinks are at the Sheraton and other places in Maui, etc. First of all, it's Hawaii, things cost more. Second of all, I paid fairly close to the same for the food and drinks I had in Maui as I would at home when going out to decent places. I plan for all costs when planning for my trip, so I guess it's no big deal to me. I think it depends on how you vacation. I say don't worry about it and just relax and have fun. However, I will admit that I don't love the resort fee being a separate charge, I would prefer if it was worked into the cost of the room. (And Sheraton, if you read this, no need to tell me what's included, I already know. I just don't like how it's separate; tuck it into the cost of the room!) The room was clean and the grounds are very nice. The rooms are in need of refreshing. Not terrible by any stretch, they just seem ready for some sprucing up, they look a little tired. I booked an ocean view room and was upgraded to an ocean front room in building 6. The view was amazing, especially the sunset. If you like to sit on the lanai sometimes and just take it all in and relax, it's perfect. It is a bit of a trek from the lobby, the beach or the pool to building 6, (three elevators later) but the payoff is the view and how serene it is.

We got a great deal on vacation though Orbitzs so we did not have high expectations given the great deal and some of the review on trip advisor. However, I must say this was a great vacation and cannot think of one thing to complain about. 1. Check in was great, quick and easy and recieved a wonderful view of ocean and king sized bed (what we had booked) it had a small balcony but was fine for two people. 2. The room looked just like the website, clean and had everything you needed. Also the mini refrigerator was larger than I thought had and room for snacks, water, soda, etc They provide shampoo, conditioner, body wash, loofa, lotion. The was always cleaned and tidy by the time we came back from the pool 3. Service - was great everyone was helpful. We asked for extra pillows and they delivered them to our room in 5 mins. We ordered room service twice and both times came quickly. 4. Beach/Pool - This was the best part of the resort!! The pool was big and clean and had two sections connected by a lazy river, which was fun to float on with the bean bags. (they have these floating bean bags which were fun and comfortable). The drink service was great and checked on us regularly. The beach in front of the Sheraton was best part of the Kaanapali beach. It was wide with clear water and the snorkleing was great around Black Rock. I had no issue with the towel cards that some have complained about. Also, I saw on Trip advisor alot of people complain about the wrist bands they ask you to wear around the pool however given that Black is so popular they had to find away to \"police\" non guests from just walking up and using the pool/chairs. I must rather wear a wrist band but have a chair and service around the pool area and the workers were very nice and professional when they apporach you to wear a wrist band. Also, had a message at the spa and it was THE BEST one I have ever had.

We had a room right next to the elevator and I thought the sound might be a problem, but we loved the view from the room, so we decided to give it try for a night. While we would hear the elevator during the day, it was not a problem at night. The room was very comfortable. We ate the breakfest buffet almost every morning and we thought that it was good. We ate lunch at both pool bars and the food was good.......I would recommend the pork tacos! Even though the drinks from the pool bars were a little expensive......they were really good! Snorkeling at Black Rock was AWESOME! I saw sea turtles almost every day. All of the staff that we encountered were friendly and helpful! This is a large resort, so the walk to the parking garage can be long, especially after a long day, but if it is that big of a deal, just use the valet.

It's a short walk to Whalers village and other nearby restaurants. Every hotel employee we passed had a friendly smile and greeting which I really appreciated. The hotel feels very spacious and set back from the beach a bit and didn't feel cramped, crowded or claustrophic like some of the other hotels we passed. Yes, the water pressure was weaker and the room decor was a bit old fashioned but that didn't bother us at all.

Maybe people paid rack rate and that's why they're mad? We got a great deal on priceline and we definitely got our money's worth. Very nice hotel - definitely sprawling, and if you are staying in one of the outer buildings it might be a 5 min walk to the lobby or something. I cannot believe people are complaining about this. Have Americans gotten so lazy/fat a 5 min walk is worth bashing a hotel over? In our particular building (3), we had no problems with the shower, furnishings, or loud neighbors. Felt like the two of us had plenty of space...and we came because I am 7 months pregnant with our first child. The bathroom wasn't too small for me and my belly. Haha. Funny that during our stays in both Maui and Kauai where we did plenty of snorkeling, the best snorkeling was at Black Rock right outside the hotel. Definitely more crowded mid-day, but we went sometimes multiple times a day and it never felt TOO crowded. We brought our own snorkeling gear so I can't speak to rental rates. All of the employees were super helpful and kind. One of the concierges in particular was really helpful at giving me a running route. It was a great six mile run along the ocean to go from the Sheraton to Lahaina and back on the beach path and then through some parks. I guess it is a quiet hotel at night...but aren't people in Hawaii to relax? Go to Lahaina or one of the other towns for nightlife. Even Whaler's village right down the beach path has stuff going on at night. I'm not sure what people expect the hotel to provide after 7 or 8pm at night other than a restaurant for dinner, but we liked being able to relax in our room if we had a long day out doing stuff without tons of noise or lots of parties. Didn't eat at the restaurants so I can't comment on quality...I always laugh at people who complain about hotel food prices. Seriously? EVERY hotel is going to have super overpriced food. That's why you eat out in town, or go to the grocery store beforehand at least for breakfast and snack foods. If you are going to be non-adventurous, or at least lazy enough to stay put at the hotel the ENTIRE TIME, then yes - plan on paying a premium for convenience. Speaking of, we didn't find any restaurants we would particularly recommend...but we also aren't big on chowing down either. Lots of times we ate fruit for dinner. The only thing I could complain about would be the internet hookup. At this point, lots of people travel with more portable laptops that don't have ethernet. Since we were paying the resort fee (which i don't have a problem with), it was slightly annoying that the only in-room option for internet was an ethernet hookup, which our iPad didn't have an adapter for. I have to believe many travelers at this point would be in the same position. More widespread wifi would be preferable. That being said, at least there was free wifi in the lobby which was fine....it's not like we're in Maui to be online all day. Overall, great stay. Don't be hesitant to stay here. Had I paid rack rate I might just be satisfied instead of impressed, but still a nice hotel. And, who even pays rack rate anymore anyway? Also, great pool.

I generally get 3 or 4 massages a month due to neck and back issues, and her treatment was as good if not better than \"master body workers\" here at home.

There was some sort of entertainment each evening around sunset, the photos at sunset from the 3rd floor by reception were awesome! The walkway that runs near the beach is a wonderful opportunity for a healthy walk without sand on your feet! I snorkled right off the beach and it was pretty cool. I saw the usual little fish that I enjoy, and also a turtle. All in all we found this to be the best experience in our island hopping vacation. Next time it's Denver to Maui to stay.

The Sheraton was beautiful, the grounds impeccable, very clean, directly on the beach, they upgrade you to a better room for free. The rooms are spacious and clean. The only thing I must comment on about the rooms; the water in the shower runs from warm to cold to hot to cold, not in that order but you get the idea. The rooms have been updated everywhere but the shower, the tile and tub need to be replaced, not bad but you can tell it wasn't updated with everything else. The staff at the self parking garage left alot to be desired. They were very rude and not helpful, if your key didn't work to lift the gate they became very agitated. The front desk staff was very friendly as we had to have 4 sets of keys made because of the parking garage incidents. The pool activites guy we dealt with was Austin a very nice young man. If you want a gazebo by the pool, which is very nice to have, the rent for a full day is $75, Austin was nice enough to inquire about renting for half the day from 1 to 8pm and got us what we wanted for $40, he was extremely nice and great to talk with. The spa was nice, very expensive but if you get 2 treatments you get 10% off of the total. Inga, the massage therapist was phenominal, very basic though, shower, robe, massage room partially open air. A couple things I think people should know. The snorkling is great there when you can get in the water without being right on top of someone. Rent your snorkle gear in Lahaina it is much cheaper, around $10 a day compared to $8 an hour from the resort. We ended up going to a spot the guy at the dive shop suggested, Napili beach it is a public beach but is spread out I had no problem snorkling there, lots of sea turtles and fish, the turtles are very acclamated to people so they will let you swim with them. GO TO Safeway on the way to the resort. Everything is super expensive, we had 2 iced teas, 2 cocktails and an order of pork tacos (2 tacos with chips and a very small cup of salsa), $8 for tip the total was $63!! I am not cheap, in fact I am willing to spend good money on food but this was ridiculous. The breakfast buffet is pricey also $27.95 per person comes with coffee or O.J. I was shocked at the price but was extremely satisfied with the food. They had a full breakfast items from fruits, yogurt, muffins, bagels,bacon, sausage, potatoes, scrambled eggs. Also an omlette station was excellent, the breakfast buffet was great. I had an unbelievable omeltte at Moose McGullicuddys in Lahaina a must try place. While I am on food I will tell you that Cheeseburger in Paradise in a must, right on the water, friendly staff, great Banana smoothie. Leilani's at Whalers village for a nice sit down, white napkin dinner, food was wonderful. The locals swear by the Mixed Plate, there are several locations, local food. It was ok not great, could have skipped it. Of course Hawaii is expensive since everything must be imported in so figure on everything being double what you would pay for it on the Mainland.

We booked and paid in advance for a partial ocean view room but when we checked in we were advised we had been upgraded to an oceanfront suite in Building 6 (from memory, room 6111). Hooray! We had asked for an early check-in and when we arrived at around noon, our (upgraded) room was ready to go. The room was huge and had a king sized bed, microwave oven, bar fridge, coffee maker, chaise longue, writing desk and ample wardrobe and drawer space. The bed was so comfortable. We both enjoyed some really decent sleep for the first time in ages. Just to note that whilst we generally had a peaceful stay, I was woken in the early hours once by the couple next door \"enjoying\" their stay. So perhaps the walls are quite thin. Most days our room was serviced promptly; there was only one day when it wasn't done until late afternoon. Also, if you want turn-down service, you have to specifically request it from the front desk. The bathroom (with separate toilet) was also enormous with double sinks and a shower over a full-size bathtub. Towels and robes were plentiful and comfy, and the toiletries were good. Airconditioning was quiet and effective. It seemed to switch itself off if the sliding door to the lanai was open. The ground level patio (aka lanai) had a round table and two chairs plus a lounger. The lanai opened directly onto a grassed area accessible by other hotel guests so i didn't feel comfortable leaving the sliding door open overnight. The resort itself is enormous and spacious and offers direct beachfront access. The pool winds around the resort and offers a good mix of shallow and deeper parts. The jacuzzi is a bit small for the size of the resort - it would fit just 6 people comfortably. That said, perhaps there's not much call for a jacuzzi in Maui but the weather was quite poor most days we were there so it was nice to warm up after a dip in the ocean. The best part of our stay was swimming with the Green Sea turltes right off Black Rock. The absolute best time to see the turtles is very early morning. Most morning we were out there snorkelling by 7am, if not earlier. We were rewarded by seeing 5 (5!) sea turtles all swimming together just off the point of Black Rock. What beautiful creatures they are. Lots of cool tropical fish too. We hired our snorkel equipment (very good quality) from Maui Dive and Surf in Lahaina ($25 for the week) and they have a concession at Whaler's Village too. Other places charge up to $100 (!) for the week, so choose carefully. We ate breakfast one morning (very expensive, average quality) and ate at the bar one evening (food okay, again quite expensive). Other than that we ate out. The poolside bar made the best mojitos i drank anywhere on Maui or Oahu, and I drank quite a few! Definitely try one. We appreciated the courtesy shuttles around the Kaanapali area and also into Lahaina. They ran quite regularly and saved us lots. We caught a cab home from Lahaina one night and it cost $20 with tip. Smokers note: the smoke-free policy is rigourously policed. The security patrols were frequent, even at our secluded end of the complex. Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Maui and would definitely return. The room was confortable, the staff were friendly and pleasant and the facilities were good. Slight downsides included: - small jacuzzi - grumpy older pool-towel guy (no towel for you!) - being served cocktails and beer poolside in plastic cups. What the?! - the poolside bars close by 8pm and that main bar at 10pm. Um, why?! - similarly, room service closes at 10pm. - it's a long, long walk from building 6 to anywhere! - we didn't find out we could access the Internet free of charge from the hotel library for 45 minutes/day until the day before we left. - it rained every day, but there's not much the Sheraton could do about that!

We had left a bag of groceries out on the counter filled with bread, bagels, and munchies. When we woke up at 2:30 am to leave for the crater sunrise, I noticed that our bag of groceries was missing. So, I called the front desk and their response was that there was nothing they can do and if it was housekeeping I should have noticed the day before. My response to that was that we were out exploring the island the whole day and we came back to the hotel and went directly to bed as we had to get up at 2:30 am!! So after some back and forth, she agreed to talk to the manager in the morning and get back to us. So, off we went with empty stomaches and no place open to get food. We returned to the hotel at noon with no message from the manager, so we had to call again. My boyfriend was transferred to a couple of people with a couple of snarky comments like, 'How big was the bag of chips that was missing from the room?'. We finally got talking to someone who was apologetic after we explained to them the story and asked us what we wanted in return. We said that it isn't about the value of the food, it is about the inconvenience of having a bag of food mistakenly taken from our room, having to deal with this sort of conflict on a vacation, and obviously the fact that we were without food on a very early and long drive. She said that she would prepare a bag of food and send it to our room. About 4-5 hours later, a bag came with two waters, 2 juices, 2 small bags of chips, a box of chocolates, and two stale bagels. I was insulted!! First off, its the Sheraton and that is pathetic. Second, we should not have to recommend to them how we should be compensated, but obviously we should have.

To be told that there is nothing they can do about it, then having to follow up with them, be transferred from person to person, and then be compensated in that way, is unacceptable. I would think that they would offer a free breakfast, seeing that we didn't have one that morning due to their staff taking our food. But apparently we have different ideas of what customer service is. I am a pretty easy going person and I believe in karma, so I took this as a lesson learned about this hotel and said that i would pass it on to you.

And this hotel caters to their needs. The beach is nice (as the first hotel in the planned Kaanapali resort, they got the best beach), the heated lagoon pool is pleasant, the beach bars have good drinks, and there's plenty of decent (but expensive) food in the hotel restaurants. Rooms vary quite a bit (the hotel seems to have been built in stages over the past 45 years), and some rooms require a substantial hike from the front desk. But ever room I've had at the hotel has been nicely furnished, with some water view. As mentioned, the grounds of the hotel are nicely manicured, with large green lawns predominating. On a previous visit, it seemed like they had a more active entertainment program, especially for the kids, but they do still have some sort of daily Hawaiian-themed activity (lei making, hula, etc.). Every evening, a cliff diver lights the tiki torches and jumps off Black Rock (not THAT entertaining, but if you have a mai tai iin your hand . . .). There is excellent snorkeling around Black Rock, especially if you have the nerve to swim around it. The surf is usually calm, especially in the morning. But you should know what you're doing, and perhaps bring a flotation device if you're not an excellent swimmer. My wife had to \"rescue\" a woman who wasn't strong enough to swim back. There are no lifeguards patrolling. I think \"rookie\" Hawaii visitors will like staying at this hotel, but if you're the more adventurous type, you might find it a bit dull or sterile. I'd personally recommend soaking in a couple of days of Hawaiian sunshine and finding a more \"off the beaten path\" place (a house or cottage rental, perhaps?) to complete your Hawaiian vacation.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon Oregon", "Title": "\u201cMemories to last a life time!\u201d", "Author": "WorkmanFamily", "ReviewID": "UR107840011", "Content": "We just left Sheraton Maui Resort and Spa yesterday and I must say it would be hard to find anything bad to say about this beautiful property!

We took the snorkeling trip to Molokini but the best snorkeling of our entire trip was right here at Black Rock. We saw two huge sea turtles and a ton of other sea life.

Located right on Black Rock, the hotel had amazing snorkeling right off the beach and was just a short walk to Whalers Village and the yummy Hulu Grill. There were rainbows just about everyday and this being whale watching season, you could see whales right off the coast most days. My husband and I stayed here as part of an awards trip with his company. We have traveled to many places in the Carribean and Mexico and I think we had the same opinion as a lot of other people who have traveled a lot: the trip is very far if you're coming from the East Coast and it is very expensive once you get there. For example at the Cliff Dive Bar, the \"special\" for lunch was two pork tacos and a draft beer for $17. There is a rental fee per day ($40 if I recall correctly) for the beach chairs or cabanas (beach chairs with a canvas cover). Hotels that have towel cards are also frustrating. You can only get one towel per person and you have to keep track of turning the card in and getting it back by the end of the day. Another thing that drove me nuts was there was only free wifi in the lobby. We probably would have enjoyed Maui in general had we'd stayed for more than a week because there is so much to see and do around the island. Since there were company functions to attend almost everyday, our time was limited. Definitely carve out time to make the trip to Mama's Fish House. We had a late flight the day we were leaving so went there for lunch before the airport and it was incredible. For the hotel, the rooms needed updating badly. We were in a standard suite in Building 2 which had a ok view. The bath tubs were small and the room had very standard decor like you would see in any Sheraton in the US. The spa was just ok for recently undergone a renovation but either we weren't offered or they didn't have shower facilities. I kept waiting for them to tell us to slip into our bathrobes and enjoy the steam room or sauna but that never happened. We finished our massage all oily and were escorted to the front desk to settle our bill. Most of our food was buffet because we were with a big group and dinner was good with just a standard breakfast. There is absolutely nothing to do at the hotel at night.

Pros: The best location on Ka'anapali Beach, right in front of black rock with a choice of waves or calm, rocks or sand, cliff jumping or snorkelling, shade or sun, just unbeatable compared to the other resorts in the area. We saw sea turtles, as well as many varieties of colourful, large tropical fish while snorkelling directly in front of the hotel. Pool area is very laid back. Some quiet music playing, great sandwich/appy bar, great idea with the lava rock and waterfall grotta area. Very lovely. Beautiful afternoon live music leading up to and after the black rock diving ceremony. Gorgeous views from most rooms, looking out over the stunning beach/ocean views. Building #4 is your best bet for the standard ocean view room - you will have an amazing ocean view looking all the way down the beach. Rooms are spacious and well laid out. Dated? No, not really. Not everything can be brand new, and these rooms, while probably a few years from a refresh, are far from \"tired\" looking. Beds are fantastic. I haven't slept this well in years, and it didn't hurt to have the sliding door slightly ajar while the waves lap up against the beach as a nice sleep aid! We literally have contacted the hotel to determine the brand of mattress and pillows so we can buy them for our own bedroom back home! Lanais (balconeys) are huge. We had four full sized chairs seating four adults plus a table on ours one evening, with no space issues whatsoever. Property is gorgeously Hawaiian in a classic, understated fashion. Plenty of teak wood accents and soft coloured rock and stone, including a pleasant sandy rock pool deck - a pleasant change from most resorts' grey concrete. It took a day or two to get your bearings as the resort is quite large. The grassy lawn adds to the laid back, uncrowded feel of the whole environment in and around the property. We checked out the Westin down the beach twice and it always appeared loud, crowded and crammed in, although it as well was a nice looking proprty with a much more extravagant pool layout (if a little busy). Staff was superb, as the Hawaiians generally are a happy, friendly bunch. Check in took less than 3 minutes for two couples - a welcome efficiency after a long flight/drive. The complimentary chocolate macadamias and lei's were a nice touch to help us slip into \"Hawaiian Time\" right away. The hotel tram came in handy a couple of times to get to and from the Whaler's village and the other hotels. Driver will ring his bell at you as you're walking down the road, ask you where you are headed and offer you a ride. Again, nice touch. Restaurants on site: The steak house offered a first rate prime rib experience in a relaxed, lovely atmosphere lit up with tiki torches and soft lighting reflecting off cherry wood decor and tropical burbling brooks. Wine list very good. Food, very good, service, friendly, prompt, and never more than a few feet away. Conciege - very helpful in finding us availability for the whale watching/sunset cruise. First choice was sold out, and they found us another, excellent catamaran - the \"Gemini\". Cons: If you are a night owl, you will find this hotel decidedly quiet by about 10:30pm. We arrived at around that time, and were ripe for a sit down cocktail, only to find the entire place was shut down, even the \"late night\" bar. But no biggie - early mornings in Hawaii are brilliant, so we just got with the program and became \"morning people\" - up at 6:30 and asleep by 11. It really is the best way to experience Hawaii anyway. But if you insist, there are restaurants and bars open much later just a stone's throw away at the other hotels, Whaler's Village or Lahaina.

The hotel is on an old mature property and has been well maintained. The grounds are well maintained and so are buildings. Bottom line for my review is: I would only recommend this hotel to families coming to Hawaii. If you are not bringing your kids with you, I would suggest another hotel or even another island. For families, the hotel is great with a small lazy river, two pools, and a small waterslide. My wife and I were not here with our kids so therefore the hotel was just ok for us. Additionally, the hotel seems to be a hot spot for corporate sponsored events. This is something you should watch out for if you are planning a trip here. Rooms: The rooms are pretty nice for a Sheraton. In some cities in the US the rooms in the Westin are comparable. They are clean and look as though they have been updated. We had an ocean front room on the second floor. It had a nice view and you could see the ocean in the distance. Our room was quiet but my wife complained about the bed each night. She would wake up stiff in the morning from the hard springy mattress. Pool: The pool was nice and we sat by the pool most days. I should note that the pool is crowded compared to other resorts we have been to around the world. This is the type of pool where you will be sitting directly next to someone else and you will hear everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s conversations. So if you are looking for some R&R by the pool, bring your headphones. There are two pools, a shallow one and a deep (8 ft) one. There is drink service around the pool area so you can get a beer or cocktail while lying around. There is a guy walking around to check you are staying at the resort and giving out wristbands. For some reason people seem to dread wearing the wristbands. I personally think people need to relax put on the wristband and drink a beer. The guy who gives they bands out is the nicest guy working at the hotel. Beach: The beaches in Hawaii are all public beaches so you will not just have hotel guests on the beach. For some reason, most of the people at the hotel seemed to stay around the pool. Overall, the beach is nice but the small size and course sand are some negatives. You will find much nicer beaches all over the Caribbean. You can do some snorkeling off the beach near the rocks, but there are too many people out there for my taste. You are better off taking a snorkeling boat trip available through the hotel or one of the many vendors near by. Bar Scene: There is no bar scene whatsoever here. All the bars seem to close very early and it is difficult to find a drink after 10pm. The best bar we were able to find was the Hula Grill in Whalers Village but it also closes very early. If you are looking for a nightlife, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t come to Maui. Oahu is your best bet. Location: The hotel sits in a pretty good location about 45-50 mins drive from the airport. From the hotel you can plan whale watching, which I highly recommend. We did it and love it. You can also schedule day cruises and snorkeling trips. This area of the island does not have the high-end feeling of the Wailea area if that is what you are looking for. The area where the Sheraton sits in Kaanapali feels very touristy to me. It is one of those planned resort areas with 5-8 hotels and timeshares lined up surrounded by a golf course. It is close to the shops and restaurants in Lahaina. My wife and I enjoyed walking around Lahaina looking at the tourist shops, getting a drink, and some food. Restaurants: The food and especially fish in Hawaii is excellent. We ate dinner each night outside the hotel area. We went to The Banyan Tree at the Ritz Carlton the first night. The food was excellent, as was the view. We went on Wednesday since it was half price wine night. Another night we went to Lahaina Grill in the little town area of Lahaina. The food there was also excellent. The third night we went to a Luau Party hosted by the Sheraton. The food was good and we enjoyed ourselves. The last restaurant I can remember was the Sansei Seafood Restaurant in Kapalua near the Ritz Carlton. This was some of the best sushi we had in a long time. For lunch each day, I recommend the Hula Grill in Whalers Village. This is a short walk from the hotel and has great food and drinks.

It is a little on the expensive side as far as hotels go but we loved it. It is a great spot right on Black Rock. If you want to walk out of your room and right on to the beach to go snorkeling this is the place for you. We love snorkeling and I wanted to just stay close to the hotel. Seeing the island last time I didn't feel the need to drive the whole island this time. Black Rock is the best place to snorkel. Early in the morning is the best time. If you go out around the outside of the rock into the open and hold your breath and listen you can hear the whales sing. Wow! Highlight of our trip. Rooms are nice and we had a great view. They will upgrade you for free when you check in. If your a starwood member the rooms have a perfect view of the ocean. If you stay here you should experince the swimming pool. Love it but alot of people put down their towels to save their chairs and then come back whenever they want. You are not allowed to hold chairs but some guest due. I think it is rude. Food here is of course expensive. We had a small refrigrator in our room. We ended up buying lunch supplies at the local grocery store and made sandwiches for lunch and also bought something for breakfast then we only had to spend money of dinner. There is a resort fee here which makes no sense what so ever. To me that was the biggest thing, just include it in the price.

I get that it is a public beach, but WHERE are we supposed to put our stuff! we had to leave our stuff on the sand, while watching it and take quick dips in the beach.. it was really annoying. There were also snorkle rentals, which were also overpriced. The pool was also nice, and had a small slide - no real complaints there. They did come around giving us wristbands, which I put on my bathing suit so I wouldn't get tan lines. The hotel provided a free shuttle to Lahaina where we would go for dinner. That was convenient. Black Rock restaurant - decent, but very overpriced! They also had a cafe on the pool which had lunch items which were also overpriced! The spa was great - got a couples massage on the beach... a definite plus. We also did the luau, which was decent as well, but not much in terms of shows or a nightlife!!

We considered a condo on Ka'anapali, but came to the realization that we wouldn't really be doing any cooking and the amenities at a nice hotel would be worth it. The location is about perfect as the beach is very wide in front of the property and comes up against Black Rock which is great for snorkeling. Although it was fairly windy, the waves were not too big and the body surfing/boogie boarding was great for my 8 yr old. It does get a bit crowded on the beach, but since it's a public beach there's nothing that the hotel can do about it, and it highlights how popular the location is. We had requested two connected rooms, but were only able to be accommodated with two adjacent rooms. Not a big deal as we had wonderful ocean front rooms with great views from the lanais across the main lawn and pool area into the sea with Molokai in the distance. The rooms were quite spacious and clean, with nice amenities like a full mini fridge and LCD TVs for the kids. The breakfast buffet was quite expensive, but convenient the first morning, and we ended up getting up and going into Lahaina most mornings to search out a few breakfast spots. The pool is great as it isn't just a typical rectangle, but rather a winding rocky pool with waterfalls and a small slide, which was much more interesting and fun for the kids. We didn't do the luau, but the kids took part in the lei making and hula lessons. There's also whale watching excursions on large catamarans that launch next door through Trilogy Excursions, which was a great experience.

I wanted to ride bike down Haleakala. After much research of accoms on Maui, we opted for Sheraton as it seemed Black Rock had some of the best, easily accessible snorkeling right on beach. There is really no coral but the waters abounded with fish from only a foot or two off the beach. There was a little swell but nothing dangerous. We regularly swam out towards point but not past it. We arrived early afternoon and Erick - a very friendly and informative member of the concierge staff showed us to a beautiful double ocean view room. He also gave us suggestions of other snorkelling spots. Our room wasn't right on beach but view across gardens, pool, swaying palms beach and sunset over Lanai Island all seen from our relaxing lanai was hard to leave at the end of our stay. We did have noisy neighbours with a screaming kid, but we did not come to stay in our room all day. Our room was spacious and I think the bathroom may have recently been renovated. Our room was spotless every day. My only complaint was that the bed was too soft - I have lower back problems which were excacerbated by it. I had a brilliant full body massage at the spa - my back was sore after we bumped over ocean in dive boat the day before. Samantha has magic fingers and understood my ailments perfectly. She fixed my back enough to last the remainder of our holiday - another week involving much activity on Oahu and Big Island. The grounds are beautifully manicured and the pool area is very attractive. The pics of pool on website do not do it justice as it winds through the gardens allowing for numerous secluded spots in which to relax. If you're into kids clubs where you 'dump' your kids then I agree perhaps not as attractive for some young families but our 16 yr old son loved it. (Also know that when he was little he would have loved it, too). There are fresh water showers at the beach's edge where one can clean sand off before heading back to room. (We travel with our own snorkel gear, but one can hire gear by the beach). We enjoyed how the resort is spread over a large area - it doesn't feel closed in and its great to go for a walk esp after large meals. We found breakfast to be delicious and the range of foods was spectacular. Fresh fruits abounded and the service was friendly and efficient. The longest we waited for a table was probably about 5 mins. We had dinner one night in the Reefs Edge lounge and enjoyed a light, tasty dinner. Most nights we ate out at either Lahaina or at Whalers Village (best meals at Cane & Taro). My actual birthday was our last day/evening of our stay here and so decided to book dinner at the Black Rock Steak & Seafood Restaurant. Would have liked to try the teppanyaki but it was closed for renovations. Unfortunately it poured rain all day and evening and the restaurant was more busy than any other night. Sadly our 7pm booking became a 7:20 sitting , our order finally taken at 7:50pm and food arrived at 8:45pm! The food unfortunately was the worst we had experienced during the week - fish dry and chewy steak tough but son enjoyed pasta. There were lots of cross customers. The staff (not many there) were trying their best and didn't stop apologising. It wasn't their fault. Management should consider that they do not sit customers at tables half an hour before a booking is due to arrive. Our usual experience at restaurants is that we are informed if the table is booked for a later time so that we are aware that we must leave by then. It was the only dampener to our stay. We are not fans of a resort tax but one can hardly complain as it is very well publisized. As we had a hire car for our stay, we enjoyed free parking. Our son is a mad, keen gamer and enjoyed the free wi-fi in the evenings. It was useful for us too to stay in touch with home and to double check websites of tours we discovered whilst there. We actually took advantage of the free ph calls a couple of times, too. We were lucky to have a special rate of 3 nights for the price of two. We stayed for 8 nights. Should have stayed 9. Breakfast for two was included. This was provided by vouchers. As we had a few very early mornings where we did not eat breakfast at hotel, we were able to use our spare vouchers for our son so never had to pay for breakfast for him. All the concierge staff were very helpful and suggested some lovely dining in Lahaina (try Kimos and if you're into burgers, try Cool Cat). We even dodged the time share spiel.

Our chief dissatisfaction was that our room was supposed to be with \"ocean view\" but when we checked in, we were given a room where not only was there absolutely no view of the ocean from inside the room, it was on the ground floor. So when we opened the curtain, instead of seeing any ocean we see a lawn with a half naked man walking outside about 10m away. On taking our issue with the front desk, we were told that we would see the ocean IF we stepped out to the balcony, and were given some baloney that Ocean Front was a higher rate, and for the rate we paid, that was the so-called Ocean View we got. For the record, we paid about USD570 a night (no breakfast), which makes it more expensive than Shangri La hotel in downtown Tokyo. They switched us to another room, telling me that it would be a better view (real ocean view this time?), but it turned out to be just on one floor up higher, and still the same facing where you would see basically the hotel building on the other side when you look out. Not sure why they designed the hotel layout this way - basically the corridor walkway had the best view facing the beach and ocean, and the rooms at least in the building we were (building 2) basically faced rooms in the opposite building. Since we were misled that we would be having 'ocean view' and now did not have any, and the hotel's 'Ocean Front' rooms were already booked out so they have 'no choice' (otherwise Westin Maui was an alternative nearby) we basically started our holiday in Maui and week in Hawaii on a bad experience. The duty manager said she cannot adjust the rate now because we paid through a third party travel site, but did give us complimentary breakfast for 2 days for which we used 1. In summary, the dislikes (-) and likes (+) are: (-) No ocean view from room despite paying for one (-) The 3rd floor is actually the level which you drive your car in, and where reception is on. Eventually we were put in room 2310, which is on the \"3rd floor\" but it is actually like ground floor, because 2nd floor and ground floor were even lower (-) Car park building not very accessible from the hotel. Essentially you have to walk out all the way to the main road and then walk in to the car park. Not sure why they didn't just open a side entrance to it when it is side by side (-) Air conditioning unit in the room was noisy (-) Low water pressure in the shower (-) Nobody helped us with getting our luggage to the front desk when we unloaded from the rental car at the driveway, and vice versa when we checked out; valets were probably more interested to earn tips parking your car in the driveway (-) Internet access in the common area was just 1 terminal with no seat (+) Hotel restaurant helped us to cook a few fishes that we caught from a boat fishing trip, despite being busy with a corporate event (took a bit of cajoling).

If you are coming to Maui for whale watching, you almost don't need to go on a boat if you have a great view like this. Klint Kolbu in the Catering Dept. is just a beautiful person, so kind and helpful, I highly recommend special events here at the property.

That was not our experience at all. Quite the opposite - we found every staff member warm, helpful, and generous with their time. Our 9 year-old daughter loved the hula lesson, and crafts. Grace, the hula dancer, was so kind and friendly with the kids and adults alike. The front desk staff gave us the scoop on where the locals eat breakfast (No. 1 BBQ in the nearby town - fabulous hole-in-the-wall food). Thanks to staff recommendations we went horseback riding, took a submarine ride, had a hike in the extraordinary Iao valley, and visited the Up Country. In short, everyone went out of their way to be helpful and kind. As for the hotel itself, it exceeded our expectations (which were lowered, in part, because of some of the rather negative reviews on Tripadvisor). It was lovely, very attractive in design and finish. It felt like a high-end Thai hotel, and a big step up from some of the concrete boxes along the beach. The location is first-rate, with good snorkeling (though watch out for the currents and no lifeguards). My daughter spent hours and hours swimming in the pool and winding waterways on the hotel grounds. Honestly, what's not to like about the place? Well, the $28 breakfast buffet for one, which we simply avoided. Just how much breakfast buffet can any human eat? Instead we simply drove the three miles into the town and ate in excellent, cheap and locally-supported places. We did eat from time to time in the hotel, and had several poolside drinks, but doing so much would have burned through our budget (and we preferred to do other things with our money, frankly). What else? The hotel's Lu-au looked a bit lame, so we opted instead for the Drums of the Pacific at another hotel down the beach, which was recommended by several local dancers, and was indeed a good show (we got big discounts by sitting through a timeshare-style presentation - I wouldn't recommend that to anyone! Oh well, we all make mistakes). In conclusion, a lovely, tasteful hotel, beautifully designed and renovated, with a real Asian rather than concrete-block American sensibility; friendly staff, who will offer excellent suggestions if asked (we actually found the front desk staff more helpful at suggesting \"local\" cheaper options than the concierge folks); nice clean and tastefully decorated rooms; delightful grounds; great pool; fabulous location - best location by far of any hotel on the beach. It was, in short, a brilliant vacation. Thank goodness the complaining doomsayers on Tripadvisor were off the mark. This place is amongst the best hotels we have stayed, in decades of international travel all over the globe. It's a jewel. As is Maui.

This is the 2nd year in a row we have chosen this resort for our group's stay and both I and our passengers have been thrilled with this resort each time. (we had previously chosen the Kaanapali Beach Hotel for our groups on Maui, which while having an equally ideal location, the Sheraton has more amenities and our passengers have found it to have a more lively, fun atmosphere, both by day and at/after sunset) Its location is perfect. Our passengers were able to enjoy beach walks as well as walks along the boardwalk that connects the hotel to the Whaler's Village shopping complex, where guests can find beachfront restaurants with local bands playing both Hawaiian and mainstream pop music, as well as a collection of shopping opportunities, all less than 5 minutes walk from the Sheraton. Our passengers also raved about the pool area. This year, the Sheraton added one new feature to an already fabulous pool area. The addition of what can best be described as \"waterbound oversized bean bag chairs\" was a big hit among our passengers. The resort provides these free of charge to hotel guests, allowing guests to float leisurely from the main pool through a winding path under palm trees, past small waterfalls etc. The 24 hour outdoor jacuzzi with another mini waterfall was also a nice touch. Another new feature that the Sheraton Maui added this year that was a big hit amongst some of our passengers was the \"Link at Sheraton\". This is their new internet cafe (a feature offered at many Sheratons, but which is especially well designed at the Sheraton Maui, with large picture windows looking out onto the resort grounds facing the ocean, so guests could go online, without feeling like they were in a box , as is often the case with most hotels' \"business centers\". The Link at Sheraton also featured large flat screen TVs and a bar to liven up the experience for those wishing to go online during their stay. Another unique experience at the Sheraton Maui that our passengers loved was the nightly free Cliff Diving show performed at sunset each night. This was a great experience as our group (and really any hotel guests) could gather at the tiki bar for drinks or a bite to eat and enjoy watching a local Hawaiian light a series of tiki torches and then climb a small cliff (called Black Rock), then ceramoniously extinguish his torch and finally, dive into the ocean below. The last thing we really loved about the Sheraton Maui was its access to other nearby activities. Only 5 minutes away was the Kaanapali Zipline office from which we checked in for the popular zipline adventure which our passengers all raved about. A mere 2 minute shuttle ride or a walk on the beach boardwalk took us to other hotels on the same beachfront, where various shows are offered nightly (we took our group to the Hyatt for their Luau one night, via the easy 2 minute free shuttle connecting the hotels on Kaanaplai Beach - FYI, the Hyatt's Luau is in my opinion better than either the Marriott or the Westin Luaus which I have personally seen as well and I would reccommend the Hyatt's luau to anyone staying on Maui.) Another shuttle also connected the hotel to the town of Lahaina, only about 10 minutes away, where our passengers enjoyed a variety of dinner and shopping options (this shuttle operated regularly for only one dollar per person) Other tours picked up right along the beach, so passengers could enjoy a snorkeling tour, a whale watch tour or other tours, with a mere 5 minute walk along the beach boardwalk to the awaiting catamarans for these tours. Overall, I and our passengers have been very pleased with the Sheraton Maui in the 2 years we have taken our allsinglestravel.com groups there and we intend to use this fabulous hotel, ideally located, again and I highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for either a relaxing stay on Maui to simply soak up the hotel's amenities or an action packed stay on Maui with easy access to a wide variety of excursions by both day and night. .", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNoah made our stay....!\u201d", "Author": "viveslesvoyages", "ReviewID": "UR96368082", "Content": "We arrived during whale season and were amazed at the numbers of whales we saw blowing and diving from the check-in area.

The pools, bars and service was excellent. The concierge, in particular, was awesome - he helped us pick great places to eat and visit. Having said that, the 'Road to Hana' guide that was given to us had the wrong Mile Marker for the last few stops (the 7 pools!), which had us making multiple U-turns on the windy highway. Complementary valet on the first day was a nice touch and helped us relax (the parking is a mile away). The hotel wasn't too crowded when we were there ( Jan/Feb) and we didn't have to line up and/or wait for anything. While our room was spacious and clean, the bathroom was very small and the wife felt it was icky. I'd expect a much larger bathroom (and a standing shower) in a resort which is charging >$200/day. We had a great experience at the hotel, but ended up being more expensive than we had planned for, mostly due to the additional per-day resort fees ($26) that were tacked on and lack of reasonably priced dining options. The in-resort dining options were extremely expensive and we had to look elsewhere (whaler's village is nearby - walking distance) for reasonably priced dining options. The hotel bars all closed at 10pm and there's no good bar open late anywhere in walking distance. The gym, which is included in the resort fee., is located 4 buildings across, forcing you to take 2 different elevators to reach it. The parking is the same. This was not convenient at all, especially when we had a baby (and associated luggage) along. They wanted $25/day for a microwave. The resort has a Luau, which is average at best, especially if you have seen others like the one in the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu. The hotel prices the Luau at $99, but you can watch it for $29 for the cocktail only (no dinner) option. We even saw folks watching it for free by sitting on the lawns right outside. The daily Cliff Dive show at sunset is organized by the resort and is free for all to watch. The hotel is on kaanapali beach, right by the Black Rock, which is a gret snorkeling location. This is a great location. Whalers village, where all the good eateries and bars are, is a 5 minute walk away. Our Whale watching boat took off from there as well. The resort has reasonably priced snorkel and cabana rentals on the beach. The Lahaina town is nearby and has great places to eat, although street parking is extremely tough to find. Paid parking is very pricey ($20/2h). Tijuana's, a mexican bar down the street, is sketchy. Don't bother. One thing to watch out for is that the nearest doctor is 90 miles away on the other end of the island. It may be a consideration if you are travelling with kids, etc. Don't dine at any of the hotel's restaurants. The Cliff Dive bar is OK. The others are way too pricey. Just walk over to the Whaler's Village instead for better options. If you can drive, drive over to Lahaina and head over to Cool Cats - they have the best burgers in Maui and friendly service. If you have to watch a Luau and don't want to drive anywhere, watch the in-resort one and ask for the cocktail-only option. There are cocktail-only whale watching tours which are cheaper leaving you to grab dinner elsewhere. Ask the concierge for what you want to do and how much you are looking to pay.

Their cleaning products are designed to kill everything they touch (can't have critters in our guest rooms!), and the residue bowled me over. The housekeeping manager was fairly accomodating (Bobby Shin), Mahalo!, but while the cleaning residue in the \"only other room available\" (??? capacity was 50%!) was better, it was right next to the elevator and the ding-dong of every floor arrival was very audible. I finally aired out my room. \"Mountain-view\" rooms are NOT quiet, the traffic noise from the highway is very noticable. As is the bus/truck traffic from the loading dock/turnaround. No screens on sliding glass door (no surprise), and no just 'fan/vent' option on A/C unit. Luckily the 'low' a/c fan setting is very quiet, but no way to get fresh air w/o other critters. But they've sprayed so heavily few critters are actually left around here. And, they spray OFTEN.

The Sheraton is amazing. We read all reviews, either great reviews or pople who complained. Here is our experience We where on holiday starting January 25th for 7 nights .

We where up graded to the most gorgeous room ,actually a suite overlooking what I call the ocean and pool. We overlooked also the luai show as our suite faced it directly, it was a amazing suite , we loved it. We want to also thank the Sheraton as we had mentioned it was our 25th Anniversary we where celebrating and to our surprise a bottle of champain was brought to us with wine glasses-- just a pleasant added surprise.-- thanks Sheraton ***** The grounds at the Sheraton are amazing, the beach is never to crouded and if you want to rent cabana's or umbrella;s they are always available. We rented a Cabanna and it was awsome , they put it exactly where you want ,the staff are so gracious. The Water is crystal clear and all sandy on the beach in frontof the Sheraton , hardly any rocks in the water which was certainly to my likeing. I certainly enjoyed this as I like to see what is in the water LOL , it is the most beautiful water and so crytal clear. . My husband Loved snorkelling by the black rock as he saw many fish and turtles. It is a awsome beach , not crouded , lots of room ---it is perfect for sun tanning , swimming or snorkeling.. The pool I just loved, lots of room and many private areas which I loved and took full advantage of . I felt like I had certain parts of the pool to myself, It was just just ourstanding. The pool has floating bean bags you can lay on and float though the pools with, just the most comfortable items to use. I almost fell a sleep on one -- LOL there is also a pool just perfect for kids if you have them, I dont but noticed this section, just wonderful. The Buffet breakfast is AMAZING, amost to many chioces, from fruits chioces, to meat chioces, to crepes, bagesl and pasties etc.. OH dont forget about the chef who will make you your own omelet--now how is that for a full breakfast, it is the BEST !!! We had this everyday included and most times there was some differnet items in the buffet , Staff where extermely wonderful in the service of the buffet . Hands down to them all. The Sheraton is a 5 minute walk to the Whalers Village, there is shops to wonder in or food to eat, nice place close to go to . As we walked we checked out all the Hotels, nothing compared, actually some needed reno's such as whalers hotel etc...Westin hotel is nice but to big and wasnt as nice as I had expected when I walked though it, so I am so happy we choose the sheraton over the Westin. The shertaon also has a free shuttle that goes to the Cannery mall and lahiana town, perfect to visit for shopping and great dining areas. nice to have this shuttle , we took advantage of this a few times while we where there. Off course we love bubba Gumps for the shrimps, LOL awsome Check out the pool bar, great nacho's -- and drinks.

However, from my very first impression, this hotel impressed me over and over again. Rachel at the front desk was incredibly friendly and helpful. Our room was upgraded to building 6, which is a bit of a hike, but definitely worth it! There is nothing between you and ocean and for our entire 7 nights we were regaled by turtles and whales swimming right outside our lanai. It was incredible! Fitness Centre: I worked out every day in the fitness centre and never had to wait for a machine. I went both in the mornings and at night. Their machines are good quality. They have a good assortment of weight machines, 4 eliptical trainers, 3 treadmills and 4 stationary bikes. The view is not great, but that would be my one and only minor drawback. They are equipped with flat panel screens, lots of towels and change rooms (which I didn't use, since the fitness centre is very close to building 6).

My husband and I both said it was the best we've ever had. The Crab Cakes were also melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The service was a bit strange, our waiter kept forgetting things and leaving us for long periods of time, but to be fair, he was only \"called in\" and not a regular server there. In the end he seemed nice, but it took him a while to warm up to us. Pool Area: We LOVED this area. You got a \"towel card\" and the towels were nice and big. The chairs all had nice cushions and, best of all, there was never a fight to get a chair! They were plentiful at all times! The area itself was immaculate, they must have amazing \"grounds crew\", we were SO impressed! The pools were well designed. We had a lot of fun following the labyrinth of interconnected pools. Kids would love the set up! Beach: While having breakfast in Kona, we enjoyed a conversation with a local who told us her favorite beach was the one right outside our hotel. Literally miles of beach. It was lovely. It is also well known for it's great snorkeling. We enjoyed viewing many different kinds of fish around the black rock. My husband used the \"Business Centre\", called \"Link\", every morning. He found it sufficient, but there was one really strange thing about it: no phones! He found that a little tough since he connected mostly with a calling card, but everything else was very good. On our last day, we had a late flight. My husband has \"Gold Status\" with Starwood Hotels, and they really did go over and above. They needed the room by the standard check out time as the hotel was nearly full, but we had an early excursion, so we were gone by 6 am. When we returned they had moved all of our things to another room so that they could honor the 4:00 late check out. We felt that this act really summed up our entire experience at this hotel: it was over and above our expectations and we would recommend it highly.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location\u201d", "Author": "Happy2travel18", "ReviewID": "UR94989835", "Content": "Thanks to the prior reviews on Trip Advisor, we had realistic expectations for this resort.

We ate at the Black Rock restaurant night 1 - food was good, service was good. Will agree with a few other reviewers that say the food is expensive at Black Rock - but hey, you are in Hawaii, you almost have to expect a 15% - 20% increase over mainland prices. The torch lighting ceremony was entertaining and I love the live performers for happy hour. Fabulous way to spend your late afternoon, in the pool, floating around and listening to live performances by local artists. Whaler's Village is a short walk away for dinner, sundries and shopping. I bought a beautiful piece of jewelry at Dolphin Galleries and was pleased with the purchase. Leilani's was one of our last dinners and we greatly enjoyed it. Teralani was the company we used for our snorkel/whale watching adventure. Captain Jay and the staff made it a great experience and I felt we received great value for what we spent.

The deluxe ocean front rooms are on top of black rock and we ended up in Building 6. I know alot of the reviews complain about the long walk to the main building but its not bad, maybe 5 minutes? It is a little confusing with the 3 elevator rides but come on, its not rocket science. First off, check-in was quick and easy, everything from the 3rd party site carried over including the Deluxe Ocean Front Upgrade so we were into the room in no time. That particular area has its own parking lot, we never had trouble finding a spot. Room was gorgeous, it was not outdated, and the bathroom was also very nice. The view from our room was -INCREDIBLE-, we saw whales on multiple occasions from our Lanai and even a school of spinner dolphins playing one day. The breakfasts there were good, not great, but far better than any \"Express\" chain or the like. Hot items were plentiful, service was quick from the wait staff, and the buffett changed daily. We never encounted long wait times for seating but we eat early (6:30AM-7AM) right when it opened. Sitting on the outside tables watching the sun slowly light the sky was marvelous. The pool area is nice, its no water park dont get me wrong but its big and has a nice lazy river. Beach access was also very easy to the beautiful Kaanapali beach. In general, the grounds were very well kept. The whole place is very \"open\" and flowing, we were always pleased with the room cleaning and they never once accidentely woke us up or came in while we were in the room. The ONLY complaint I have, and it really peeved me off, was I prepaid for my package and everything except the daily resort fee and incidentals should have been covered. Well imagine my surprise when I get my room bill the night before checkout and its almost a thousand dollars? Then i check my credit card and see they've been trying to ding it for 4 GRAND in charges for the last 2 days (they were declined, thanks God). So I had to go to the front desk the morning of checkout and show the front desk clerk the bill and she said we asked for an upgrade?? I showed her the upgrade to Dlx Ocean was included and she went to make a copy of my paperwork and then they figured out they \"were billing the wrong room\". And no one knew why they had tried to hit my card for 4k in charges so I just let that go. But that could have seriously messed up someones vacation if they had help up alot of funds that were being used for the trip. Another than that small snafu, wonderful property. Oh, note - Sheraton, come on, no wi-fi in the rooms? Its 2011..I can go to almost any other property and have WiFi in the room.

One night they even gave us a coupon for a free dessert at the restaurant we were eating at. The location is great. You are right on the beach, can watch the sunset from any of the west-facing balconies and they apparently have pretty good snorkeling right in front of the beach. (We didn't snorkel, but heard it was good). We did not eat at the restaurants though, they were out of our price range, especially for what you get. There are lots of good little restaurants within walking distance though...(I recommend CJs for breakfast or lunch). Rooms were nice. They definitely were not \"new\" but were kept clean by housekeeping and we had a fridge in our room so we could keep water/beer and some food on hand and the bed was great with plenty of pillows and very comfortable. I'm pregnant and have a hard time sleeping...this bed made it easy. All the rooms I saw had balconies, which was a nice touch also and the hotel is the only hotel I've ever stayed at where they give you body wash instead of just a bar of soap and also leave you a travel size body wash puff. The thing that I didn't like at all was the connectivity to the Internet. They have wired internet in each room, but it was quite slow but they do have a large business center with some computers.

I chose this resort because several travel books said it was a good place for kids. Compared to the other hotels we walked around, the Sheraton is NOT a good place for kids. The so called \"family frieindly \" rooms were nothing but suites, just like any other hotels have. And they are double the price of a standard double room. The pool did have a nice little slide for the kids and a little kiddie pool area. But this was nothing compared to the other hotels we walked past, they were like mini water parks. Other than that, this hotel had nothing else kid geared for kids. This is why I do not understand why it was listed as a good place for kids. The Hyatt and Westin both had fish, birds, waterfalls, etc....everywhere. I would say this hotel is reallly more appropriate for couples....it was very quiet and elegant, and out of the way. Rooms - the condition of the room was great, beautiful, clean, modern, good beds, great TV. I do think the shower/tub area is outdated and needs to be upgraded. It was still acceptable though, just obviously did not \"go\" with the rest of the room. I will say this - we checked in very late, 7 PM, and the only double room they had left was one right by the elevator. He said they were overbooked. and he offered us one of the suites instead for $200 extra per night which he said was a huge discount. since they were usually double the price of our double. He let us look at both rooms and decide. We decided we could not afford the extra money for the suite and the double was wonderful if we could have one not by the elevator (noise, etc....). Well, there was no other double so we got stuck with that one. And I was a bit disappointed he did not give us the suite at no extra charge. Since he hotel was \"overbooked\", I bet it either ended up empty, or some single businessman who checked in late ended up with because they had no more double rooms. The bell on the elevator ended up being a big annoyance......it sounded like our doorbell being rung constantly every AM beginning around 6, then every night around 10. We were on vacation...and wanted to sleep in, but could not. Finally called the front desk on the 2nd night and asked if the bell could be turned off. They said no. My husband asked for a free breakfast or movie to compensate for the inconvenience...they said no. We were paying $400 a night for this hotel and they could not give us a free $13 movie one night? Balcony - we had an oceanview room but because the balcony had a solid concrete wall, then shrubs planted, it was hard to really see the ocean when you were sitting down. I think this is a poor design, other hotels had either clear glass balcony walls, or think poles where you could see though it. It really was not what we were hoping for. The free shuttles to other hotels and Lahaina were great.....but - the Sheraton was way far north. There was noting further North that you'd want to go to. And most of the hotels offer this same free shuttle. I would choose a hotel further south next time. It would be a much closer walk to Whalers Village and you would not even need the shuttle. Black Rock - I also chose this hotel because it was right at Black Rock which was a great snorkeling spot. We were afraid to snorkel. The water was very rough, waves big, and there were big rocks everywhere. It may have been that coming from Hanauma Bay it seemed rough to us. I would not recommend this hotel.

The property is located in front of Kaanapali Bay with Black Rock a short swim away. The beach is public, however it's mostly used by the hotel guests. We went after Thanksgiving and had plenty of room on the sand. Not worth renting the beach chairs, just take your hotel given towels! The hotel is surrounded by great golf courses, with a PGA one in Kapalua only 15 minutes away. The pool area is pristine with a great lazy river that seems to go forever. The pool side bar is great for snacks and it has a daily happy hour at 3:30 - 5:00 and it's a great deal, considering that the food at the hotel can be pricey.

I've stayed in garden-view rooms before and sometime preferred them as they tend to be quieter and have pretty views, but this one overlooked a concrete service breezeway. Because it was ground-floor, it really seemed like a basement apartment and was very dark, even midday. The bathroom was average size but really needed to be freshened up and updated. Nice bathroom amenities though, and the robes were appreciated. The grounds of the resort are beautiful with strolling pathways and lots of plants. The pool is fantastic and probably the best thing about the hotel. I would have thought it was one of the best I'd seen, until we went to the Westin and saw theirs! Some directional signage would be a good idea though since it is sometimes difiicult to get your bearings and find things like bathrooms or the towel kiosk. The beach is wonderful with a great view of Black Rock. We didn't snorkel here as we did a snorkel cruise on the Gemini (very highly recommended). We saw the cliff dive ceremony twice but didn't get pictures either time. The first time my camera battery died just as the diver was climbing to the top and the second time a bunch of kids were hanging out on the top of the rock while the ceremony was happening so the shots were obstructed. The location of the Sheraton is very convenient, both for walking and driving. We used the beach walk path a lot to get to other hotels, restaurants and Whaler's Village, and we also used the shuttle service to go in to the Old Lahaina Luau (so fantastic). The shuttle worked out really well for us although the pickup location at the hotel needs some explanation. We were told by the bellman to go down to the end of the driveway to get it there, but what he didn't tell us was that you have to go into the little circular driveway off to the side into what looks like an abandoned secondary reception desk. Sit on the bench and the shuttle, marked \"Westin\" will come for you. There are multiple pickup spots in Lahaina, none of which are marked either, so a little map would really be handy. As we had a rental car, we parked, first using the complimentary valet service and then once we got situated in our room, started using the self-park at the back of the hotel (by the tennis courts). It was very convenient to our room and we never once had a problem. We only had drinks at the resort, no food, so the only thing I can comment on are the high prices, which we came to accept. There is no booze sold in the gift shop at this resort so if you want bevvies in your room, you'll need to get them off-resort and bring them with you. Something else to note is that as a Sheraton guest, you also have signing privileges at the restauarants at the Westin and Ka'anapali Beach Resort.

The day that we were checking out, my wife was not feeling too well, and asked if I could go get her a cup of hot tea. As it was mid-day, the hotel restaurants were closed. I went to the front-desk and asked if they could help me get a cup of tea. I was first told to go down to the bar, which I did, and the bartender told me they had no hot tea. I went back to the front desk, where concierge said she would call for a food services manager and they would bring one to me. I sat and waited for about 5 minutes, went back to the concierge to ask again, where I was told that she got \"too busy\" and missed the call from food services. She called again and was able to get one of the service manager to the front desk this time, where I was told again that it could be obtained at the bar. I followed the food manager down to the bar, where she asked one of the bartenders there to help her with getting me a cup of tea (as she was fairly new and did not fully know her way around yet), we waited for a couple of minutes while the bartender simply walked around tending to other guests while completely ignoring us. Finally the service manager took it upon herself to look in the back room of the restaurant and was able to get me a cup of hot tea. The entire ordeal from start to finish, to get ONE CUP OF HOT TEA, took close to 30 minutes; all the while my wife was feeling ill. Unfortunately, there is more. I booked my trip through Costco, where one of the perks stated with staying at the Sheraton was a $100 resort credit. Upon check-out, my final payment was $236.66. When I brought up the credit with the front desk, they said okay, and said they would charge me $136.66. Upon my return, I checked my credit card statement, and noticed that in addition to the $136.66, there was another $100 charge on it.

We were blown away by Maui and the Sheraton. I'm an SPG platinum member, but booked our whole trip (airfare, rental, and car) through Orbitz for 7 nights. I contacted the resort ahead of time, and confirmed an upgraded room with points, not to take any chances. Definitely recommend doing that if you want a nice room! When we got there, we were overlooking black-rock on the top floor, with a great room. The other reviews are all correct - when you stay over there, you're a good 5-7 minute walk down to the beach/pool and to the restaurants. However, you feel like you're the only ones on the island and its a perfect spot for honeymooners. We were treated well for being platinum guests though. We had the free breakfast buffet, which was incredible! The pool was nice, crowded at times, and definitely had to play the towel game to get some shade. We rented cabanas at the pool a few times, which were a little costly ($40 if I remember correctly), but worth it. The beach was awesome, and so was the snorkeling. We also drove into Maui quite a few times for dinner, got massages at the spa which was great, and went zip-lining near by! In summary, a perfect honeymoon and I'd love to go back to Maui some time, and would absolutely stay at the Sheraton again.

We both agreed that the Sheraton was an ideal place to stay. As you arrive, enter through the main entrance that says \"Kaanapali Beach Resorts.\" This driveway leads you to several of the resorts, including Sheraton. You will pass a beautiful golf course and The Whaler Village shopping center, on the way to the hotel. When we arrived, valet was very welcoming and offered to answer any questions we had. I was able to check-in slightly early and it only took 5 minutes to check in. I booked an Ocean Front room and was upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean Front room. Room 6408. Building 6, 4th floor, southern most section of the building. Ok, yes, it is far from the main parts of the resort, but the pros out-weigh the cons. Building 6 has it's own private parking lot, so waiting for valet is unnecessary. The building is very isolated, quiet, and private. The deluxe room is 100 square feet larger than the other rooms and also has a convenient microwave. Being on the far south wing of building 6, we had a \"million-dollar view\" of the Pacific Ocean, Black Rock, and Lanai/Molokai. Most of the time, the only thing you could hear was the ocean. So, of course, the disadvantage was the distance to the beach & resort pool/restaurants. From the 4th floor of building 6, we had to take an elevator down to the 3rd floor, cross a breezeway to building 5, take an elevator the 8th floor, cross another breezeway, and take another elevator to the 1st floor. The breezeways are scenic and it's a good workout. Just don't forget something in your room! We had a breakfast buffet included with our package. The ocean/pool views from Keka'a Terrace were so pretty to see in the mornings. There's an omelet station, other warm breakfast items, fruits, pastries, etc. I liked how I could sprinkle chopped macadamia nuts and coconut shavings on my pancakes! Not spectacular, but lots of variety and nourished you until lunch. Vicente was one of our very friendly and attentive servers. The Cliff Dive Bar was a great place to get drinks and appetizers while we were at the pool or beach. $7 cocktail drinks at Happy Hour. Tasty buffalo wings. Their Maui Mojito was one-of-a-kind! Awesome place to hang out (especially to watch the Cliff Dive Ceremony at sunset). On our first time there, Linsey was a great server! The Reef Lounge has Internet computers and a printer. They have a late Happy Hour from 8-10pm. $7 martinis and local beers. There's also a Starbucks kiosk for you coffee junkies. But get there early because I think its only open in the morning. Its on the same floor as the check-in desk. The beach rentals at the resort were very expensive! Blackrock Rentals charged $20/day for a snorkeling set. If you walk 8 minutes down to the Whaler Village, you'll find Maui Dive and Surf Shop (next to Leilani's at the Beach restaurant). Snorkel rentals are $8/day. The resort pool was fairly clean. Water was cold but refreshing if the weather is hot. You have to give \"towel cards\" to be able to check out pool towels. You also need to show proof of being a Sheraton guest at the pool kiosk, so you can get a yellow bracelet to swim in the pool. Get there early or you won't find a chair. Ahhhh! The beach was gorgeous! The sand is very soft, unlike in Waikiki. Blackrock is a great place to go for beginning snorkelers and scuba divers. The water is very calm and the fish are friendly. My husband and I saw many schools of fish. Another snorkeler saw rays! The beach in front of the Sheraton can get crowded because tourists from other parts of Maui also like to go snorkeling/scuba at Blackrock. Contrary to some of the other reviews, our room was cleaned every day, in the afternoon. The cleanliness was decent. I checked for bed-bugs, the moment we stepped in our room. No bed-bugs! However, I saw a cockroach in a breezeway, but what do you expect in a tropical setting?! The Sheraton grounds are so sprawling and are kept so beautiful! Compared to the other resorts, I really liked Sheraton because it never felt crowded (probably because it's so spread out). It's location next to Blackrock make it convenient for snorkeling/scuba-diving. The resort tends to get really quiet after sunset. Very peaceful. Aloha Mixed Plate (in Lahaina, on Front St) serves up some good local food. Leilani's on the Beach at Whalers Village has a delicious Crab & Shrimp Melt and Hula Pie dessert! Try the Seared Ahi Steak w/ caramelized onions and wasabi aioli at Fish Market Maui. The ABC Store at Whalers Village has cheap sundries and souvenirs. My husband and I did the Zipline Eco-Adventure (sign up online or at their kiosk/suite at Whaler Village) and UFO Parasail (sign up at their bright green umbrellas right on the sandy beach in front of Leilani's restaurant). Really great people run the activities! We booked our trip through AAA/Pleasant Holidays. They always give the best package deals for Hawaii! Thanks to my travel agent Eric Lasley at AAA!

Here, we woke up at 8 a.m. got dressed, grabbed some towels and hit the beach before 9 a.m. While later on our trip when we went to Hanamanu Bay in Oahu we had to wake up at 6 to get dressed, pack our stuff, get lunch and snacks, get in the car, drive, park and then carry all our stuff to the beach to get to the beach by 9 am. Huge difference. My vote is for location when traveling with small kids. And, then the pool was nice. I thought it was strange at first since it's more a meandering stream. It just looks visually different then an olympic size pool. But, my son loved it. It was fun roaming the pool. They had a hula dancer one afternoon. Another day they had a lei making class, and that man was soo friendly. Even with all the family activities, I did not see that many little children. The hotel seems to attract lots of early risers, who are out running and walking. We lucked out and got a free upgrade to the ocean view room that overlooked the pool.

The only slight glitch in our entire stay was that we had requested a king bed, but ended up with 2 doubles. Since the hotel was 100% full the first night of our stay, we had to settle for the 2 doubles, but were switched to a king bed room the second day through the remainder of our stay. We booked a \"garden view\" room, but were put in a mountain view - absolutely beautiful views of the mountains and also a partial view of the ocean! The beach outside the hotel is fantastic as well, with great snorkeling. It is also a beautiful walk along the beach if you take the boardwalk either north or south of the hotel. There is close shopping and eating locations in Whalers Village, which is just south of the hotel. Also, if you are looking to take pineapples home - take a short walk to the Westin hotel lobby, located just south of the hotel.

The trip was booked through a travel agent I have used for many years. As we are checking in the young women advises us that we have been given an upgrade however the room has 2 double beds, IS THIS A JOKE we are on our honeymoon, I realize only one of the 1000 other couples your have checked in this year that say that, but come on. After looking at various rooms and 2 hours later, speaking to a manager that could care less, we check into the 'double bed' upgraded room. The next morning the useless manager contacts me, after spending 10 minutes on the phone with me wasting my time they are moving us to building 6. (all a waste as my travel agent contacted them to move us immediately, as I advised them to move me to another hotel.) We booked golf through the concerige 2x that never called us to confirm the tee-times I needed to follow up with them. The food was average, however the breakfast staff were very friendly I felt sorry for them to be at such a proorely managed hotel. We had dinner at the hotel and our server was the friendliest giving us suggested on what golf course to play in Wailea. The Luau is overpriced go to another hotel.

The snorkeling was actually better at the hotel than on the snorkeling tour we took, however, I still recommend taking a snorkeling tour to get out on the water and see some different fish.

Obviously the management has trained their staff well to say to their Platinum members, \"we have a nice upgraded room for you.\" When you reply, did I get my Platinum Suite upgrade the staff member will say, \"I have you already upgraded.\" I have run into this before. The management at this property will do anything they can to increase revenues. I called in a manager and asked her to explain what was happening. She then offered me a suite, but then talked me out of it saying it had no view, first floor, and was just a little larger room with an extra Murphy bed. I requested a suite upgrade in building 5 and then was flatly denied even though on both nights of our stay there were suites in building 5 that were dark (no lights) throughout our stay. These suites have great views but the hotel isn't about to upgrade you as a Platinum unless you're willing to part with additional dollars. SCAM. The hotel itself has a wonderful location, BUT it is old and dated. Really old and really dated. Sheraton constantly advertises the $6 billion + they have spent upgrading their properties, but NOT here. Other than newer carpet and an LG flat screen HD tv, our room was plain and boring. The physcal property is kept up and maintained but has not been updated like other resorts. It's simply old and aging with a terrific location on the beach which allows Sheraton for the time being to sit on their laurels and let guests put up with the quality in return for the location. The pool is the most boring of any major hotel on Kaanapali Beach. The chairs at the pool are in one of the smallest physical areas of any major hotel on Kaanapali beach. The chairs themselves are also of low quality and nothing nice. Towels in the room were of the worst quality we have seen at any hotel this year. I actually grabbed a staff member in the lobby and asked for new towels telling him that what was in the room, threadbare, frayed and thin should have been discarded a long long time ago. Two hours later new towels arrived, but in barely better quality than what we already had. I've never stayed at a Motel 6 or Best Western, but these were of such cheap quality that I would expect to see them in properties that don't even merit a rating. I wonder if other guests have noticed or care. And now for the resort fee, which is the highest on Maui. Yes, even higher than Hyatt Regency and the Ritz Carlton. Having stayed at both properties previously, I would encourage all guests at the Sheraton to visit the Ritz or Hyatt to view their hotels and ask to see their rooms. No comparison whatsover. The art work alone at these hotels (Sheraton has hmmmm...NONE) is phenomenal. So what do you get for your \"resort fee\" of $25? OH MY GOSH, free unlimited telephone calls! You mean I don't have to use my unlimited minutes on my cell phone? I have died and gone to heaven. AND I get to make toll-free calls also without paying a telephone charge. Aren't we all excited??? Now at least at the Westin down the beach you get free water for your resort fee. NOT here. It's only $5 a bottle. Ok, so you also get a free shuttle service if you want to visit one of the other Starwood hotels, BUT do not plan on using their pool, thats strictly a NO-NO. They only want you to visit their other properties on the \"FREE\" shuttle if you want to use their restaurants. Yes, dear guests, it's about revenues. What else do you get? Well the shuttle will drive you into Lahaina if you like. Since we have a rental car like about 99% of the guests on Kaanapali Beach, we don't need to be on a shuttle schedule, we can just get into our car and go. But wait, it's better than an infomercial. You also get internet service!!!! Yippeee, you don't have to use the free computers in the lobby, if you have your computer the internet is free. Now who cares if you're a Platinum member with SPG and the internet service is already included as a benefit of your status. Can you say, \"RIP OFF.\" This is a huge scam in my opinion. There have been class action lawsuits on this charge in the past and I would hope another class action plaintiffs firm takes up the issue. It comes down to revenue. The hotels are struggling in a down economy to keep revenues up. They don't want to raise room charges, which is the fair thing to do, because it might impact occupancy rates, so they stick their guests with a \"resort fee\" that is high enough to increases daily rooms rates the equivalent of 5-10% and the guests don't run. I for one, don't have to put up with this crap. As a Starwood Platinum member my status is obviously not valued by the corporation. I'm not going to pay a resort fee for services I don't always use or services I already receive for free as part of my Platinum status. I would encourage guests who don't need the check-in or nights towards their status to boycott as I am in the future the properties that charge the resort fee. It will be fun to find the best hotels without resort fees and who knows I might just find another frequent stay program I enjoy better in the process! If enough guests balk at the fee it will go away. Furthermore, this particular property isn't that nice. Location is wonderful, but it's at best an ower to average quality experience. For $300 a night that Sheraton claims is a highly discounted rate I'm feeling like I overpaid. I could have just as easily Pricelined this for 1/2 of what I paid and had an equal if not better experience. With the many nights per year I'm in hotels, I don't need the extra check-ins and I'm not going to cater to Starwood ripping me off $25/night, the highest of any resort fee in Hawaii, so that they can jack up their revenues. My realtor just booked a multi night stay at another property through Costco and the normal \"resort\" fee was completely waived, so booking through certain travel providers may also help guests get around the \"resort fee\". Would I recommend this average property as a Platinum SPG who they tried to sell a suite upgrade? NOPE, unless I was paying a lot less per night and no resort fees.

We had been to Maui 3 years ago and stayed at the Westin, where we had a great time. Considering that \"Westin\" is supposed to be a bit of a higher end hotel, we were very surprised to find that we liked the Sheraton even more then the Westin. I am a frequent Tripadvisor user and read many, many reviews and did a lot of research before booking at the Sheraton. This hotel exceeded our expectations and this will probably be our hotel of choice in the future. After arriving at Kahului airport, we picked up our Alamo car rental. We had pre-reserved a convertible there. We were surprised to find that they wanted to charge us extra for having a spouse on the rental agreement. So, we didn't add one of us to the agreement. When we went to select our car, all of the Sebring convertibles were in bad condition. The convertible had many exterior scratches and the inside was horrible- cigarette holes in the carpeting and scraped paint on the dash and doors. It operated fine, but Alamo should replace these vehicles. We then drove to Ka'anapali Beach. This is probably one of the most beautiful 45 minute drives anywhere. We booked at the Sheraton using Priceline and because we were Starwood members, we were given a room upgrade upon check-in even though the hotel was 98% to capacity. We were each given a small shell lei at check-in, which was a nice gesture. Instead of checking in at the front desk, you check in at the bellhop stand. You are required during your stay to visit the front desk to give them a copy of your credit card and if you do not, they will call your room frequently. We were immediately whisked off to our room which was in building 3, which faced the pool and the ocean. The view was amazing. Our room was much, much bigger then our prior room at the Westin. Bedroom furniture was in fine condition as was the bathroom. This is not a 5 star hotel, so do not expect ultra luxury accommodations. But it was clean and well maintained. The lanai (balcony) was also much larger then the one we had at the Westin and to give you an idea of the size- it could have fit about 5-6 chairs on it. The TV was a decent sized LCD. Under the TV was a small fridge that fit our gallon size milk, a full size bottle of apple juice, some beer and wine. So, plenty big. The in-room safe was also a great size and easily fit our laptop (we have a 14\" widescreen laptop, but it would fit bigger). Lots of drawers and cabinet space. The king size mattress was not the most comfortable for me but my husband had no complaints. We did not have any meals included in our room rate and we knew from our prior trip that the best idea is to stop off at the Safeway supermarket in Lahaina on the way to the hotel for breakfast foods, drinks and snacks. This saves money and is convenient. We picked up a gallon milk (approx $5), cereal (Multi Grain Cheerios were $5 but Cinnamon Life was $8- food and groceries are very expensive in Hawaii because everything is imported), juice, soda, water, beer, wine, etc. We also got smart mid-way through the trip and bought pre-made sandwiches at Safeway and put them in our fridge. (Huge ones to feed 3-4 people cost $9). This was great for lunch. We ate breakfast everyday on our lanai looking out at the ocean. Once for lunch we were lazy and ordered from the pool bar. Burgers and sandwiches were $14-18- pricey. I had the pulled pork sandwich which was very good. My husband had the flatbread pizza (which was an appetizer for $9) which he said was ok and was plenty big. We went to the gym at the hotel a few times. It is small but well equipped- a few bicycles, treadmills and ellipticals. There was some free weights and some weight training equipment. It is a bit confusing to find. TIP: Even if you don't want to go to the gym, walk there one day. There are some beautiful views along the way. The pool: beyond fantastic. Sadly, the hotel does a very poor job of photographing such an amazing pool. I thought it was only going to be one round area\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Instead it is fairly large with lots of waterfalls, narrow lagoons, a deep section, a children's area, and even a slide (which both adults and kids loved). Contrary to other reviews, pool chairs were always available at any time of day. BUT if you want a chair in the shade, you will need to get to the pool by 10ish to reserve a chair in the shade. Even though the resort was 98% full when we were there, the pool was never crowded and we enjoyed the pool immensely. There is one hot tub towards the middle of the pool area- it is a bit hidden and we didn't find it until our last day. The hotel gives out wristbands to use the pool each day (you get them while you are sitting by the pool). This ensures that only Sheraton guests can use the pool. They verify both room number and last name to get a wristband. When you check into the hotel you get towel cards which you exchange by the pool for towels. You must turn these cards back in when you checkout. The beach: soft sand, very light ocean current. Fantastic snorkelling at Black Rock. You only have to snorkel out a few feet to see fish. Although if you are a good enough swimming to swim out to black rock point, you'll see even more fish. Water was a tad cool, but still comfortable. Water was crystal blue. Excellent visibility. The hotel does not give you beach chairs, so we left all of our gear on chairs by the pool and went to use the beach. Bring your own snorkel equipment if you can (or buy some at the Costco or Kmart by the airport before coming to the hotel), or rent in Lahaina. It is much more money to rent snorkel equipment at the Sheraton. If you want a beach chair, you have to pay for it. So, instead we would leave our items on chairs near the pool and go to use the beach. Always leave any items of value in your hotel room safe. Hotel grounds and miscellaneous: Again, even though the hotel was so full, we never noticed. The hotel sits on a very large piece of property so no one feels crowded. The grounds are well maintained with lush foliage. Staff was very friendly. The hotel gives each room 45 minutes of free internet access in the business area located on the lower level below the lobby- you can use this to print your boarding pass if the computer by the lobby isn't working. There is also internet access in all rooms but you need to use the room's network cable (no wireless internet). There is a $25 resort fee per day. This is mandatory and includes 1 valet parking, unlimited self-parking, in room internet access, and use of the gym. The parking lot on the left when you enter the grounds is only designed for compact cars, which makes parking rather difficult if you are in a convertible (which we were). We found parking much easier on the roof level. We were then informed towards the end of our trip that there is another small outdoor lot by the tennis courts by Building 3 that we could use. It was much more convenient but smaller. We didn't use the tennis courts, but there were 3 and they seems new and very nice. Hotel layout: While the grounds are beautiful, the buildings were clearly not built at the same time. This led to a very disjointed feel when moving from building to building. Often times you have to go up and down levels as you move through buildings since not every level had access to the adjacent building. For instance, we were on building 3, level 2. We had to go up to level 3 to cross to one building, then up to 8 to another and then down to 7 where the gym was. This was a little confusing at times, but most of the breezeways are outdoors with some nice scenery. Check out: check out was just as easy at check in. We had a late flight and were able to use the shower in the fitness facility after we checked out before our flight. On our prior trip we did the molokini/turtle town snorkel (great), Old Lahaina Luau (great), bus up to Haleakala (rained so we couldn't see sunrise) and the drive to Hana. So, this time we did a bunch of activities on our own- one day we drove to Kahului, then to Iao State Park to see the Iao Needle, then down to Wailea. In Kahului we ate at Da Kitchen- they serve the famous mixed plate lunches (mixed plate- you get your entr\u00c3\u00a9e with a scoop of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad). I will post a review. Iao State Park was nice and did not take up too much time. Gorgeous views up in the mountains. We then drove down to Wailea to see what the resort area was like down there. We parked at Polo Beach and used the public beach in front of the Fairmont. We agreed that we liked Ka'anapali beach much better. Maui Swap Meet: Every Saturday there is a small flea market at the Maui Community Center in Kahului. You pay .50 per person to enter. There are produce stands, crafts, t-shirts, etc. The produce stands are great- make sure to buy and try some local produce including apple-bananas (baby bananas that taste sweet like apples), great mangoes, and other assorted unusual fruit. The swap meet on Oahu is much bigger and better but if you are only staying on Maui, go here for t-shirts and souvenirs. We ate lunch and dinner at a variety of places: Leilani's on the Beach, Pacific-O, Da-Kitchen, Lahaina Pizza Company, Moose McGillicuddy's. I will post separate reviews for these places. Shopping: We went three nights to Lahaina. You can take the Sheraton's free hotel shuttle or drive. We drove and had no issues finding parking. You can get free parking on the main strip in Lahaina or pay $6 to park in a lot. Lots of silver and gold jewelry shops, souvenirs, t-shirts, art, etc. We found this to be the best place on Maui to buy gold jewelry (you can haggle). Tons of restaurants here. Tips: -If you plan on eating breakfast in your room, pack some disposable bowls and utensils to save money on buying them in Hawaii. You could even consider packing a box of cereal. -Use Tripadvisor to find less expensive restaurant alternatives -Definitely eat at some restaurants that are mostly used by locals- you'll get better value and get to experience some great island cuisine -Try new foods- Mixed Plate, Fresh Fish, Shave Ice, etc. -Try to avoid buying food at the hotel to save money. -Bring inflatable rafts/toys (rings, balls etc) from home and blow them up on the beach to save money. This is great fun for kids and adults. -Buy your own snorkel set (mask and snorkel) before coming to Hawaii or buy one at the Walmart or Costco or Kmart in Kahului before you go to your hotel. You can buy a set for $10-$20. You can rent them in Hawaii, but it costs the same, if not more and its always best to have your own set.

We spent 6 days, 5 nights at the hotel. Our package included a daily breakfast buffet and the steep $25 resort fee which included things like parking, WiFi, and free local calls (within Maui). Check-in was a breeze - no credit card needed. Just show an ID, and get your room key. (If you make room charges later, they'll ask for a credit card on file.) We started off on the wrong foot when the power went out in the entire resort, just 20 minutes after we got there. All we wanted to do was shower & sleep after a long flight, which was nearly impossible in the pitch black. Wish they had given us some notification of what was going on, but they did not. We saw employees placing glowsticks down the hallways to give a little bit of light. Thankfully the power returned after about 90 minutes and we were able to get our act together. We still have no idea what happened or why they thought glowsticks would help, BUT everything was great after that! Breakfast buffet was excellent, with a ton of choices: fresh fruit, homemade baked goods, choose your own omelet station, bagels & lox, a rotating selection of french toast, pancakes, etc. And the bacon was hands-down, some of the best bacon I've ever had in a restaurant. Not to mention that the setting for breakfast, looking out onto the manicured gardens, the pool, and the ocean, was just superb. The hotel grounds are beautiful, but the best part is the pristine beach it fronts. Kaanapali Beach, just steps from our hotel room, was one of the nicest beaches we've ever been on. It takes the cake for swimming and snorkeling with its warm, clear, and calm water. We saw all sorts of fish, sea turtles, and coral just by swimming a few feet out. The beach was a nice, safe place for children of all ages. The only downside is that everyone knows about this place, so it can get crowded. As a backup, you can explore the beautiful pools at the hotel, which are almost as enjoyable. The Sheraton is also convenient to the town of Lahaina, with a shuttle bus that takes you directly from the hotel into town. There are great shops, restaurants, a museum, and the nice Banyan Tree Park in Lahaina. The hotel has activities such as yoga, pilates, hula dancing class (more for the little ones), intro to scuba, intro to snorkeling, etc. Some require an extra fee. It also hosts a luau which we did not attend, but caught glimpses of from our room. It did not seem as nice as the one we attended, the Old Lahaina Luau. Overall, the hotel excels because of its location on the beach, close to town and convenient to the highway to travel around the rest of Maui. The grounds are well-kept and the pools and beaches make it a must-see.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Villages, Florida", "Title": "\u201cThank you Sheraton Maui\u201d", "Author": "Oldsurfer250", "ReviewID": "UR84842504", "Content": "My wife and I bought a 3 night stay at the Sheraton Maui at a silent auction for the Friends of Missing Children Hawaii.

We walked around other hotel grounds in the area and really felt that the Sheraton was by far the nicest. The rooms were tastefully furnished and very clean. The garden view was very pretty and we were glad we didn't pay for an ocean view room. We really didn't spend that much time in our room to justify the upgrade cost. In addition, there are so many places in Maui to take in an amazing view it seems silly to pay for it. The service was courteous and efficient, we had a key issue and an A/C issue during our stay and both issues were resolved in less than 10 minutes after we notified them. Overall, a wonderful stay and we wouldn't stay anywhere else if we return to Maui.

I think I will buy myself one to take with me on future holidays. We went to the beach bar just about everynight to see the cliff dive. The sunsets were stunning and obviously different everyday. The beach bar serves snack foods and there are a couple of restaurants and an indoor bar for when the beach bar closes (8pm). There is a path along the beach to the whalers village. This is not what we expected, very loud and commercialised. We had a couple of meals here. Was ok for shopping during the day tho. There is also a free shuttle bus to the local town, Lahaina.

I must say that I read all the reviews as I always do which plays a part in deciding where we will stay. Throughout the whole trip I kept asking my family, \"How could anyone complain about this hotel?\". Sure nothing in life is completely perfect, but this hotel comes close. When we checked in I asked to be upgraded to an ocean view from our reservation of garden view. They said it depended on availability and sure enough we were upgraded. I do agree that the view makes a difference, but there was no guarantee we would get it. My advice is to pay for what you want just in case you don't get upgraded. You should not be upset if you don't get upgraded as that is not what you booked. It was icing on the cake to be upgraded. Next time I wouldn't risk it or count on it and just pay outright for the upgrade, just in case. Sure no one likes to pay a resort fee, but any nice hotel charges for these. Get over it! Yes the food can be expensive, but again, that is expected. You are staying at a luxury resort, on vacation. Plan on paying for these extras and don't be disappointed. There are no hidden fees, it is just the way it is. If you don't like it, stay elsewhere. I don't think the resort is too spread out as some have said. I can't really complain about anything. We have stayed at the Westin and the Kaanapali Alii so we are use to nice resorts. I must say that this is one of the nicest and I definitely plan on going back. The beach is great, the snorkeling great, the pool very tropical and not ordinary. The rooms are spacious (for a hotel, and non-condo) and there is a refrigerator which you don't often find at hotels. To save money you can buy some sandwhiches or the like for a meal or two. In reading the last review, who cares what the parking garage is like?! That's not your room. I just don't understand some of these complaints and believe me, I can be very picky. We had a small problem with our room (plumbing issue) but Laura DeMott was very receptive. Sure some staff are friendlier than others but again, if someone is not over the top nice, is that going to ruin your trip?! In sum, all I can say is I am counting the days (and I've only been home 2 days) until we can go back. I absolutely love the Sheraton Maui and I can't possibly see why anyone would not feel the same way.

There is also a Costco & K-Mart in the airport area. After a pit stop in Paia for fish tacos (as seen on \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"), we arrived at the resort just before sunset. The 1st day of valet parking is included in the $25/day+tax resort fee. If you don't get the car & self park after that, it's $5/day. You can pick up your room key right at valet parking, along with a shell lei greeting. We, however, requested a king bed and were given 2 fulls, so we headed to the front desk to see if we could make a change. The young lady there (I think her name was Jenny or Lindsey) was wonderful. The hotel was at 95% occupancy but she was able to switch us to a king room after 1 night. Off we went to room 3428 for 1 night. Now, the resort is really spread out-we were in bldg 3, 4th floor, room 28 which looked directly across the lawn to the ocean and Lanai. Spectacular!! The room itself was great, nice bathroom, the usual mirrored sliding door closet, flat panel tv & a large dresser which housed the mini-fridge plus drawers for clothes. The balcony was roomy enough for a small table & 2 chairs. Except for the 2 full beds, it was perfect. Day 2 we switched to room 4202 (bldg 4, 2nd floor, rm 2). This room is on the corner of bldg 4, directly over the spa, so it was angled a little. The view was partly towards the resort, and partly down the Kaanapali coast-still a lovely view with a roomy balcony. All the same room amenities but the smaller closet was inside the bathroom, which was sometimes inconvenient for 2 people. In either room, we never heard any other guests except when sitting on the balcony. Both rooms were nicely maintained. We met a couple who snagged Sheraton Preferred Guest status and were given a room in bldg 5 which looked out over the ocean to Molokai. It was a little trickier to get to, but they said the view was worth it. Speaking of tricky to get to, the fitness center had all the basics once you found it (down the hall of bldg 4, up the elevator to the 8th floor, down the hall in bldg 6, to the elevator & then down to the 7th floor.) The wonderful discovery along the way was the rotunda on the 8th floor. Beautiful views, especially of the cliff diver at sunset. It is also the location of yoga & pilates classes some mornings ($10 fee). The breakfast buffet ($27 pp if not included in your package) had a nice variety, but nothing to really rave about. Everything we tried was good, not great, but good. We ate dinner in the Black Rock restaurant (expensive but good), the Reef Lounge (less expensive, more casual & also good); snacks at both the Mai Tai & Cliff Diver Bars poolside (recommend the chicken skewers). Longboard Ale $7 per plastic cup or Coors Light $5; other beers in a can plus all the tropical drinks with umbrellas $10+. We enjoyed the pool, which everyone agreed was on the chilly side of refreshing. It is generally around 4-5\" deep, with shallower & deeper ends (for kids & scuba school). There's also a \"lazy river\" which meanders nicely around from one end to the other, a welcome change from the standard rectangular pool. We took the shuttle (included in the mandatory resort fee) into Lahaina, which stopped at the Cannery Mall, Hilo Hatties & Lahaina Center (across the street from the Cannery Mall). There are grocery stores at the 1st & last stops and Front St. is just a stroll from Hilo Hatties. The resort had Hawaiian cultural activities daily (around 11-12 noon) , poolside near the Cliff Dive bar, such as lei making & hula lessons. We took a \"behind-the scenes\" tour with executive chef Brian who taught us how to make quick crab wontons & decorative pineapple carving. Thanks, Chef!! Whalers Village is a short stroll down the beachside sidewalk for more eating & shopping choices. The Westin is just beyond that. As for the mandatory resort fee, which seems to be a growing trend in the industry, just include it in the room rate when comparing different resorts. We have no complaints, much to compliment and can't wait to return.

I inquired about the ocean view upgrade, and was told it will be $150 extra per day for Bldg 6. We declined, and settled on the 3rd floor in Bldg 3 facing the mountains and golf course. The view was very nice, but of course, I was jealous of those who got the ocean upgrade. I really wonder how some can get the ocean upgrade for free. Room service was good, up until the last day. They came in at 930am, and we said we were not ready. We put the card out, and from 2 to 6pm, we went to the beach. They never came to clean the room. When I called front desk, they immediately sent someone up to give us new towels...so that was ok. The sitting area of Bldg 5 is amazing. I recommend everyone go there and sit and enjoy the view there. The parking structure near Bldg 1 and 2 is gross and old. We parked there the first night, and that location made my husband very disappointed. Dank and old. The 2nd day, we explored the better areas of the hotel, and he was much happier. The pool is very nice. Not your regular rectangle pool, but a meandering one with a little slide. My parents loved it. I loved the fake waterfalls, and we took pics that made it look like I was at the real waterfall. Black Rock is great for snorkeling. We saw giant turtles!!! My husband jumped off the Black Rock.

The pool bar is so much fun, we felt like we were in paradise. The best part for us was the beach in front right on Black Rock. We brought our own snorkel gear and as soon as you step in the water, you feel as if you've stepped into a tropical aquarium. We saw tons of fish and farther out one day was a group of 4 stingrays that swam right under us! The next day we swam with giant sea turtles for hours right on the shore!

The water is crystal clear, calm, safe, and warm enough to hop in in October, but the much touted Blackrock has little/no live coral and a few schools of the same fish, much like the rest of the onshore accessible snorkeling spots that we scouted around the island. My husband did see 3 sea turtles while paddle boarding ($30/hr to rent the board) and some other guests mentioned that they saw some eagle rays from the shore around dusk. Know in advance that you will be doing some walking. To get from building 6 to the lobby/where breakfast is, it takes 3 separate elevators and several breezeways to walk to and from. We workout daily, but this could be a problem for elderly folks. The grounds and pools are very nice and beautifully manicured - there is a section for kids so you can avoid that if you don't have any in tow. There is even a tiny in-pool water slide (maybe 2-3 foot drop) to entertain the little kiddies.

Access was included with the $25/day resort fee (which also included gym and parking). We booked a package which included breakfast vouchers, which you can use as the Sheraton, Westin (next door), and another Westin down the street. There is a complimentary shuttle that will take you between the resorts and to Lahaina on an hourly basis. We ate at both the Sheraton and the Westin next door and the Sheraton breakfast was the clear winner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was way better, but with a garden view. The Westin next door won the ambience award for breakfast as we ate facing the ocean. We ate at the BlackRock Restaurant for their post 8pm BOGO dinner. The service was really slow, no bread plates, the server forgot to ask for our drink order until after our dinner was served, and the food was average (mine was really salty). Since it was a BOGO deal, I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain, but if we were paying full price, I would have talked to a manager.

We were upgraded to ocean view in building four which is the best building to be in. We found checkin to be seemless ,very friendly and the bellmen were the definition of Aloha. First night free valet is a must for this resort and im glad to see this is their policy. Rooms: The rooms are small and very basic. But they do well. the beds are very comfortable. We needed more pillows and were quickly accommodated. We had an amazing view of the beach and of black rock from our balcony. In fact there were 3 weddings done right below our balcony. The rooms fit our needs well. Only minor complaint is the tv service. literally takes 5 seconds to flip from one channel to the next ..but in hawaii we dont watch much TV:) Food. :We had good experience on the whole. We never did the breakfast buffet as it was a zoo everymorning just to get in, not our idea of relaxing vacation. Very glad we booked it without the breakfast option. We had a fridge in our room and had yogurt fruit and granola for breakfast. cereal some days. picked this up at safeway in lahina and worked well for us. had a few breakfasts down at hula grill in whalers. A must do!! We had a great dinner in the steak restaurant and the teryaki skirt steak was one of the best I have ever had. Service was outstanding this night. They also have a starbucks coffee cart that was very convenient for some coffee and quick snacks. Our biggest negative was the dinner under the stars program. We booked this very expensive dinner ahead of time and picked our menu. we sat in a quiet place along the beach. The food was lacking and the service was really bad. We were left at one time between courses for 45 minutes. We were very disappointed. HOWEVER the management responded promptly to this complaint and took care of our unhappiness. They were professional and genuinley wanted to remedy this night for us. We left very satisfied. This should not keep anyone from experiencing this resort. problems do occur and its all about how management handles them. This resort is managed very well and they will go out of their way to make it right. Pools: One pool setup as a wandering river with some large areas. pool service was good. and food from the pool bars was very good. drinks are expensive. but then all food and drink in hawaii is:) they will go around and give you wrist bands. who wants a wrist band tan line. we just attached them to our suits. This is annoying but we understand why they do it. with the best location on kaanapaili you will have pool crashers. We never had a problem finding chairs. although sometimes ones with shade were all taken.Pool is gorgeous and fun. no a huge one like the westin or hyatt but it serves the resort well. general resort. Parking is an issue at this resort if you comeback late. I hope they address this. they need another garage closer to the resort or offer valet free with the resort charge. A little bone of contention. the resort fee included the resort shuttle. however because of the maui marathon they did not run the shuttle for some days. So where was the partial credit? The resort is pretty, but not stunnning. No animals and no fish even in the ponds they have. I can see how some would find it boring but we did not. The resort catered to all ages well. there is no nightlife but we were not looking for that at this resort. There was live music at the pool bar in the evenings which was nice. we did not attend the luau because we did the old lahina luau. This is a big resort to walk around but some of the complaints about how far you have to walk are strange to me. i like a resort that is spread out like this. It never felt crowded even when full. I would rather have that than the craziness of the westin. kids. did not bring ours this trip but would have no hesitation about bringing them here. Seems like kids would have a great time. beach.. the best on kannapali. please note that snorkeling here is hit or miss. Somedays its cloudy. some days when the riptide is rolling this can be a very dangerous place to be. saw 4 rescues and trips to the hospital while there. I even got to play life guard and rssue a a man that was only 30 ft from shore but couldnt make it. I grew up in the ocean in santa cruz and those who are not familiar with the ocean should really ask or slowly check it out themselves. That being said the clear calm days here are amazing. I had 7 turtles around me at one time. saw a spotted ray and many fish especially out around the corner. the turtles are very close to shore so in the breakwater dont step on them:) closing. know that everything in hawaii is expensive. We had a great time but we can see why hawaii tourism is suffering. We will go back but we spend a lot of time in the Caribbean and we love it there more. Even in mexico, riviera maya, we find the service and hotels to be of a higher caliber with about a quarter of the cost. Only thing hawaii offers us better is the beautiful mountains and better weather. I would love to see a renaissance of hawaii and see the resorts a little more competitive on price points. You do have amazing restaurants in hawaii as well. Merrimans is a dont miss. The mountains and waterfalls and hiking are the clincher for hawaii. nowhere will you find this better. the hike to waimoku falls out of the 7 pools is a must.

Most of the rooms are set back a good distance from the beach, so you don't feel like you're right there on water, Then again, I'm comparing this to our stay at Turtle Bay, where I would re-visit in a heartbeat. The food at the Sheraton was also nothing to write home about--not bad (except for our dinner at the Japanese restaurant on premises), but not memorable either. The breakfast buffet did not have much variety from day to day, and the birds were everywhere in the morning. After a while we grew accustomed to them, but I can't help but wonder how healthy it is. For dining, there are many and better places to eat at the Village nearby. I will say that the staff were always very friendly and helpful. There's a very good concierge service, and as long as you don't go to the restaurants expecting the staff to treat you like royalty (which some guests seem to think), you'll always find smiles and friendly service.

After enjoying the sun and a tasty beverage at the bar we went to check into our rooms.

The valet parking is fairly affordable ($5/day at the time we were there) however, it is just as easy to self park for free. The reason that this hotel is so great is purely the location. Situated on Black Rock the snorkeling is top notch! We were within three feet of two large sea turtles and saw a plethora of fish of all colors! The nightly cliff diver at the hotel is not to be missed! The grounds are well maintained and offer close proximity to the Whalers Village Shopping Center. They have plenty of activities going on at the hotel (most you have to pay for) including yoga in the mornings. The swimming pool is a lagoon-style shape which wraps around the grounds converging in a larger main pool. The pool was hardly ever crowded and often times quite cold.

Big awesome turtles right there at Black Rock and Ka'anapali now ranks as my favorite beach. It was nice to not have to drive anywhere and just stroll out to it. Location, location, location. Whalers Village is a short easy walk from the Sheraton as is Kahekili Beach. They put this resort in just the right place.

Sunsets were romantic. Everything about the view from our room was excellent!! The location of the room was perfect for our wedding/honeymoon. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a distance from the main areas of the resort but it was worth the walk or drive just for the view and the privacy. We really appreciated our wedding manger Michelle Chang for all her help in planning our wedding. We had an intimate ceremony for two on the Black Rock Lawn. It is a lovely location I think it might be one of the best spot on the grounds to have a wedding. Following our ceremony, we enjoyed a very romantic Dinner under the Stars. We received great gifts & little unexpected extra treats for our honeymoon night and our stay in general, thanks in part to Michelle. All the arrangements made for our special day will give us a lifetime of great memories. Overall we thought the other staff members were very friendly. We enjoyed the service at the Mai Tai Bar and all the bellmen and cleaning staff were very helpful. The beach is great. Have to do the breakfast buffet every day.

Soft sand and calm waves, made this beach one of the nicer hotel beaches we saw 2. Convenient location. It is close drive to the popular Front Street for dinner/shopping/drinks and walking distance to local hotels and shopping centers. They also have a free shuttle to Front Street. 3.

Your $25 dollar a day resort fee includes self parking (valet is extra), however when you get home in the evening after dinner there were never any parking spots.

It was annoying to have to remember to bring the towel cards and to turn them in by 6pm or else you have to hold onto the towel until the next day because the towel booth closed down - There are no beach chairs or pool float rentals included. Why isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that part of the resort fee? 4. Almost nightly our key cards stopped working and we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get into our room or parking lot. We had to go to the front desk to get our key cards changed 4 out of 5 nights we were there. 5. Confusing layout.

I called Starwood MANY, MANY, MANY times and was quoted a wide variety of rates. Do your research to make sure you get yourself the best rate. The grounds are really beautiful and very well kept. The pool was nice and never overly crowded. If you wanted an umbrella/palapa I would suggest getting to the pool a bit on the early side. The location was near both the snorkeling at Black Rock and the restaurants/shopping/entertainment at Whalers Village. The Starwood properties (Westin/Sheraton) offer a complimentary shuttle btwn hotels and stops in Lahaina which is really a nice service to have. I was far from wowed by any of the service here - and I am not picky! We checked in after the late flight in on Delta and our room had already been assigned to us, so there was not really a discussion regarding upgrades/views/etc. I have both AAA and Starwood, so I am always hopeful they may throw ya a bone. I got exactly what I had paid for - garden view. In the end we were happy w/our location because its a big place and we wanted to be near the pool. The \"kids\" working the valet/bellman were goofing around at arrival. The entire crew we met at arrival was a little goofy. I was expecting more from the room. Things were worn(especially the shower curtain and shower head) and the housekeeping was very average (but this is a four star resort). They need those signs you hang on your door when you are all set and ready for them to clean. Housekeeping walked in twice when I was on the phone with the airlines. The beds/linens/pillows were all very good, and the place was quiet through out the night. We loved having the fridge in the room. I would have to say the housekeeping staff was the friendliest of them all - always giving an \"aloha\" as we would pass. Oh... the lovely resort fee. You will hear many people complaining about this around the pool/restaurants/etc. Its really a joke, just like baggage fees in the airlines they have found a way to make a few extra bucks. Those few extra bucks can really take a toll overall on a vacation. The \"free\" internet is not wireless and has to be used at a table with squeaky wicker chairs in the corner of the guest rooms. The resort fee does NOT cover getting to use a beach chair down on the sand/beach. Its does begin to feel like nickle and dimeing after awhile. We rented one chair for one day and the service at the rental cabana was horrible. We were next in line to rent after standing in line for sometime when they decided to start serving people out of another window. When I pointed out that we had been waiting and were now being \"budged\" by five more families it was \"sorry\" with a shrug. When asked for the return procedures at the end of the day I got another snotty remark about making sure I leave them a few dollars under my chair for hauling it away. They give out wristbands daily by the pool which I liked. It was very well enforced. We got to know some of the staff passing out the wristbands and they were very friendly. The pool area was more relaxing and not wild with kids which was plus. There were lots of kids there, with a great pool, but it never got loud and wild, especially compared to some of the other mega pools down the way. They also check room cards when people are trying to use the shuttle which I also thought was great. It really was a little piece of paradise.

Apparently, the hotel was sold out while we were there, but we never got that sense, except with respect to the pool area, which does fill up by mid-morning. We were upgraded to an ocean-front room, which was very nice, though others have pointed out that the rooms face the ocean, but are pretty far away from it (past hotel grounds and pool area). Gym was small, but never over-crowded when we were there. There are no stores on the hotel grounds, except for a convenience store, which is rather unusual for a Hawaii hotel but no problem with us. The location beach-wise is wonderful - we snorkeled one day and it was amazing, high point being a turtle swimming by about 2 feet from us (turtle was followed by 80 other snorkelers!).

The staff we encountered in the lobby, and at all the pool and beach restaurants and kiosks (towels, snorkeling rental, etc.) were not from Hawaii and none too friendly or helpful - little aloha spirit there. To get that, we ate dinner next door at the Kaanapali Beach hotel, where the staff seemed like they were all from Maui, and there was a local menu and live Hawaiian music every night.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, but don't eat there!\u201d", "Author": "War-chique", "ReviewID": "UR75859217", "Content": "I am not going to tell you about the hotel. It is a good hotel in a very good place with wonderful beaches, excellent snorkeling, etc. There is enough reviews of that kind here. What I would like to share is a pretty strange and sometimes unpleasant experience we've got at two restaurants located on the property: \"Black Rock Steak and Seafood\" and \"Teppan-Yaki Dan\". Both are extremely slow in service, fish/seafood dishes are far from being decent for an island in the middle of Pacific Ocean, steaks are relatively good for a small island, but far below average in the US. Price-wise, both eateries are pretty weird: an average bill for dinner for two (appetizer, main course, two glasses of mediocre wine and two cups of tea) can easily reach $150-200. If you try to share your dish, they have $20 Split Plate Charge for you! Dan is a sorrowful parody on both authentic Japanese teppanyaki and Benihana. Breakfast is served at Black Rock Steak and Seafood which changes it name for morning food function on \"Keka'a Terrace\". Don't allow this little trick to fool you. It's the same place: slow and overpriced. With the tip you will pay $25 for 'Continental' or $35 for a breakfast with an egg. This is for the buffet. A la carte will cost you the same but you will spend your entire morning in dining room instead of enjoying the beach. Simply, these guys consider you trapped on their property and have no choice rather than to be a victim of their restaurants. The nearby Whalers Village provides you with the same kind of hospitality: 40 min wait for a burger. Recommendations: go to Farmers Market at 3636 Lower Honoapiilani Road, Lahaina, and buy fresh fruits, juices, and diary, and make your breakfast and lunch yourself. For dinner - drive to downtown Lahaina (5 min from the hotel) and find the dining place you like (from Ruth's Chris Steak House to Italian to Chinese, to whatever).", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aliso Viejo, California", "Title": "\u201cUnforgettable!\u201d", "Author": "tonahahu05", "ReviewID": "UR75831959", "Content": "The Sheraton Maui Hotel was spectacular! Our stay there was unforgettable! It was our first time ever in Maui. My husband and I stayed there with our 2 kids. Initially we were supposed to go in June 2010 and we reserved our trip 9 months in advance. However, our 4 year old son was hospitalized for 2 weeks the day before we were to leave. Our first trip included an Ocean Front room. After my son left the hospital and recovered we rebooked the trip for the beginning of August and all we were able to afford was a Garden View Room in the back. As my son had to have minimal exposure to the sun, we were disappointed. We wanted him to have a great view of the ocean and sunsets as I knew I would be spending a lot of time in the room with him. I shared my story about my Son with the front desk manager and she upgraded us to an Ocean Front room! All I can say is WOW! The room was phenomenal and had a direct view of black rock. Luckily we were able to very easily find lounge chairs with umbrellas by the pool which worked out perfectly for my son. The snorkeling around black rock was amazing! We saw lots of turtles. The beach in front of the Sheraton never got overly crowded so it was perfect. Our room was clean, looked new, spacious enough for all 4 of us and the beds were super comfy!! It was really nice too because we had a refrigerator in our room. The staff was incredibly gracious and accommodating. Even after our 4th day there, one of the staff we had seen from the first day said hello and remembered our names!

We went to the luau as a group and for some reason, the Sheraton concierge tried to charge us for the whole group - it is not like we were the organizers or made bookings on the group's behalf or anything.

This was our first trip to Hawaii and we fell in love with the island of Maui. We were traveling with our 10 year old son. The Sheraton is 45 minutes west of the airport and we checked in at 10 pm. Check in was easy as we were the only people there. Our travel agent got us the free breakfast buffet deal, which we received on check in . Our room was an ocean view, which had 2 double beds and a beautiful view of the ocean and beach in building #2. My husband was bummed about the double bed but the mattresses were extremely comfortable. The Sheraton had recently changed their kids program which was now the Starwood Preferred Guest program. For $15 a day you got a wristband which entitled your child to a free buffet breakfast, free pop and lunch at the Mai Tai or Clff Dive bars, and free supper at the Steakhouse. As we got two breakfast coupons per day for our stay and the buffet cost $15 for a child it was a no-brainer to go for this as it basically gave us a free lunch for our son. We spent our time divided between the pool area and the beach. The pool was a great temperature and had a kids area and a regular area. We hung out by the Mai Tai bar which only opened 11-3 and served drinks and lunch. The prices were high but you were getting pool side service. I recommend ordering the Pineapple Royale which is not on the menu but is a hollowed out pineapple filled with the drink of your choice (mine being the drunken monkey). The beach is beautiful but the surf is much stronger than the east coast of Mexico. In our first hour on the beach my son and husband lost their sunglasses never to be seen again and I twisted my knee when I was knocked over by a wave. My husband snorkeled by the famous black cliffs and saw an octopus, sea turtles, and many colorful fish. I was told by other snorkelers that the action by this hotel was as good as the tours one could purchase. If you want to you can rent umbrellas for the day on the beach or a cabanna by the pool. You can also rent snorkeling equipment and boogie boards at the resort but if you take the short drive to Lahaina you can rent these for a fraction of the resort prices. We enjoyed our meals at this resort; the breakfast buffet had a great selection of fruit, pastries, and hot food and an omelette station. We also had supper at the steakhouse which gave an excellent steak/seafood meal. I wanted to go to the Japanese restaurant but saved that for another trip. In summary I have nothing bad to tell you about this resort. The service was good (but better in Lahaina), the rooms were clean and comfortable, the pool was well used by my family and the beach was wonderful. I went to the old Lahaina Luau instead of the resort luau and from what I observed the old Lahaina luau was more authentic.

When on vacation you shouldn't have to get up at 6am to get a chair. I didn't like how the general public was able to stroll through the pool area freely and cut through to Black Rock. They used the pool restrooms as the public bathroom and they had disgusting hygiene practices. The poor cleaner had the terrible job of having to clean up after them on a continuous basis. They need to make a public access walkway that doesn't go through the resort. The Westin guests were the worst. The number of times I heard them make disparging remarks about the hotel and yet didn't hesitate to use the pool lounge chairs and services. We tried to use the Westin pool and were told immediately only for Westin guests only. We would return to the Sheraton and hope they change the public beach access and the pool rules.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cDeluxe accomodations and can walk to snorkeling, eating and shopping\u201d", "Author": "Y0ungSter", "ReviewID": "UR72296710", "Content": "We loved this hotel because we could walk from our room and go snorkeling at Black Rock, one of the best places on Maui.

Our room was on the edge of the cliff at the Sheraton, and I would have to say it was the probably the best view on Kaanapali, with the best sunsets ever! The beds were comfy and our lanai was so nice we never wanted to go inside, and we had fun spotting turtles, too. The Sheraton's location is so good that we never wanted to leave. The snorkeling was great at Black Rock, especially if you go around to the left, past where the jumpers are. The turtles like the cliffs and we saw lots of fish and even an eagle ray. It was as good as Molokini, maybe better - certainly easier to get to! My daughter and son (15 and 18) loved the beach, we even got brave and jumped off the rock with the locals and tourists that line up during the day to take the plunge. I loved my morning walks on Kaanapali beach. The hotel has a good torchlighting ceremony, and the Cliff Dive bar is a fun place to sip a Mai Tai and watch the sunset but watch out!!! Eating there is really not a good idea - three not-so-good hamburgers and a couple of drinks ended up costing us $130! There's a pathway along the beach on both sides of the property to other hotels and to Whaler's Village, which is a fun place for shopping and food. The Castaway Cafe at the Kaanapali Villas (just past the Royal Lahaina, the opposite direction from Whaler's Village) was a great place for breakfast or lunch, too. Both locations were about a 10-15 minute walk from the Sheraton. Yes, the property is sort of a labyrinth, and it did take several elevators to get anywhere from our room, but, hey, the hotel was built in 1962 to fit onto a giant rock, so what do you expect!?

Our bell hop Andy was very friendly and gave us some great tips for the snorkeling and where to go to get any equipment we might need. The hotel is beautiful and the location at Black Rock was spectacular, we would walk out and get right into the ocean for our snorkeling, with plenty of fish and turtles around the rock. Andy recommended Boss Frogs in Lahaina for our snorkeling needs and we were very glad he did. Derek at Boss Frogs was very helpful and scheduled us on a snorkeling trip to Molokini which was wonderful. We sheduled the Frogman II cruise but were upgraded to the Quicksilver boat which was beautiful and the crew helpful, especially Thomas who gave my wife his towel when he saw she might be a little cool. We saw plenty of fish, some turtles, and quite a few dolphins. The lunch provided was great and the dollar drinks after snorkeling was a blast. We also booked our Road to Hana tour from Derek through Polynesian Adventure and it was spectacular. It was so nice not having to try and drive it myself and our tour guide Jeff was so friendly and informational. The shuttle from the hotel to Lahaina is priceless, we went into town about every night, and learned when the best happy hours were to help stretch our food dollar. make sure you go to Kimo's between 3 and 5, the calamari is $3.50 and was the best , they also have drink specials. If we didn't go into town we were at the Hula Grill in the whaler village which is a short walk from the Sheraton, and we sat at the Barefoot bar and listened to live music nightly.

The Black Rock Lawn was the perfect setting for our group of 44 people to watch them exchange vows and then enjoy cocktails and appetizers at sunset. We were afraid that it might be too hot but the lawn became shady just as we started (at 5 PM) , and there was a lovely ocean breeze. We were able to offer our guests some fantastic appetizers, including a Crab Puff and Stuffed Mushrooms which were both a big hit. After an hour long cocktail party we moved to The Coral Reef Room. One of the reasons we chose the Sheraton was that we could have a reception that lasted until 11:30 pm instead of an outdoor reception that would have had to end at 10 pm per Hawaiian law. The room is beautiful and required little extra decoration. The room size was the perfect size for dinner and dancing and the tall windows all around the room made the outside and inside seem one. Although some of the meals were not as we would have liked, the Sheraton Sales and Marketing Manager, Kristin Vines, made amends admirably. The stuffed chicken was the favorite choice of our guests. Although we had some bumps along the way with our wedding coordinator, Michelle Chang, she helped us pull off a wedding that was truly memorable. As with any service provider keeping copies of our notes and emails was helpful to us. Regarding the Sheraton as a location, we loved that most of our guests were able to stay five or more days there on-site with us, which allowed as all to enjoy many group events. The grounds are really the best in Kaanapali, in our opinion. Because the main section does not have really tall buildings and the grounds are spread out, it felt much more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old Hawaiian\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The beach was wide and the snorkeling right there was some of the best we experienced. The pool and outdoor bars were a great place for our group to enjoy each other\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s company. The Sheraton arranged favorable room rates for the group and all of our guests seemed very pleased with their rooms. The extra \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd seemed excessive at $26 per day per room, but we did take advantage of the town shuttle and Sheraton gym which the fee covered. http://www.sheraton-maui.com/weddings/ DJ Dan Viola was a perfect choice for us as he played all the music we requested and never \u00e2\u20ac\u0153took center stage\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. He is a true professional \u00e2\u20ac\u201c great to work with from beginning to end. http://www.djdanmaui.com/ The photographer, Tad Craig, was also terrific. Some of his photos are truly exceptional. He treated the wedding like he would a friend\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. He was excited, professional, patient and very talented. http://tadcraigphotography.com/ We opted to use our own florist rather than the one included with the Sheraton Wedding Package. The bouquets and flowers provided by Shelly at Country Bouquets were exactly what my daughter wanted and the level of communication was exceptional during the planning process. She went out of her way to make sure the flowers were there on time and she even added extra petals at no charge! http://countrybouquetsmaui.com/ The Minister, Rick Jackson, was arranged by the Sheraton wedding coordinator, Michelle Chang . He was a very good fit and did a lovely job of giving us a non-denominational wedding without too much religious reference but with great spirituality. Our group chartered the Gemini, a catamaran which left from the beach at the nearby Westin, for a rehearsal night get together. It was a wonderful group event with great food and lots of beverages, alcoholic and other. The price was reasonable and the staff was fun and provided great service. It was really special to have the whole group together the night before the wedding so that everyone could get to know each other. http://www.geminicharters.com/", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Savannah, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBeware: poor service, poor accommodation\u201d", "Author": "Noel85", "ReviewID": "UR71167517", "Content": "This is not a hotel for honeymooner!

Upon check in which was easy we were taken to our room by Andrew (thanks Andrew!! You were awesome!!) who was very informative and friendly!! The resort is BEAUTIFUL!!! Some people will say worn or dated but please show me a resort on an island where there is sand and trade winds that doesnt have any wear and I say you will probably have to pay an arm and a leg for it..it was not bad at all. We were in Tower 2 Room 2306. AWESOME View of the ocean and part of the resort!!!!! Our room did have 2 double beds and my suggestion to the Sheraton Would be to update to Queen size beds,.,, but we made do with it. The beds were so comfortable. We had a box of Caramacs in our room when we got there!! Thank you!!!!!!! My favorite candy now!! Our stay was wonderful. True we didnt spend much time there but enjoyed it when we did. I remember reading a review of someone saying there was whistling around the door when they were there. I did see that the door was not cut properly so there is a space where the wind can come in (Maybe Sheraton you need to check out the bottoms of the doors and replace where necessary?) but it was not a problem for us at all. We self parked which was just fine. No probs there. Plenty of parking available. Our kids enjoyed making sand castles on the beach. The surf was a little rough so we really had to watch our kids but we still had a blast. Was cool to watch people cliff diving off of Black Rock. Enjoyed our stroll over to Whalers Village along the nice path that runs in front of all of the resorts and next to the beach. Incredible views of Lanai!! There are signs up that do warn you about your property on the lounge chairs. I did NOT see anyone though take anyones property. The pool was awesome. A very nice shallow area for little kids to play in and a neat slide if you work your way around to it. They did hand out wristbands after asking for your room number but that was no biggie to us. Everyone was so friendly...Linsay at the Cliff bar was awesome as well as Grace - the hula dancer - You were so lovely and gracious Grace!!! Mahalo!!!! We enjoyed the nightly cliff diving show. Had an enjoyable dinner in the Black Rock Steakhouse. There was one incident when we had to go to the Main desk to give a CC for room incidentals. The Sheratons policy is a little crazy...if you use a debit card they want to put a crazy hold on it and we had had to use our Credit Card for our car rental but after calmly talking with Noah...he was very helpful and did say there are a variety of ways of dealing with this. He was very helpful. To the Sheraton...this might be a policy you want to rethink as it may really anger people off but I can also see that you want to get paid for room service etc. Check out was easy. It was so cool when I was printing our boarding passes at the kiosk in the lobby there were 2 baby geckos (or lizards) no bigger than the size of a quarter in the keyboard. I was concerned they would get squashed but it was fun to see them. I Have nothing but great things to say about the Sheraton. Oh also the first night we were there our bathroom door got locked somehow (it is a button that you push on the inside). We called and maintenance came right out. Our kids had fallen asleep and the maintenance guys were sooo quiet!!!! I really appreciated that. It was a wonderful trip and I will definitely go back to the Sheraton the next time I go to Maui.

When we first arrived we were greeted with Lei's and excellent service! The grounds are very big and we were escorted in a golf cart to our hotel room in Building 6. Building 6 is located ontop of Black Rock and the View of the ocean is just Breathtaking (You will see in my pictures). Of course I've read other reviews and yes, if you are on the 1st floor of building 6 you will not really have a direct view of the ocean, so be sure to ask for your room on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the building. The rooms are a nice size with a larger bathroom area and nice closet area too! The beds are comfy with lots of pillows, but I just wished for the linens to be a bit softer. They weren't terrible, but a bit rough. To get to the lobby area, or the pool/beach area it is a bit challenging at first but once you get the hang of it it's not bad. You have to go through multiple elevators and breezeways but it's a nice walk after a good dinner! The pool area is so large there were always plenty of chairs and room to swim in the pool. The snorkeling is awesome around Black Rock so we actually bought our own equipment at the local ABC Store and rented flippers. I loved how the beach access was right there too, so we constantly went back and forth between the beach and pool. Just make sure you are wearing your Sheraton wristband for the pool area. There are also jugs of ice water stationed around the pool area which is nice for a quick drink without having to go to the bar. Which leads me right into the bar area, our only disappointing thing about the hotel. They have 2 bars by the pool, Mai Tai bar and the Cliff Dive bar. The Mai Tai is only open til 3 pm so if you are sitting by that section of the pool, once they close there aren't any more servers for that side of the pool. It's quite interesting that they close at 3 when most people are still hanging out by the pool. So if you want food/drink you have to go to the Cliff Dive Bar which claims to have a happy hour, but we never saw any happy hour specials? I think happy hour was from like 4-6 but there were not any food or drink specials, which usually happy hour means some sort of special. I heard the bartender say the same price for drinks that were already on the standard menu. So we didn't normally hang out too much for happy hour, but it is nice to watch the cliff dive cermony which can also be viewed closer if you go on the beach. The cliff dive cermony is every night so don't worry if you miss one night! It is certainly a cool thing to see while there! The location is great and is close to Whalers Village which has 3 restaurants and tons of stores for shopping. There are also a few snack shops too if you want frozen yogurt or shaved ice or even pizza! We often went to Whaler's Village to walk around and there is a nice paved path from the hotel to the village along the beach. If you rent a car while here (highly recommended), then the town of Old Lahaina is also about 10 min down the road which is very cute and great for restaurants and shops as well (on Front Street). One more quick thing is that the hotel has a resort fee, which we did not mind at all. Rather than paying for parking or internet service the fee is $25/day and includes that and much more. We were at another hotel that charged $15/day just to use their internet, so we thought this resort charge was fine (unless you don't have a laptop or a car so I could see why people would mind it), but if you know ahead of time, then you may as well make use of it!!

From the time I entered the open-air lobby with the beautiful views and the gentle sea breezes flowing through with the sounds of island music I felt the aloha spirit. The views on the front side of the ocean lawn with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical foliage, the exotic flowers, the ocean and Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach, the Islands of Molokai and Lanai and the Black Rock. The back side with the magnificent mountain and the many rainbows. I was in paradise. We were upgraded from a King ocean view to a King ocean view suite. These accommodations featured rooms of rich wood tones, Hawaiian prints, a private lanai, flat screen hi-definition television with a large bathroom. I was impressed by the location along the beautiful Kaanapali Beach with the Torch Lighting and cliff-diving ceremony at Black Rock, which takes place at sunset. It also is the most quiet and private part of the Ka'anapali Beach yet within easy walking distance of the central shopping and dining area of the resort, Whaler's Village. Since it is spread out over 23 acres, you never get the sense that the resort is crowded. There always seems to be a place where you can get away from everyone and just breathe in the Maui air or gaze at night into the star-filled sky. Each morning we enjoyed the wonderful breakfast buffet on the Keka'a Terrace with the early morning sunshine and gentle breeze and the breathtaking view of pu\u00e2\u20ac\u2122u keka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a in the distance and the wooden bridge over a fresh water koi by our outdoor seating. The days were filled with so much to see and do, though we were able to have a few hours to enjoy the beach and the Lagoon pool. The fresh pineapple and tropical smoothies were delicious. Dinner Under the Stars program features three enticing menus, a private butler, and your personal selection of the perfect dining location on the 23 acres of lush foliage and breathtaking ocean views. We chose the beachfront bungalow. It was a special evening for celebrating our anniversary. Our week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s itinerary was full Friday: Arrived in Maui in the late afternoon preparing for the days ahead. Watched the Black Rock torch lighting and cliff diving ceremony and walked to dinner at the Hula Grill at Whalers Village. Saturday: Awoke at 2:30 for the Mt. Haleakala Sunset bike tour. At the end of the ride we had brunch and walked around the town of Paia. Spent the remaining of day on the beach and around the Lagoon pool. We had dinner at the Plantation House in Kapalu. Sunday: The Road to Hana with dinner at Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House in Paia. Monday: Spend the morning shopping, seeing the Banyan Tree, and the old prison in Lahaina eating lunch at Cheeseburgers in Paradise. Afternoon at beach and Lagoon pool. The evening at the Old Lahaina Luau. Tuesday: Drove clockwise around the western part of the island with so much to see. Later dinner at Leilana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the beach at Whalers Village. Wednesday: Took the ferry to Moloka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122I for the day. Dinner at Longi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Lahaina and the show at Warren and Annabelles. Thursday: Iao Valley State Park for the morning then driving back up to Mt. Haleakala. We wanted to hike down the volcano, but the fog was too thick. Dinner under the Stars at the Sheraton. Friday: Enjoyed morning on the beach and the Lagoon pool with lunch on Keka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a Terrace.

Originally I was booked into the Westin (that's right, for some reason I failed to heed the warnings of other trip advisors.) As others have mentioned, the Westin was NOISEY and crowded, the staff was indifferent and our room smelled like mold...not a normal Westin experience. We stayed one night and moved to the Sheraton the very next morning. Evelyn at the front desk of the Sheraton was oustanding and went the extra mile to find us a beautiful room in building number 4 with an ocean view (although even the rooms that face the mountains seemed to be quite nice.) The room was clean and fresh and spacious. We had a nice balcony to sit on with chairs and table. A little fridge helped us keep beer, wine, and snacks cold. Next we met Trevor who helped with our bags. He spent a good 10 minutes talking to me about special off the beaten path things to do. (We took many of his suggestions and they were all great). Finally, I must commend Rhiki who worked the poolside resturant and bar service. She took my order and remembered it (Bloody Mary-no olives) and me two whole days later. I did hear overhear some other waitstaff expressing concern about their hours being cut. Although every staff person we encountered was cheerful and competent, if I were managing this hotel, these three employees would get as many hours as I could give them. They seemed proud of their work and are excellent representatives of Sheraton and Starwood. One thing to note, it is hard to judge the quality of the pool at this hotel from the pictures provided on the internet. Let me assure you the pool is lovely, plenty of chairs and places to find shade. At the Westin I was told by one bartender that we needed to have our pool spot saved by 7AM. At the Sheraton there were still plenty of seats available by 9:30 AM and many came open throughout the day. The beach access is quite convenient and good snorkeling right there. The grounds are quite spread out, the views are stunning throughout the resort, and there are many places to just sit and read or chill. There are various forms of entertainment and live music every night that was quite enjoyable. Excellent little computer center on site if you need it. We found it to be relaxing and mellow, as a trip to Hawaii should be. We opted to have breakfast included in our room rate and it was completely worth it. Food was very good.

It is a bit of a trek to the beach and the pool, but it is worth it, I would suggest a higher floor unless you are traveling with children.

I then read the reviews and started to worry. After staying here 4 days I now have come to the conclusion that the people who take time to write reviews in many cases are the handful of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hard to please with anything\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crowd, or the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am a natural complainer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd crowd. I have stayed at hundreds of beach resorts all over the word (see my other reviews) so here is what I thought: 1.)When I arrived I was greeted with one day of free valet parking. Nice! 2.)Remember, I booked on HotWire so when I arrived I asked for a king bed. She said none were available. I asked if any could be cleaned, and she called housekeeping. I had to wait an hour, but I got a king with a partial ocean view. All with a smile. 3.)The room was about the same as any other Sheraton, except the bed was rather hard, and not the lux level of mainland business hotels. 4.)The room was clean and well stocked, flat TV, nice balcony and easy to access internet that was reliable. We ran a travel router, made the room wifi and had no issues. 5.)Breakfast was awesome! But at $30 a person a little steep. A lot of people had breakfast coupons, so I imagine if you book at the Sheraton website, you pay more for your room but get the breakfast. 6.)The pools were awesome. As for no kids pool, the pool snakes from 3 feet to 8 feet, and clearly the shallow end (a football field away) has the kids, and there are plenty of coves, hideaways, and turns to escape any kids. This was not a real issue. 7.)I broke the coffee pot. Housekeeping was there instantly to clean it up, and with a new coffee pot. Nothing but smiles. 8.)I got the best massage ever in the spa, I was very happy. I have gotten a lot of resort massages, this was among the best. 9.)The sea and beach are wonderful. 10.)The best thing about this hotel is the location. You can easily walk to Whater Village to shop and get a decent breakfast for half the price of the hotel. Cane and Taro had much better food and service than Hula. 11.)Remember, I booked on hotwire, and resort hotels usually are heard to get a late check-out. But just to see if I could I went to the desk and although it took a bit of convincing, I got a checkout for after lunch... 12.)The condition of the hotel is similar to other ocean front 4-star properties. A few people commented on the condition of the property. I found it similar to all weather beaten hotels with lots of sand, surf and winds to take its toll. I went int the Westin, Royal Lahaina and Ritz, it was about the same... 13.)For those who have never been to Maui, it is VERY quiet at night. There is not a lot to do. Rent a car or you will miss a lot, taxis are rarely seen and things are too spread out on the island to afford taxi rides. We went one night to Mama's Fish House. It is about an hour drive, but worth it. Awesome place. Sheraton Maui had very attentive service in the restaurant, valet, concierge, desk and housekeeping. The grounds were certainly well kept and consistent with the other hotels on the island, and overall a great value. As for the $25 resort fee each day... well that is the parking and internet you would have paid at another hotel. Either way, its all the same money, and I run into this at most of the resorts I stay at, and in many places the fee is higher. I was here on a romantic getaway, I would recommend this to any couple seeking a quiet place to spend quality time swimming, dining, walking, and relaxing together. It was very nice.

Our wants were a nice beach and a resort that wasn't a complete zoo (i.e. a bunch of kids running around or just really overcrowded). The agent from SPG suggested the Sheraton due to the beach and the fact that the Westin is more \"kid friendly\". While that sounded great, I've always viewed Westin as the superior brand between the two. Despite some last minute arguments/suggestions from a colleague to switch to the Westin, we decided to follow our original plan and stay at the Sheraton. We couldn't have been more happy with our decision. As a result, this review will have some focus on what we noticed as a difference between the two (Westin is three hotels to the south), We were upgraded to a Ocean View Junior Suite in building two (referred to as a \"Ohana Suite\" on SPG.com photos). While the room wasn't modern chic as you'd expect from a Westin, it was very much Hawaiian (or at least more \"resort\" feeling). While we didn't tour any of the Westin rooms, I can say that I've stayed at several SPG, Marriott locations where you wouldn't know if you were on the beach or in the middle of Tulsa if you didn't look out the window. In the room and on the large double balcony, the Sheraton Maui definitely has its own style... in a good way. Building two is situated between the ocean and the lawn, thus there was no restaurant/pool noise to contend with. The other two buildings (3 and 1) are slightly angled towards the ocean, but not straight on like 2. Thus we found the views and sounds to be really relaxing. The only drawback was that we were not close enough to hear the ocean waves a night, this is due to the distance of most of the buildings at the Sheraton from the water. The pool was good but not great, it was never too crowded but the poolside chairs were snatched up pretty quickly. There is a no \"adults only\" area, but the kids pretty much staying near the shallow end which is separated by a space occupied by a bar, pool attendant stand and garden. The beach was the highlight... Black Rock, the end of this side of Ka'anapali beach, is the end border of the Sheraton and it has the best snorkeling on the beach. People would come from all other resorts to snorkel around, so being the closest to it was a huge plus. While the surf wasn't as high in front of the Sheraton, it was the nicest area to plop a towel down and jump in to relax. Unlike the other areas to close to Whalers Village, there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a bevy of tour/adventure ships coming in and out all day clogging the beach and spewing exhaust. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants with the exception of the poolside bar, which was okay. So I can't offer up any review on food. There are so many dining options on Maui outside of the resort that if you can you should explore. Our favorites... SanSei Sushi, China Boat (standard Chinese fare), Tia Juana's (great taco's), Mama's House (seafood). Comparing our experience to what we noticed down the beach... the Sheraton was less crowded (both pool and beach) and seems a little more laid back. We had a spa treatment at the Westin on our last day, and as we walked through the zoo of a pool area (and past the crowded beach) we were happy for the slower pace and more space that the Sheraton provided. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind crowds or have children and want more of a water park type atmosphere, check out the Westin and its reviews. If you aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t looking for a four/five star resort (not sure if there truly is one on Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali), but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to stay at a dive, the Sheraton is a great place to stay.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kalamazoo, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cCouldn't even sleep in same bed on honeymoon...Wouldn't honor the king bed we reserved on our honeymoon.\u201d", "Author": "lucylue733", "ReviewID": "UR67104526", "Content": "My husband & I reserved this hotel for our long-awaited honeymoon & they claimed they didn't have the king-bed room available that we reserved several months earlier.

Before deciding on our hotel I did a lot of internet searching and read all the reviews about the 4 major hotels I was considering (Sheraton, Weston, Marriott and Hyatt). We went to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and had waited 10 years for this vacation. When we arrived we were immediately greeted and told our room had been upgraded to an ocean front room in Building 6. Having read the reviews about the views in this building I knew this would be the start of a great vacation. The only down side was that the king bed I requested wasn't available with the upgrade, we'd have 2 double beds. Not a big deal for us but if I were on my honeymoon I'm sure I wouldn't have looked at it that way. Our room was truly ocean front and was so beautiful, we had a view of 2 neighboring islands and Black Rock, slept with sliding doors open and fell asleep listening to the waves crashing against the rocks. The resort is kept beautifully. Someone always cleaning the outdoor areas, grass and plantings perfectly trimmed. Yes, there were times that it was hard to find a chair under an umbrella around the pool, but we also were fine with going down a little later in the day when the sun wouldn't be as intense and the pool area not as busy. We didn't eat at the hotel except to order snacks and drinks at the pool, not cheap but any of the resorts I listed will be just as costly. Same for the resort fee--they are all within the same range of $25/day. I think the Hyatt might have been a little less. Don't travel to Hawaii if you aren't ready to spend a little more for things. We waited a long time for this special vacation and it was well worth it. The staff were all friendly and would chat with you at the pool. Checked out the other resorts and none of them had the lawn and open space that the Sheraton had. Also liked that the area of the pool that was 8 feet deep was a little quieter--no really young children in that area. When looking at all the resorts I wanted one that felt like Hawaii, lots of open space with lush gardens and landscaping and not a huge tower building and the Sheraton provided that. Their tallest building is only 8 stories. Our room was large, spotless and the lanai had plenty of room. Had an area with a small refrigerator, coffee maker and a microwave and a cabinet for grocery items. They replenished the coffee, creamer, etc., every day. Have no idea what the other rooms looked like. Two suggestions: The hotel needs to make it more widely known that it is a totally smoke free facility. I never saw any such signs and there was not designated smoking area for guests who smoke. Husband and I don't smoke and don't care to be around it. A few days into our stay someone in a room near us was smoking--chain smoking--and the smoke kept blowing to our lanai and into our room if the doors were opened. We talked to the manager and he did move us to another room that same day. Unfortunately, the new room had the same situation. People lighting up on the ground level (we were on the second floor) and someone smoking a cigar. I don't think people realized all smoking was off limits. One other suggestion---would be great if there were some palm trees on the beach to help with some shade. Other than the smoking and no shade on the beach, which were minor issues to us in the whole scheme of things, we would definitely stay at the Sheraton again and recommend it to a friend.

I specifically emailed ahead of time requesting building 6 (after ready many reviews). Glad we did! There is a parking lot right there, so convienient!

The pools and hot tubs are great (although a little more kid friendly that we would have liked) We were trying to stay at a hotel with not too many children, this was hard to find.

There is staff that comes around checking to see if you are a guest at the hotel.

Even worse--the cabana was next to the kid's end of the pool. Screaming children is NOT my idea of a relaxing environment and there was a crowd of drunken college students right outside my not-so-private cabana having a high volume inappropriate conversation.

(Our first three nights were AWESOME at the Outrigger Waikiki!). Let me preface this posting by saying that we are the most \"low maintenance\" people you have ever met - it has to be pretty bad for me to complain about anything. I did research for about 7 months before deciding where to stay and what kind of room to stay in. We knew that we were going to splurge and get ocean front rooms for the whole trip so that we could hear the waves all night with the door open. After reading many positive reviews, we booked a deluxe ocean front room at the Sheraton. I had done extentive research and didn't think it would be possible to be surprised by anything....well... after getting to the hotel early evening, we were told that we had a room with two double beds. Not terribly shocking because lots of people complain about that on this website. My husband went to the desk and they were able to move us to a king room. One of the \"perks\" that this hotel claims is that the first night has free valet parking - great right? Someone to park your car and get all of the bags in the room - awesome. What the bell desk told us was that since we were in Building 6, \"it will just be easier for you to drive up there yourselves and get to your room\". Nice. So we get to our room and it was exactly as I had expected. I had looked at many pictures and the room was perfectly beautiful, but we open the door to the lanai and listen - and wait and listen - and sit and listen......no surf. There was absolutely no wave sounds at all - this isn't something that I've read or heard about anywhere. We tried to look at the info in our room to see what restaurants/bars were open and there was no information - my husband called and the only thing open was the steakhouse and the bar. We went to the bar and there was no place to sit so they referred us to the computer desks and gave us menus. We shared a sandwich and went back to our room. I called the front desk and told her what was going on and she agreed to show us an Ocean Front room the next day. The next morning we looked at the room and immediately knew that this was a better fit for us - lots of wave sounds and a beautiful view of the beach. We booked our trip through FunJet, so I called them to tell them what was going on and asked how the room rate difference would work. They informed me that the hotel would bill them for the actual room that we were staying in and since it was a catagory lower, we would be refunded the difference - perfect. I spoke to the front desk when we got our room keys and we were told that because we 'pre-paid' we would be charged for the room we booked, not the room we were staying in. We would only get a credit if he hadn't already paid! How does that make sense? I told her that we would be happy if they gave us the difference in resort credit we were fine to eat there and spend the money there. My husband told her that if they gave us snorkel masks and fins for the week we would be happy! ha. - but there was no Aloha spirit here. There would be no adjustments. She even called our room later to let me know that she spoke to her manager and that there would be NO adjustments! Ok - thanks for the call. Unbelievable. I've got to say that the restaurant staff at breakfast was phenomenal - we loved them and they were so friendly and service oriented. We were there for two days of the pool deck repairs that others have discussed and it was awful, but lucky for us, it ended while we were still there. It also did not impress my husband when we sat at the pool bar at 2:45pm to order a drink and a sandwich and were told that the bar closed in 15 minutes! Yep - just as everyone has commented, the pool bar closes at 3:00pm - even on holiday weekends when it's packed.

There, our waiter, Tony, remembered us from our last visit approximately six month earlier, greeting us by name! At the end of dinner, the staff brought us a special dessert of volcano chocolate cake plated with the words \"welcome back Mr. and Mrs. Miller\". The beach bar had equally wonderful staff, in particular, Linsay, who served us with flair and made the \"tough decisions\" on which drink we should have! We were also greeted by Grace, the evening hula dancer, who carried the warmth of the Hawaiian spirit that this property embodies everywhere. No \"deferred maintenance\" apparent here, the property is in wonderful shape, this should be your first choice on Maui.

It was also equiped with a coffee maker (along with some Kona coffee) and a refrigerator/freezer, which turned out to be very convenient for chiling that bottle of wine we shared on numerous nights after spending endless days exploring the island (Road to Hana\" - put on your list of must to do's) shopping at the local \"Whalers Village\" (conveniently located just a block or two away), and dining at the local restaurants. The breakfast buffet was fabulous with made to order omelets, fresh local fruits, everything you could possibly desire.

My husband and I extended our stay on a different island and stayed in a different hotel.

We had a room with 2 double beds, a living room, a small fridge, huge bathroom w/ 2 showers and a queen size Murphy bed.

The pools were fantastic, I loved the way they were connected together and you could roam from pool to pool in the water. The resort was very family & baby friendly but we were never overwhelmed by children. The beach in front of the hotel is the best in Maui (IMHO). There is fantastic snorkeling when you walk in the water - we saw the local sea turtle Volkswagen several times. We also saw several large Rays which were unusual. Don't get your snorkel gear at the hotel though - it's much less expensive to rent for a week from Snorkel Bob's in Lahaina. Do pay attention to the Jelly fish warnings because they are there occasionally depending on the current. We rented a cabana lounge chairs from the hotel on the couple days that we stayed at the hotel all day and it was worth the price to have the option of shade. The Kaanapali area was a great base for our trip, there are great restaurants in Whaler's Village (Hula Grill was our fav) and it's a nice walk in the morning to go to the end of Kannaapali beach and back.

This is my second stay at this resort, my first stay was in April 2008. I loved my stay here in 2008. However, my second visit left much to be desired. First of all, I specifically chose this resort based on my first stay because I knew there was an adult pool with good service and I was on vacation for one thing and one thing only...to lay in the sun at the pool and relax. Nothing else. So imagine my disappointment when on the morning after my arrival, the adult pool was closed with workmen all around. Now, note that nothing was posted in the hotel or in my room and nothing was mentioned to me upon arrival (much less prior to arrival) that the pool would be closed. I had to call, get transferred around to find out the details. When I was reminded that the other pool was still open (the kids pool) and I clearly communicated my dissatisfaction as I didn't want to be at a pool with kids who are loud (kids scream while in the pool) and offer a less than peaceful pool experience, I was told a guest manager would call me. No one ever called me. I did not enjoy my experience at the kids pool. The layout is small, cramped and the majority of the chairs are on the grass, which isn't ideal. All the chairs on the grass were wet each day and the rest of the chairs left limited options. There were screaming kids every day, however due to the time of year it wasn't as bad as it could have been. One server, Claudia provided amazing service remembering guests by name and giving excellent service. However, the remainder of the servers at the pool during my stay, have a lot of room for improvement. One server never once approached me despite my lengthy stay at the pool all day and one server forgot to bring me my drink until much later (she did apologize). More than one server is needed each day. The pool hours begin at 8:00, however one day the majority of the chairs were not set up until almost 10:00. There was routine landscaping going on and while maintenance is necessary, the sound and smell (gasoline) of the trimmers, blowers, etc was disturbing. I have not stayed in any resort where I had to experience this during pool hours. I understand the need for the wristband to ensure only hotel guests are using the pool, but it seems like there might be a better way than having someone walk around and disturb guests while relaxing in the sun or swimming in the pool. Some of the pool staff put on the wristbands without even checking room numbers and I witnessed a non-hotel guest get a wristband. What's the point? Seems pointless as it seems no one really checks accurately anyway throughout the day. The rooms are clean and the all white beds are great. However, the rooms are looking a little tired and dated. It's time for refreshing with new carpet, new furniture and a bathroom remodel. This includes the lanai furniture. I used a car service and expected upon arrival for the bell staff to take my bag from my driver, but that did not happen. When I went to the stand out front and answered yes that I wanted the bell staff to take my bag to my room, she yelled across the entrance to call a bell staff member over. That was not an ideal experience. They do offer seamless check in, but you have to stop by the front desk later to provide a credit card. Based on my 2008 stay, I had hoped the Sheraton Maui would become my \"go to\" resort for my annual trip to Hawaii, but based on this last experience, I am not sure that will happen. I don't spend thousands of dollars to not have the experience I expect. This experience left a lot to be desired. To sum up: -Adult pool closed with no notice, no price concession despite my unhappiness. -Being a SPG, I would like to think that there could be notice given for pool closures, etc to ensure a positive experience. At the very least, I expect follow up and price concessions when a significant dissatisfaction is voiced. Extremely unhappy with this. -Bell service upon check in could be more professional. Greeting guests as they exit cars, etc instead of waiting for them to drag themselves to the stand. -Pool service needs improvement, including servers and pool staff. -Rooms need updating. Hotel is starting to look aged. -The $26 per day resort charge is a joke. Either eliminate it or work into the price of the room, but it's a stupid charge that the Sheraton tries to justify, but frankly it isn't justifiable. Overall, I was disappointed and it's highly unlikely that I will return to the Sheraton Maui despite my plans to return to Maui at least once a year. I will most likely try out other resorts to try and find my 'go to\" resort for my annual trip.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "4qqqq", "ReviewID": "UR64042177", "Content": "This is a very nice hotel. We had a wonderful stay. Upon check in they did not have the king size bed that had been booked. I was not surprised since I have read this from other guests but they said they would correct it in the morning. When we arrived it was 9:00 at night and couldn't tell our location since it was dark. When we woke up - wow, what a view! We had a patio room in building 2. I was more than happy to stay in this room and have the double beds. I have heard stories of up and down on the evelvators and I didn't want to deal with that. This room worked out very well for us. Not one elevator or stair case to deal with. This was nice! Only 110 steps to the beach and about 225 steps to the pool. Close to the parking garage too. More than happy with this room!! We took advantage of the \"green\" program and didn't have maid service one day. They gave us a credit of $35.00 towards dinner. We figured we would use it for dinner at Blackrock Steak. People kept saying how expensive Blackrock Steak is, and it was, but it was about the same as any other restaurant in town. Everything is ala carte and everything was pricey, but it seemed to be in range with all of the others. I was happy to have the credit. The stuffed chicken breast a extremely tastey. Our dinner ended up to be less expensive (using the credit) than it was at Mama's Fish House for lunch. Everything at the hotel is extremely pricey. Hamburgers at the pool grill were $17 or $19. That is beyond rude if you ask me. Tip: We went next door to the Kaanapali Hotel and had lunch at their poolside grill \"Tiki Hut\" (I think) and the burgers there were $8.00 -9.00. Much better prices and very good. A basket of fries (very large) was only $2.95. We couldn't even eat all of them. Go there. The pool was impressive. We liked how it was a lazy river effect. Very cold though. I'm not sure which was colder the ocean or the pool. We took advantage of both. One day the pool and one day the ocean, one day the pool and one day the ocean. Such choice we had to make. We snorkled a couple of times in the ocean next to blackrock. It was worth it. Saw some really colorful fish and a massive size sea turtle. I know sea turtle are all different sizes, but I was not expecting this size. That was great! The location of the hotel is perfect. Next to blackrock and also a short walk to Whalers Village.

The swimming pool area is really a complex of multiple pools with islands for food/recreating in the middle. There are hamocks nearby. The pool was busy with loud, animated and lively guests of diverse ages and cultural backgrounds until a serious drizzle retired most hotel guests. The showcase dive from the cliff was dramatic/twillight zony and kitsch (voice narrative about ancient rituals accompanied by solemn music and drumming) but extremely enjoyable for my kids.

Room included a wet bar, two televisions, a separate sitting area and two balconies. BEST hotel room I've ever stayed in, hands down!!! -Food was great (and I am very picky.) We had breakfast vouchers for the buffet each morning and ate twice at the Sheraton and once at the Westin (there is a stay at one, dine at all program.) The buffet was fresh, perfectly cooked, and plentiful. We enjoyed sitting outside and taking in the view while eating breakfast. -Pool is awesome! Gorgeous landscaping and lots of chairs. We were able to get a chair under an umbrella very easily, and would get in the water to cool off from the hot Hawaiian sun. The pool is a tad bit cold for my taste, but husband thought it was perfect. -Ate lunch poolside at the bar/restaurant and the food was very good...typical beach/pool fare. Thought the frozen drinks were well made and quite a bit of liquor for the price so I didn't mind the check. -Snorkeling at black rock is phenomenal. We've been all over the Caribbean and this was by far the best snorkeling we've done. Calm water, brilliantly colored fish, and helpful staff to rent out the snorkel equipment. Sad that we only did it the last day! -The Kaanapali area in general is very pedestrian friendly and the shopping area at Whaler's Village is perfect.

The main reason we picked the Sheraton Maui was three-fold, (1) It was located right on a great stretch of Kaanapali Beach, right by Black Rock, (2) it was about as affordable as a luxury hotel on the beach gets in Maui, and (3) a breakfast plan was included in the price. We originally booked an Ocean View room, which was upgraded by the front desk staff because they did not have a King bed available. So, we ended up getting moved to a Deluxe Ocean Front room, which, despite the name, are actually located kind of far from the beach itself. However, the lanai outside of the room looked out directly over Black Rock and the ocean, and the view was gorgeous. In the mornings, you could sit out with a cup of coffee and watch the turtles come to surface on the quiet side of Black Rock. The room itself was okay -- nothing spectacular. The beds were reasonably comfortable and there was a mini-fridge, which made eating/drinking a bit less expensive than it might have otherwise been. (If I have on tip for travelers to Maui: buy a supply of drinks and snacks, because dining on this island is incredibly costly.) The grounds are nice, well-manicured, but so vast and maze-like that it took us nearly 5 minutes of walking to get to the beach. Self-parking was easy from our location, as the Ocean Front rooms have private parking near the rear of the resort. Dining was decent. We ate at the breakfast buffet every morning -- there was a large variety of foods and the coffee was excellent; but despite the variety, it still got old by our final morning. We only ate on-site one evening, at the Black Rock Steak & Seafood restaurant, and I don't recommend eating here. It was overpriced and the food was mediocre. The staff, though we didn't deal with them a whole lot, was friendly and attentive, and I don't have any major complaints about the resort. Its biggest plus is definitely the location, as its probably the best stretch of beach along all of Kaanapali. If you love snorkeling, you'll enjoy the Sheraton's extreme proximity to Black Rock. My wife and I are likely coming back to Maui next year during whale season, but it's unlikely we'll stay here again. Not that it's so bad, but just that we'd like to try somewhere new, and we'll probably head south to Wailea. This hotel is a pretty good value, based on its location alone.

Unfortunately, it's just not there at Sheraton Maui. While they were accommodating to our requests, they just weren't friendly, and didn't go at all out of their way to make us feel like valued guests. Since we are Starwood Gold we were \"upgraded\" to a mountain view, but as it was right next to an elevator we had to move after the first night. We also weren't told the balcony on the room was so thin there couldn't be a table or chair on it. We had to find out on our own after a few days that it was MUCH more convenient to park in the tennis court lot rather than the parking garage. When I asked about upgrading to an ocean view the front desk wasn't clear at all, and it was only when I spoke with the time share person who had Starwood status in previous corporate life that I got the full and friendly answer. The front desk staff seemed like they were always doing other paperwork tasks, so their lack of connection may be due to conflicting management's demands. The hotel offers a $25 to $35 credit if you skip housekeeping. At first this seems like a nice gesture to offset the $26 required resort fee. However, the credit is not cumulative, and is only valid at 2 high-priced restaurants where guests are already offered a 20% discount. People who eat at those restaurants probably wouldn't value the discount. So the discount seems totally for the hotel's benefit as a way to up-sell people for the hotel's benefit. A $25 credit directly to the bill or that could be used for any non-room hotel purchase would be much more satisfying. There's a lot to like about the Sheraton Maui. The grounds are wonderful. As we didn't have an ocean view, we particularly enjoyed sitting on the chairs midway through the 5th floor of building 3. There's also a nice lounge area in the 8th floor of building 6 (the one with the fitness center on 7th floor). It's fun to watch the sunset and cliff divers at the same time. You can walk south along the resorts or north along the golf course and less developed areas. During our stay we were attending a conference at the Hyatt. We noticed that winds at the Sheraton were FAR greater than at the Hyatt, which frequently had no winds at all, while the Sheraton would have such strong winds that it was uncomfortable being outside. The Sheraton Maui did a great job of sending a pre-visit email, account statement by e-mail, and post-visit e-mail. Unfortunately the staff attitude didn't match the attitude of the e-mails. There was no request for a survey in the email or in the room papers.

The breakfast buffet was good and convenient but was fairly repetitive after a few days. They do have the best bacon. We would not likely eat this if it was not part of our room rate. The beach was certainly different than previous years - we had heard it was smaller but were startled by how much had been lost to the surf. It was still fine and we never had any problems finding a spot. It was a little windy and choppy while we were there and being up next to Black Rock was nice given the weather. If there was one thing to improve this property - it would be heat the pool during the winter. There were a couple of days that it was too windy to be on the beach and even though the air temperature was warm - there was hardly anyone in the pool. It is just too cold.

In fact I timed it and the longest time was 5 minutes and I am in my 50's and not exatly physically fit.

The breakfast buffet was fine - most days wait was about 5 minutes for a table and only a couple of days waited 10 to 15 minutes - not bad considering it was spring break. The other point I need to clarify for folks is the condition of the beach. Yes, it was shocking to see how much smaller the sandy area was - note it is smaller it has not disappeared. Still room for beach chairs. Two things though which bothered us though was 1) the pool was freezing at all times - even on hot days when there is absolutely no breeze. We tested the water in other pools in the ares and the Westin and Hyatt were cold as well, but some of the cheaper 2/3 star type places were heated! 2) You can no longer rent tanks for diving from the dive shack on the property - even if you have all your own equipment you will be charged $80 per person for the full deal.

Rooms - I was impressed with the room. I was traveling with a good friend and we had 2 doubles and I thought the room was pretty well sized. It had 2 beds with duvets, 2 dressers each with 3 1/2 large drawers. The closet was pretty large too with a good size safe (probably large enough for a laptop but I didn't put mine in there). There was a flat panel tv (37\"?). The bathroom was also pretty big and had a shower/tub combo and a door separated the rest of the bathroom from the toilet. I wouldn't say that the room's huge and there's not much in the way of a work desk, but I was on vacation and just wanted a decent enough room - I wanted to be outside as much as possible. As for the look of the room, it looked pretty up to date for me - the carpeting, furniture, etc. seemed new or at least very lightly worn and the A/C worked well. Whether all rooms are updated I could not say, but I was happy that our room was nice and up to date. And the maid service was very good. Our first floor, garden view location was nothing beautiful, but I paid only $200/night and figured I'd create my own views. Driving around the island, walking around the hotel and driving up to Haleakala solved any concerns I had with our room location and view. In any event, no matter where you stay at the hotel, you will have to walk quite a bit. The property was very spacious - ok with me since I love to walk. We were closest to the main parking lot so that's where we parked. It was never full so don't worry about getting a spot. As for internet in the room, it is high speed, but not wireless. The cord is pretty short so you will have to use your laptop in bed. I've read some complain about the speed but I thought it was plenty past enough and I never had the slightest difficulty with connection speed. Food - The only meal I ate was at the breakfast buffet. It's fine if you like a lot of food, and the pastries were decent but it's certainly not worth the approximate $30 tab - average at best omelets, and otherwise standard and mediocre heaps of classic buffet food. The buffet tables are also set in an oddly lighted room separate from dining tables and this didn't help make the food look appealing. I also had breakfast at the Westin and Hyatt buffets - the Hyatt had the most beautiful view but I found the food at all 3 buffets to be very similar (as were the prices). The pool area - The pool is really beautiful. Wide at parts, narrow and winding elsewhere, and overall huge and nicely landscaped. There's a very, very small slide . . . not like the much larger slides at the Westin and Hyatt (hence, fewer children at the Sheraton). The water temperature was always chilly - sometimes very, very cold. However, I spent most of my time in the warmer ocean water. Although seating right around the pool is a little limited, we always found plenty of seating in a soft, grassy area (pictured below) right near the pool which offered quick access to both the beach and the pool. They require you to use a towel card at the pool, but if you want an extra card, they'll give you that at the front desk and I didn't find anyone employed by the hotel to be particularly concerned about the towel cards. I was more annoyed that they'd always give you a paper wrist bracelet at the pool to ensure that only hotel guests are at the pool. It was just a little too impersonal to me. The beach - The beach is pretty washed away but there's room for some lounge chairs. But I enjoyed just sitting in the grassy area in lounge chairs between the pool and beach and snorkeling and swimming or going in the pool when I chose - it only took 30 seconds to walk to the ocean or pool from this area. I snorkeled several times and was a little disappointed the first couple of times. The water was just so murky. Then one day the water was so clear, like a bathtub and I saw a few turtles, an eel and so many colorful fish. You just have to keep trying I suppose. It gets a bit crowded but you just have to swim around the curb of the black rock (just make sure you have fins and are a good swimmer) for the best snorkeling spot and some beautiful coral. They sell underwater cameras in the gift shop for only $10 (shocking). The proximity to Black Rock makes the Sheraton location so ideal for me. There are few locations where you can snorkel right from the beach with easy water access and have such excellent snorkeling. Fitness room - It's fine, nothing great. There are a few weight machines, a few treadmills and a few ellipticals, a couple of bikes, dumbbells and televisions. There are also locker rooms and showers for guests who have later flights. I inspected the Westin fitness room which was much nicer, with a great view of the ocean and more machines. Location - if you're choosing a hotel on Ka'anapali Beach, it seems to me that you have some pretty nice choices. I really liked the fact that the Sheraton seemed to have fewer kids and more adults than at the Westin and Hyatt. I'm pretty sure this had a lot to do with the large water slides at the aforementioned spots. Whaler's Village, a short walk away has a few restaurants, some fast food, and some decent stores. There's not a lot of night life on Ka'anapali Beach, but Lahaina is less than a 10-minute drive and there's a little more activity there. Having driven to Kapalua and Wailea, I'd say we chose the right spot for both relaxation and some night life. Resort fee - Yes, the $26 resort fee is a joke (supposedly goes toward parking, internet fitness - kind of like having to buy tires separate from a new car), but oh well. I think it's a scam to make the hotel seem less expensive and this is too bad . . . it makes the hotel look bad. But overall, I really enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton and if/when I return to Maui, I'm likely to choose it again. I prefer the Ka'anapali Beach location and the Sheraton was the right hotel for me. I will say that although the Westin looked like a nicer hotel from the outside, I preferred being closer to Black Rock and having a more adult atmosphere for this vacation.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carmel, CA", "Title": "\u201cIn my opinion, this is THE place to stay in Kaanapali\u201d", "Author": "Travelhabit", "ReviewID": "UR58099364", "Content": "I recently spent 4 nights at the Sheraton Maui in Kaanapali, having chosen it from TripAdvisor reviews (thank you!) I wanted a place just to hang out and relax after my hubby left for the mainland and I had some spare time. I hadn't been to Kaanapali to stay in a hotel in all our years of coming to Hawaii -- approx. 25 visits to Hawaii -- so was anxious to try it and to check it out as an area for possibly having our grandkids come stay with us. First of all, you have to be pretty pushy to get what you want here, but once you figure it out, it is a very nice property, by far the best I saw along the Kaanapali \"strip\". I booked an Oceanfront room, but the room I stayed in the first night really just looked over a large lawn and the pool area beyond to the ocean. I noticed -- and was told by my bellman -- that Building #4 was really oceanfront, and asked to be moved there. Wow, what a difference! These rooms shouldn't even be in the same category; I can't believe they charge the same. The lanai in Bldg 4 was 2-3 times bigger than the one in Bldg 3 (and the upper floors of Bldg 3 don't really even have lanai's, just about 18 in. of decking, enough to fit just one chair, as this was the first room they put me in and it was completely unacceptable). And the rooms in Bldg 4 are truly Oceanfront. So if a lanai is important to you, be sure to ASK the hotel by calling directlly. The 800# agents have no clue. I was there during the only tsunami warning in nearly 50 years, necessitating a full evacuation of the entire Hawaiian islands' seashores. It was really something looking out at Kaaanapali beach at 11 AM on a gorgeous sunny day with absolutely no one on the beach at all. The big wave never materialized, but I was impressed that the hotel offered free lunch to all their guests as a gesture since we couldn't get out of there until the \"all clear' was sounded in early afternoon. They did seem a little shell shocked about the whole event, and I did rail on them a bit about the fact there was absolutely no information at all in the rooms about what to do -- I heard the sirens going off at 6 AM. I googled tsunami on my cell phone and called my hubby back in the states, as he knows all about these things working with the Oceanographic folks. The pool area and nearby bar are really nice, and I loved being able to swim in the \"lagoon\" type pool. The towel situation is ridiculous (towel cards, etc.), but I've found that pretty endemic throughout the hotels in Hawaii nowadays. The beach is wonderful, and I can echo other posters about the quality of snorkeling, including seeing several turtles very close to shore. I've snorkeled in many places in the world, and this was definitely very nice, considering I could just walk out of my room and onto the beach -- and there I was! Be sure to bring your own snorkeling gear if you can. If you're staying 5-7 days or more, it's worth it to buy your own. The double, canopied cabana that you can rent for $40 is truly decadent. Skip breakfast at the hotel; it's ridiculously expensive and about a C+ in quality. A quick shuttle ride/drive/walk to Duke's north of the property about 3/4 mile is well worth it. There are other breakfast options nearby as well. Re: drinks, I also brought my own rum -- Maui brand rum is great -- and mixed it with my own purchased mixers like passion/guava juice. Do this and you'll save a bundle on drinks from the bar. Eating recommendations nearby: Try Kimo's in Lahaina, Roy's in Kahana, Lelani's in Whaler's Village just a short walk away for dinner. And then there's the wonderful Duke's too, part of the same \"network\" as these other restaurants. I think the trend towards resort fees is insane. Their $25 + tax a day bought only parking and wireless internet access. Who needs the internet when you want to escape????? BTW, they do have computers you can use for free next to the bar downstairs. I finally discovered them on the last day. There's nothing that tells you in their literature that they're there. All in all, I would return here, but I would be very hard-nosed about where they put me on the property. The staff is friendly if not overly efficient, and seemed to bend over backwards to make it a pleasant stay for me.

The rooms at the Sheraton are nice, comfortable bed, nice flatscreen t.v. and balcony. The pool was really nice and big. However, we spent most of our time on the beach. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants due to the price. We went down to Whalers Village which was only about a 10 min. walk where the prices were much cheaper. The resort fee is was a complete rip off, essentially we paid $26 a day to park, for the fitness center, and for towel service. We knew the fee before booking the hotel, so we really couldn't complain. Town of Lahaina has lots of great restaraunts and shopping so we spent a lot of evenings there. Highly recommend renting a car to tour the island.My husband and I got married in Maui and we went back for our 5 year anniversary. We got married on a beach called the Secret Cove or Wedding Cove. A great little secluded beach to visit and right next to Makenna beach which are both absolutely beautiful! Recommend hitting the local Walmart which is near the airport to load up on beer and snacks. We saved a lot of money by buying our own beer and wine and bringing with in insulated mugs on the beach. We also bought a cabana to use on the beach. Saved us $40 a day as that was the price for renting a cabana and/or chairs and umbrella. We were able to bring home the cabana as it was in a compact portable bag, so we can use it on future trips. Some of our favorite restaraunts included: Mama's Fish House, Kimos, Tijuana, and Bubba Gumps. Site seeing: Road to Hana is amazing! Absolutely beautiful green foliage and an adventure like no other!

We arrived just as it was getting dark outside. We rented a car and check in was very easy and were greeted with a shell lei. We stayed in the building on top of black rock. We arrived to our room and were somewhat disappointed with the view as our balcony actually was on ground level and a small fence partially blocked our view. We called the front desk and asked if we could be moved to something a floor or two up and they were very helpful and we were moved to another room the next day. We would have stayed in that room as being able to walk out onto the small bit of grass from your balcony was great but we wanted a bit more privacy considering it was our honeymoon. The views from both rooms were breathtaking. The only downside to that area was that it did take two elevators and a few minutes of walking to get down to the beach. It was well worth it though as it was quiet the entire time. The food was excellent and drinks were amazing. Food and drinks were slightly expensive but to be expected at a hotel/resort. Those saying too expensive obviously do not travel very often. I did find though that if you have a drink made you can have the drink topped off with a shot of 151 for cheap.... more booze for the buck. You have to do breakfast at least once as it was spectacular. One tip on breakfast is that there was a coffee stand that opened up in the morning right next to the lobby that served breakfast sandwiches that were cheap and amazing. The lion coffee was outstanding too. The beach was more then we could have asked for. My wife enjoyed the beach and sun from the two person lounge chair with shades. I enjoyed snorkeling around black rock and rented the snorkeling gear right next to the pool. When renting the snorkeling gear I was given the sales pitch for the dinner/sunset catamaran cruise. We decided to do it and it really wasn't too bad price wise considering food and drinks were included. We walked down to where you are picked up by the boat. It was spectacular. It is certainly a must do. Tip.... it was windy and you should plan accordingly. Make sure to bring camera/camcorder as you will capture some amazing pictures. The grounds were well kept and rooms were very clean. The staff was very helpful and nice. The cliff diving from black rock was a blast to watch. We finished our honeymoon by staying in waikiki at the Hilton. Here is a small comparison of the two. Waikiki also had amazing views and slightly cheaper rates. The difference was the service and atmosphere. We were glad to stay in waikiki as we got to do some of the usual touristy things.... but whenever we return to hawaii we will be staying at the Sheraton Maui. We told both hotels that it was our honeymoon and we received a bottle of champagne at the sheraton and at the hilton in waikiki we were told.... we dont offer anything special anymore for honeymoons. Waikiki was crowded and touristy while sheraton maui was incredibly relaxing and we never felt crowded during our entire stay.

The hotel is beautiful and, in my opinion, situated in the best location in Kaanapali. It's located right at Black Rock which has excellent snorkeling and a very nice beach. And the hotel is just a 10-minute walk along the boardwalk to the Whaler's Village mall, with its shops and restaurants. And because of Black Rock, there are not a lot of tourists and shoppers walking by and through the property at most hours of the day (unlike the Westin, for example, which is located next door to the mall). The grounds are maintained very well, and the pool areas are accommodating and clean. The fitness center was modern and more than adequate, and luau was fantastic! I also got a massage at one of the poolside/beachside cabanas (as opposed to one inside the spa), and it was very well done and relaxing--with the sounds of birds, waves crashing, and the wind blowing. And we have no complaints about the friendly staff. For these reasons, I would recommend this hotel, particularly for a couple celebrating a romantic occasion (as we were). However, we did have a few issues with certain aspects of the hotel, and that kept me from giving it 5 out of 5 stars. First, if you do stay there, avoid the breakfast. It's over-priced and the buffet selection is very limited (probably less than a third of the items offered by Starwood's signature hotel in Vegas, Planet Hollywood). The most disappointing part of the buffet was the \"freshly squeezed juice\", as it said on the menu and was reinforced by our waiter: it was definitely not freshly squeezed, and it was pretty bad! A few other issues that bothered us: one of the pool bars closed daily at 3pm, even if it was still crowded with guests lounging by the pool. Even the waitress who was serving us didn't understand management's decision there. (We could still walk over to the other pool bar to get a drink, but it was not very convenient.) The Starbucks coffee cart closed down daily at 11am; after that there was no decaf available on-site unless the restaurant was open (and it closed down between lunch & dinner). Finally, there was no business center in the hotel, so unless you bring a laptop, you won't be surfing the Internet while you're in Maui (but then again, you're in Maui, so not that big of a deal). So, there were a few minor flaws, but don't let them scare you away--the Sheraton Maui is a first-class property and definitely worthy of a stay!", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "calgary", "Title": "\u201cwow!

I was not impressed with the room or the bed and definitely not the view. Our view going into our room was of some type of plant or cleaning facility. It was an extreme eyesore. I wish I could upload the photo. (I will try to do so in the future). The balcony door could not be left open at night because the balconies were so close together that you could easy access the person's next to you by climbing over. This made me feel a little unsafe. I did not particularly care for the beach here as it is very narrow and small. I'm aware that it has won awards in the past but I did not think it was so great after seeing many other beaches in my travels. One positive is that it is close to Black Rock which does have a cliff diving service at sundown. That was cool to see. You can also jump off the rock yourself in the daytime and snorkel around the rock, which opens up to a large open area on the other side. There is no great access though and you have to swim around the rock to the other side or climb the rock yourself. Lahina was great for dining so we drove there every night for dinner. There are some very good restaurants there and we were glad that it was not a far drive to dinner. One that we hightly recommend is the Lahina Grill (pricey but worth every penny). We also were appreciative of our Concierge that helped us to book our helicopter tour and whale watching trip. She helped us to make the most of our time in Maui. Service was good from what we experienced. The gentleman that brought our luggage to the room spent about 45 minutes with us, telling us all about the hotel and the area. I must say that it gave us some great ideas on things to do and places to see, etc. This hotel prides themselves on service. The pool was as cold as ice. I did swim but I was freezing. Their snack bar outside did not open until noon which was odd since there were people out there at 8am looking to get a drink/water, etc. There were also very few chairs so I ended up on the grass near the hedges with ants all over my book.

We checked in and were given a Mountain View Room - which was an upgrade from our Garden View Room (the person we checked in with - didn't tell us, I figured that out later). We arrived pretty late and were really tired so I didn't really look at the view. Our room was standard, nothing too impressive.

We went to bed and when I woke up, I was greeted by the sun coming over the mountian and that's when I realized that despite some minor flaws, I was in Maui and was staying at a great hotel!!! And it was, the service became outstanding. Every waiter, every bartender, the help desk, room service - everyone was so welcoming. Our view ended up being amazing, and I literally watched the sunrise every morning from my balcony! Finally, our wedding day approached. (I should mention, our wedding was just the two of us). After a few minor slips with getting the marriage license, it was truly the best day of my life. The wedding planner, Michelle, was amazing, and I felt like she was a longtime friend by the end of everything. The scene was beautiful, and she helped us pick a great photographer and videographer. I could not have wished for anything else, it was the most beautiful day! We ended up having the Sheraton's 'Dinner Under the Stars' which blew our minds! The food was great, and it felt like we were the only ones on the beach. It was the most romantic dinner I will ever have, it felt better than a movie! I can truly say that because of Michelle and the Sheraton staff - I felt like a queen. We were given the royal treatment!

The grounds were taken care of, the hotel was always clean, and the pool was gorgeous! I did however (and I was glad given the nature of our stay) feel like this hotel was geared towards couples instead of families. I did not encounter many children during our stay, and I quite liked that. We didn't love the food at Keka'a, Cliff Dive etc. Strangely, it felt like cheap family dining. Not very impressive. Since I was having my hair for our wedding done at the Westin we decided to take advantage at the 'Stay at One, Dine At All' program and have lunch there before my appointment. WOW!!!! The hotel was modern and chaotic, I would've been very sad to stay there but the food was out of this world!! Tropica was like high end dining, and I thought it was strange since the Westin appeared to be more child friendly. We ended up eating at the Westin alot. So glad we were able to! (Oh! And after our wedding - our wedding planner had tucked in a card with our champagne that said 'welcome and \"here's a little taste of Maui\" to get us started'.

There was a small mixup in our room selection and they quickly ironed it out. The view from the Moana is of Molokai and this time of year you can see whales frolicking. The only minus is that the resort is a little spread out and its a bit of a maze to get from Moana to the beach and central areas. Small price to pay for the view. The beach is a little small but it wasn't crowded. A word to the wise: be very careful snorkeling out and around the Blackrock point. It is deceptively dangerous and unless you are a very strong swimmer and experienced snorkeler I would recommend a flotation device. Given that the reef is spectacular and the turtles are very used to people. The breakfast buffet and omelet bar were very nice and the buffet varied from day to day. The ocean front bar is pretty good with a great location. The on-site restaurants are passable but nothing to write home about. Skip the luau, try the traditional luau in old Lahaina instead.

Of the resorts located in Lahaina, the Sheraton has one of the best beaches. Note, not all the hotels along this beach coast actually have a large enough beach to spend the day on. It was perfect being by Black Rock. Each day,we would rent a chair (yes you have to rent them) and would spend the day snorkling. You can rent equipment daily. I suggest if you are going to snorkel most of your time there, to rent equipment elsewhere because it does it costly. We saw turtles (early morning or later afternoon), tons of fish and an occasional sting ray. The pool areas are also nice but once we discovered the beach, we spent most of our time there. At night, we would walk along the beach path and could see other hotels. About 5 minutes down the path is a small mall. Many shops and some restaurants (including McDonalds). It was enjoyable to walk this path - lots of beautiful sites. the Sheraton has a restaurant by the pools. Nothing fancy but nice. Lunch will run you about $12-$15 a person. There is also a fancy restaurant for dinner but we skipped it due to cost. The one bad thing about this hotel is the beds are extremely hard. Our backs ached by the end of the week.

We stayed in building Hale Moana in a Deluxe Ocean Front room. This building had some of the best views compared to the other 2 building choices. The Ocean Front Rooms are located on a giant volcanic rock peninsula that juts out into the water. Make sure to stay on at least floor 3 or higher for best views. The view from our room was nothing short of amazing! We could watch sea turtles swimming below and were greeted every morning by the sight of whales splashing in the distance. We noticed much more whale activity on bright sunny days. Make sure to bring your binoculars! Another bonus of the Ocean Front rooms is that you can park fairly close to the units to make walks to and from the car minimal. The room was very nicely updated and had plasma TV, refrigerator and microwave. The room was very clean and well kept up. The Ocean Front Rooms took 3 elevator rides to get to the beach but the view and privacy was well worth it! We found the food was a little on the pricey side so we ate many meals at the local CJ's Comfort Zone restaurant located just N on the main highway and brought our own soft ice chest to the beach. This hotel's common areas are designed \"open air\" so the cool \"Trade Winds\" are always pleasantly blowing through all areas. The decor of this hotel was very impressive and the staff was very attentive and friendly. This property has a paved sidewalk near the ocean we used to walk 5 minutes to the Whaler's Village Mall. The grounds of this hotel had tons of sweet smelling Plumaria and Ginger trees and were extremely well kept up. In my opinion, the beach this hotel is located on, Kaanapali Beach, is one of the best beaches on the island with regard to proximity to amenities and water/weather. The Black Rock peninsula this hotel is located on is an excellent snorkel spot with many sea turtle and fish populations in the area as well as an on-site snorkel equipment rental shop. Make sure to get your goggles sprayed with the no-fog mixture the shop has for fog free enjoyment. We really enjoyed this hotel and will be back.

We're a young couple in our late 20's and we were looking for a relaxing, serene environment. This was not the place for that, but I think we were expecting too much. The pictures are so gorgeous on the site so we thought we were set for a luxurious time. We weren't really impressed with this place. Nice staff and all that, it just was a little, run down it seemed. Let me give you an overview. I will try to be helpful. Pros: The grounds are beautiful. Free drink upon check-in. Nice beach. Gorgeous at night. Check out the torch lighting ceremony they do in the evening. Don't miss the sunset. I hear the Sheraton has a great Luau, but most tend to say the Old Lahaina Luau is the better. The staff seem to be very friendly and helpful. They were able to help me when we had our phone stolen (not on the resort). The resort feels safe, the pools are gorgeous, the best thing about this place is the grounds. Lush vegetation, flowers, very pretty place. Cons: Not worth the price. If you like the corporate/hotel feel, this place is for you. It gets crowded, as most large hotels do, but they manage to keep things relatively quiet. It's a La Quinta/Holiday Inn room. No luxury at all unless you get out your checkbook and pay top dollar for a suite. Not cozy to say the least, but it's your average hotel room, for a more than average price. It's located in Ka'anapali which isn't really close to anything grand. The airport is quite a drive away. Sure you're on a nice stretch of beach with other hotels and a golf course, but if you're looking for the nightlife, stay in Wailea or Lahaina. Everything on the resort was over the top expensive. The drinks, the phone calls. It's to be expected, just don't use the phone or do anything on the resort. Advice: Don't eat or drink anything on the resort. Too expensive. Brink snacks to the room. Go to Old Lahaina Luau. Also, downtown Lahaina is THE place for the nightlife. Bring 5 bucks for parking. Go to Moose McGillicuddy's and have a beer and get the pork tacos. Drive the Road to Hana. It's amazing. Drive up to the Haleakala crate (10000 feet up) and get a look at the world from above the clouds. That was so spectacular. The \"partial ocean view\" is very partial.

We were shown to our room by a very informative bell hop who immediately corrected an error when we arrived at our room. We were given a room with double beds instead of the king we had requested.

The oceanview was truly ocean \"view\" as you can see from my attached photos. We were in building three on the fourth floor. The service in the restaurants was pleasant and prompt, as was the poolside bar. If I had to list a negative, it would be all of the noisy children at the pool. I have children myself, but left them at home so we could relax. There were a LOT of children here! If you are planning on peace and quiet, you may want to rethink this hotel. Perhaps we were there during a busy \"child\" time. The snorkeling is fantastic right off of the beach at the hotel...we even saw several sea turtles. You could also see whales from our lanai.

My complaints with the Sheraton were all individually minor, but without anything that was truly excellent on the \"plus\" side (except arguably the location), I have to say I would not stay at this location again, especially with so many other choices on Maui. Location: The Sheraton is the \"last\" hotel in a string of hotels in the Ka'anapali beach resort. As such, it is located right next to the \"black rock\", a lava rock outcropping which juts out into the ocean. I did not do any snorkeling at the resort but supposedly this is a good area for it. You can basically walk right out of the hotel, rent some equipment on the beach, and walk right out into the ocean and snorkel, which is convenient. However, the black rock snorkel area is close to ALL the hotels in the strip - all you have do is walk 5 minutes down the paved beach path from any of the other resorts and you can take advantage of this \"amenity.\" The downside to being at the \"end of the chain\" of resorts is that at nighttime, the place is really really dead. There's nobody walking around, and nothing going on. Some might prefer the tranquility, but I like to be right in the action. For instance, on my last night there, at 9:30, I walked from my building (#3) to the front desk to print my boarding pass. I did not see ONE person for the entire trip, which was kinda creepy for a place that can accommodate this many people. Nobody in the hallways, elevators, or visible on the grounds. There wasn't even anyone at the front desk, concierge, or valet! If you want to find the action, walk up towards the \"whaler's village\" where there are a whole bunch of shops, and a couple of popular restaurants. That's where everybody seems to hang out at night since there is nothing going on at the Sheraton. Rooms: My room (partial ocean view) in building 3 and the complex overall was looking a little bit \"tired.\" I think the hotel staff is doing the best they with what they have - I saw them doing maintenance in many areas - but you can only do so much before it's time to strip it out and start over. What I mean by \"tired\" is that the carpets and paint are a bit worn, the furniture is scratched, and the tiling in the bathroom shows the age and wear of thousands of travelers. For what the Sheraton costs, I was also shocked by the small size of the room and lanai. Due to the curvature of the facade, my lanai started out about 3 feet wide on one end and curved down to 6 inches on the other. BARELY enough room for one chair. There are no desks in the room - only a rectangular table and wicker \"lounge\" type chair. This made it virtually impossible to set my laptop up in a comfortable manner. The fact is that the room is too small to accommodate a \"work\" type desk/chair and also a \"relax\" type chair, so they ditched the desk. I know you're supposed to be relaxing in Maui, but I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like a small spot to set up a computer. Another thing I found weird is that the towel rack is INSIDE the shower. Unless you take them all off the rack, dry towels on the top rack get damp while you shower, and wet towels hanging there to dry get wet all over again. Dumb. Bedding: The mattress was not the best nor the worst hotel bed I've ever slept on. My biggest complaint is that there was NO SHEET. Yes, the only thing they give you is a big fluffy down comforter with a sheet duvet cover attached to it. This makes no sense to me! Maybe the hotel management didn't notice but Hawaii is TROPICAL. Your choice is to therefore sleep on the bed with nothing whatsoever covering you, or swelter under the huge comforter. Even with the A/C cranked up to the max, the comforter was too hot and I my wife and I cursed it every night. Food: The hotel has one dining area. During the day it is the breakfast buffet, and at night it automagically becomes the Black Rock Steak and Seafood \"fine dining\" restaurant with the switching of menus - I will review the restaurant separately on tripadvisor. As part of my vacation package, I got free breakfast coupons for the buffet every day. The only thing good I can say about the breakfast buffet is that once you sat down to eat the view was nice. But the buffet itself was only worth it if it was free. The scrambled eggs were runny, the has browns greasy, all the \"hot\" food was cold, and there was nobody minding the buffet at all times to replace food which had run out. I ate there twice and only because it was free with my package. The rest of the days the thought of going down there in the morning to eat kind of repulsed me and I skipped the breakfast. If it's free, the breakfast might be OK for a family who doesn't want to leave the hotel and if the kids are bugging you to eat before swimming, but in summary, skip the hotel restaurants entirely if you are a food snob like I am. Exterior: The Sheraton resort is huge and sprawling. I think there are at least 8 buildings, and I may not have even seen them all. It takes some time to wander all the way through it, and to learn where things are. The exterior of the building is well maintained and architecturally interesting, and the grounds themselves are immaculate and lit by gas tiki torches at night. They have a great pool system, with various meandering \"branches\" of the pool that wind around, go under bridges, and meet up with small grottos. Kids seemed to be having a blast swimming around and exploring the pool complex. Staff: I had very little interaction with the staff after check-in, but my interactions were pleasant.

Parking was always plentiful, there were tons of space. The Starbucks cart is only open around breakfast time and charges $4 or $5 for a venti regular brewed coffee.

There's Leilani's on the beach and Hula, 2 great places to eat there. The pool chairs were a bit hard to find because people reserved chairs w/ their towels (they were sometimes gone for a really long time), but by mid to late afternoon when we got back we could find 2 chairs next to each other. The beach was nice but it shrunk during the week because of strong waves every day. We rented chairs for $10/day, the umbrella was $20/day...expensive and annoying to pay for, but I like being on chairs so suckers like me pay for these things! Oh there's no beach alcohol / food service, but there's 2 bars on opposite ends by the pools. And...the waves were fun if you could swim and snorkeling was nice!! but if you're there, be careful if you snorkel where the teens jump off from blackrock...one of them landed on a snorkeler and there was a lot of yelling and fighting after that.

We'd return, but even though we got a good discount off the rack rate, I'd compare other properties along Kanapali Beach if we want to be in this area again. Room #4308 is an ocean front room with a gorgeous view up the beach. King bed; lainai; spotless housekeeping; nice shampoo/conditioner/lotion toiletries (we didn't get shower gel until the 4th night of our stay.) It was a walk from the lobby and parking lot, but it's hard to compain when walking by beautiful bouganvillia and birds. -- we didn't mind. They try to do a good job of managing the property. While the hotel was not that crowded during our stay, they do a good job of helping mind the manners of pool goers, i.e. if you are not at your towels for a while, they will clean them up and let otehrs have the chiars. This also prevents the selfish couples who claim six chairs for different times of day. There is a pool towel check-out procedure that helps and is not onerous. While more expensive hotels manage this whole thing differently, they are also twice the price here. We liked the walking path up the beach that allows you to explore both the beach and other hotels, dining spots, etc. The location at Black Rock was wonderful both for snorkeling, and providing a small area where the surf was not as rough as some parts of the beach at this time of year. Of course, there was lots of other resort stuff going on - tiki bars, cliff diver, water sports (for a fee,) concierge, etc. Of course, my main criticism is the unethical practice of the mandatory resort fee. This should always be built into the price of the room. It's nice when it includes things like free parking and local call, but truly annoying when they still nickel-and-dime you -- or more like $20 a day -- for a beach umbrella. Also: the internet access is relatively slow, and should be included in the room rate anyway. The breakfast was expensive and only okay, but the setting is nice. We found other spots in Kapalua and nearby areas on other mornings. Not sure what to make of it: while we were a bit early for check-in, they asked if we wanted an upgrade. It seemed that they were not well-trained in this -- upgrade to WHAT? Is this a guessing game? We have an ocean-front room -- what is better? Free breakfast? Suite? Do I have to beg for details? We kept our room and were very happy -- and it seemed ready quite soon. So -- nice stay, but there are other good properties on Maui.

After my summer Hawaii trip, I thought I would start. And I would start with this hotel. I have always believed that if you wanted to, you could find something to complain about with anything, so I usually like to give the good with the bad. First the good. What an amazing location. You are right on black rock, and the beach is right there. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great. Just a quick swim to amazing views swimming around black rock. There is a small walking trail that goes all the way up the beach, to the shops and everything. Its nice being able to just walk down there and not have to drive the car, find a spot to park, ect ect. The location is good. I stayed in building 6, deluxe ocean FRONT (yes there is a difference between ocean view and front). The view was amazing! What a great room and a great location. The room was big for being a non-suite, and I loved the balcony right there on black rock. Downside to building 6 is you have to walk to get places. But unless you have a serious problem with your health and need a little kart to drive u around, you should be fine. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not as bad as people say. The Bad: Just remember when you book this place they charge you a $26+ fee everyday for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153internet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153parking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yoga\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and stuff like that. Well I saw the yoga and 4 people were doing it. Basically this is additional profit hidden as an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153amenity fee\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is crazy!!! It is way too high. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t realize how much of a sham it was until I was there. The internet in my room ran at about 5-10 kb/sec. Just a tad higher than dialup. No high speed at all. Parking, well let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just say if you are in building 6 (which has its own parking lot) and you get home around 11pm+, good luck finding a spot. Many people had to illegally park. I just kept parking in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel cart only\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd parking. Figured if they wanted me somewhere else they would build a space for me. Also they have this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick check in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where you pretty much get whisked right to your room. Ok in theory, but then they call you telling you to give them a credit card number for \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incidentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incidentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I am on vacation and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the need to walk to the lobby and give them my card for something I will never use. Hotel stuff is priced way to high. If they needed the card, they would have gotten in when I checked in. Well about day 3 into my trip, and I am in the shower and I hear my door open (I had the chain up).. I came to the door and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the front desk coming into my room to find out why I haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t given them a card number? Also they disarmed my door key so my door wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open? I was furious. I asked the manager of the front desk, who was the same young lady who came into my room, why she did it. She said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153to check on you to make sure you were ok because you never gave us your credit card for incidentals\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ask housekeeping. If I am dead I think they would know about it, they are in here every day.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she was sorry, but I would no longer be allowed in my room until I gave her a credit card number. She said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the computer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I hate this cop out) I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153you programmed the computer to do that, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t blame it.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said she was sorry and that was it.

However earlier this year (way back in March) I got a starwood email with a half-price deal and decided to go for it - I booked a room for $299 a night for the first week of my holiday, and decided to move back to the KBH for the second week. I had a room in building 3, on the 5th floor, with a fabulous view of the other side of Kaanapali beach - I have never been over there, but it made for some great photos. The room itself was small and fairly basic, but it did have a fridge (no mini-bar) and one of those huge flat screen televisions and the standard comfy sheraton bed. it was very small - I had to move one of the chairs over to in front of the faux-balcony to make room for the suitcase stand (I live out of my suitcase, I don't unpack fully), but it was ok. The bathroom was likewise very small, but totally serviceable. The positives: the grounds really are fantastic, the lagoon pool is so much fun, the big fixed umbrellas are perfect for keeping you out of the sun, and the service out by the pool is friendly, attentive and professional. I really had a very relaxing week. I also appreciated the shuttle which takes guests into Lahaina, and the fact that the resort fee includes local phone calls and 0800 numbers and the internet. The not-so-positives: I felt a bit like a second class citizen: the woman at reception made a bit of a deal about my cheap rate which I thought was kind of odd, and on christmas eve when room service went room to room dropping off boxes of chocolates and bubbly as gifts from the hotel, i was conspicuously missed out which i thought was kind of mean. On the day I checked out when I asked if a late check out would be possible (I am a starwood member and usually this is no big deal), the receptionist told me that with my rate it wouldn't be possible (she said it very nicely and the rules are the rules but still, it made me feel a bit second class). The resort fee ($26.95 plus tax) is ridiculously high - who can use that much internet or local calls in a day? When added to the taxes, it added an extra $70 to my $299 rate - that is a pretty big extra whack. I had room service one night and ate lunch at the pool bars each day - the food was perfectly acceptable; it was much better value at the bars than in the hotel itself. I have now moved next door the KBH which has had a make over since the last time I was here - my room here is much nicer than my sheraton room, and the staff are just that bit friendlier but there is no denying that Sheraton has the nicer grounds.

Since Black Rock is in front of Sheraton, you don't need to go any farther for the snorkeling, rent the gear or bring your own, snorkel right in front of the hotel (save some $$ for snorkel); every evening, there's divers diving at the black rock.

The staff were very friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Checking-in and -out were both easy. We self-parked our rental car and there was always more than enough space. We loved the open grounds of this hotel. It's spacious and calm, with lots of trees, but not overbuilt with huge waterfalls, slides, and shops like some of the others are. They didn't have Hawaiian music at the evening bar (it was jazz & \"easy listening\"), so we went next door to the Ka'anapali Beach Hotel for Hawaiian music and hula each night. The beach is great, though surf was a bit high for a few days. Snorkeling at Black Rock was OK, but because of the higher surf activity the water was a bit cloudy. We saw fish, big turtles and a manta ray. I highly recommend this hotel. This was our 15th trip to the islands.

Restaurants: Black Rock: excellent food and service Spa: Had 2 facials and a massage there - excellent therapists....my wife said that it was the best massage she'd ever had.....and she's had a lot! Couple of tips: - Don't rent the cabanas on the beach - overpriced and we were comfortable laying out on our towels. - Be sure to stock up on extra food from the supermarket. Found the best deals for gifts (Coffee and macadamia nuts etc. at the local Longs Drugstore). - Be sure to try Bikini Blonde beer - our favorite for the week. - Do not use the valet service for parking.

This was by far one of the best trips that I have been on. Upon arrival we were told we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean Front in Bldg 2, but turned it down because it was two double beds. Our orginal booking of a Ocean View room in Bldg 4 actaully turned out to be a better view. We were on the 6th floor which gave a great view of the mountains and the beach/ocean. The room was clean and updated and the provided complementary champange. For the amount of time that we spent in the room it was perfect. The food was a little pricey, but worth it. We had Breakfast included in our package which I would recommend. It was nice to be able to get up and not have to think about where to eat. You also have the option of eating at the Westin since it is a sister property. The Breakfast buffet had different items each day, the fresh fruit was probably the best part. The Westin had a comparable breakfast option but a little more variety. We also ate one night at the Steak and Seafood restaurant on site. The food was excellent. There are plenty of options for food in all price ranges if you do a little research. The poolside food was probably the only thing where I felt was too pricey for what you got. After we discovered this we resorted to the Safeway grocery store and made our lunch. We used the pool and beach services each day. The pool is crowded and you have to get there early for a chair, but the staff was on top of moving towels is people didn't show up after a while. The beach rentals for the cabanas were 40 per day, but they also had the option of just lunge chairs for 20 dollars. We rented lounge chairs a couple times and it was worth it because the wind really kicks up the sand. The staff at the hotel was extremely friendly and the concierege was probably the most helpful. She made lots of recommendations for activities outside of the hotel and it all turned out to be a great experience. Housekeeping came in everyday and cleaned. A nice feature they offer is to forego housekeeping for a day and you recieve a $25 credit towards dinner at the restaurant.

The pool is very large, with a fun slide and waterfall, it is very refreshing after a few hours in the saltwater. There was some discussion amongst our group about the pool closing so early. It does close at 8:00pm and the hot-tub closes at 10:00pm. I think this is to do with maintaining the calm and peaceful atmosphere. The pool bar (The Lagoon Bar) closes at 8:00pm also. So if you are in the hot-tub you do have to go into the main bar to get drinks. (I wore a nice cover-up and it was no problem).

If you had asked me what I'd rate this hotel on our first night, I would have said zero stars out of five. We had a BIG problem at check-in. We were supposed to stay at this hotel from October 31 through November 7. However, I came down with the flu a couple of days before the departure, and we had no choice but to push the trip back a week. We had booked a package deal (airfare and hotel) through one of the big travel websites. Anyway, the travel website took care of rebooking everything for us. When we arrived at the Sheraton at 10:30pm (which to us felt like 3:30AM since we were coming from the east coast), they had NO record of our reservation. None. Our first reaction was to be furious with the travel website, we figured they had messed up and had not changed the reservation with the Sheraton. We sat there for 30+ minutes while the front desk and the night manager tried to figure everything out. I just sat in the lobby on a chair and cried. I was EXHAUSTED, and after almost 17 hours of travel, 10 of which were on the plane, I was ready for my room, a shower, and a warm bed. FINALLY, they figure out what went on - we were informed that big travel website.com HAD indeed called Sheraton to change (NOT cancel) our reservation, and someone in the \"back room\" had taken the call and didnt make the change. OMG!!!! For them to even tell us this blew me away. They put us in the crappiest, tiniest temporary room with two double beds, a shower with absolutely no water pressure, and a view of the parking lot. But, I didnt care, I cleaned up and fell into the bed. The next day, they checked us into the room we HAD originally booked, which was in building 6, with beautiful ocean views. Yes, Building 6 is a pain the neck to get to from the pool/beach/lobby area, but we liked our room so it didnt matter. Over the next 6 days, we thoroughly enjoyed the staff (so many \"alohas\" as we passed through the hallways), our room was taken care of VERY efficiently each day, it was always clean and fully stocked with toiletries and necessities when we returned from our excursions. The breakfast buffet was fantastic, lots of yummy selections. We never waited more than 10-15 minutes to be seated. The beach and pool areas were AMAZING, and we LOVED snorkeling at Black Rock. We saw so many neat fish and SEA TURTLES!!! The hotel itself is aging, yes, my mother stayed there in 1971, but the grounds are incredible. The other hotels in the same strip, except for the Westin, didnt look nearly as nice. Whalers Village was a nice walk, we ate at the Hula Grill one evening but were not blown away by the food. There's an ABC store there ( ;) ) and some nice stores. There is a shuttle that runs from Sheraton to Whalers/Westin, and Lahaina. We took advantage of the shuttle twice - once to go into Lahaina for dinner, and another time to go into Lahaina for the Old Lahaina Luau (highly recommend!). Sheraton really had to work hard to win me over after the glitch with our room that first night, but they did a great job in doing so ;) By the end of our week, I did not want to leave.

Everything worked great in the room, never had a problem. Water temp. and shower pressure great. Only complaint with rooms was they could have done with a little color, everything was painted white. Pool & Beach: Great, both very clean. Snorkling amazing around Black Rock. Saw giant sea turtles everyday.

My husband and I definitely preferred the 100% ocean view with the 2 breezeway and 2 elevator trek to the pool. We could see Lanai and Moloaki islands from our balcony and watched the snorklers at Black Rock every morning from our balcony. No kids in Bulding 6 as well. Mostly all honeymooners and couples. Another choice we definitely prefer! I would stay on the higher floors in Building 6. I would not have liked the bottom floor if we got that. Sheraton is very accommodating. They have no problem changing your room. If you want to be close to the pool, don't book by views. Ocean Front is going to be Building 6. We loved the pool as well. We were there off peak in October so didn't run into problems with too many kids in pool. As far as restuarants at Sheraton being expensive - well obviously! You are in Hawaii at a resort. There are plenty of less expensive choices off the hotel site. But you are still going to pay more than you would at home so don't expect a $7.00 burger and fries.

Don't expect them to know route numbers. They only know names of roads. We printed directions from the hotel's computer to get where we wanted to go. Will definitely stay again! P.S.

We almost moved to a family OHANA suite (cuz we had a 5 yr. old and 12 yr. old with us), but the view from Building 6 makes in-the-room time very enjoyable. The OHANA (family) suites are nearer to the pool and beach, but their view is not comparable to Building 6 (however B6 is a bit of a walk to beach and pool -- about 3.5 mins.); most are on first or second floor and you look at lawns or part of the beach. We did think long about moving to an OHANA though; ultimately did not ($200 more a night too). The pool is not overrun with kids --- to our dismay really-- and the beach seemed pretty kidless too. We sorta knew this before getting to Sheraton Maui, but couldn't really believe the lack of kids. WE play with our kids a lot so it wasn't a big deal, but if you want your kids to make fast friends at pool or beach I doubt Sheraton is the place for you. I played football with my son on the fabulous lawns and tennis on the courts for $13.00. We had a good breakfast every day (kids free, but adults super high $27 or so). You quickly start to see people over and over again and some waiters are very good at treating you like a good client; while others are sorta burnt out in my opinion. Overall very good and as far as I can tell the Sheraton is definitely the best layout and best looking hotel/spa in the Kannapali area. Close to everything too -- Lanahai (you must go here, we did about 5 times -- much better than Whalers village (up-scale shopping mall that lacks the small townhishness of Lanahai (sp?)) I would like to write more, but will end with saying you should really study the map of the resort (in-the-room time happens more than you think) and figure out if you want to look only over the ocean, pool, pool&ocean, nice lawns. Building 5 has some really good pool/ocean combos. Building 6 is all ocean.

The Sheraton is a beautiful resort and they try (and succeed) at making it as good for you as they can. It is a large resort and it takes up a lot of land, so everything will be a small walk, but it's really no big deal. We stayed in building 6, so being there situated directly on the top of black rock is where you have the most distance to cover, but it is still no big deal. Really! The rooms are very well laid out, better than most your going to see. I wanted to make sure building 6 was THE best choice to stay at, so on my second day there they allowed me to inspect ocean viewing rooms in buildings 2, 3, and 4. Building 2: nice rooms, but the view is of a big boring grassy area, farthest from the beach. Building 3 was nice, looking at the ocean and nice rooms too. I liked building 4 as those rooms are angled to face the ocean, but my wife wanted building 6. They had the largest rooms of them all, and they all face directly at the ocean with a spectacular view! Later on during our stay, we walked down to the Kaanapali Beach Hotel to scope it out. My wife described it perfect as \" the best Best Western you could find\". Old buildings, run down, small rooms, broken elevator. The pool was probably special back in the 60's, but it's now outdone by most hotel chains today. NO bathrooms near the pool. If you didn't know where you were, you'd swear you were in a old Best Western. Kaanapali beach is the best and biggest beach on the island. Plenty of beach sand and room so your not so crowded. ALL the other guests in the hotels along this beach have to walk down to black rock to get GREAT snorkeling at Black Rock. You at the Sheraton have it outside your door, any day you want it. The pool at the Sheraton is nice, clean, and expansive. No kiddy slides, designed for adults (most of the pool and it's walking tributaries are 5 feet deep) If I had any complaint about this resort, it would be there is not enough shade around the pools. I called it the \"quest for shade\". You had to wait until someone left for the day and take over their spot in the shade under the pool umbrella they occupied. They could use way more shade since most of us staying there are not from Maui and need to get used to the intense sun gradually. Our booking included their buffet breakfast with the room. We thought the breakfast was absolutely awesome. The variety was great, the quality was great, and a chef prepared eggs anyway you wanted 'em. You can't go wrong. We ate such a big breakfast each day, we completely ignored having lunch, which also made dinner our only paying meal of the day. Sweeeeet. Do not second guess the choice to stay here. You will not be disappointed. Any of these top notch resorts are going to be pricey on this beach, so you may as well stay at the best one. People will have a bad experience with any resort, and they will write about it here, but you'll see bad write-ups no matter which resort you research. The Sheraton has only a few bad compared to how many great write-ups for a reason.", "Date": "October 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location - Great Property\u201d", "Author": "woodchips75", "ReviewID": "UR46422372", "Content": "We were traveling on our honeymoon and stayed 10 nights at the Sheraton. The property is very nice with a great pool AND beach (it seems many properties have one or the other that is solid). The beach in front of the hotel is very popular but traveling late Sept/early Oct we probably weren't seeing it as crowded as it could be. The rooms are dated but clean (we were in bldg 3 - probably the most central location). The shower is hot with good water pressure. The staff is very friendly and helpful, particularly those who greeted us upon arrival, the waitstaff at the pool bars, the pool concierge group, and housekeeping. The $25 resort fee includes (non-valet) parking which is why I didn't classify the parking as 'free'. We were a little disappointed the rooms did not have wireless (it was only available in the lobby and restaurants). We did not have a computer but did have our iTouch and it would have been nice to have wireless in the room to look up restaurants, directions, etc. We were able to use the computers in the bar area on the first floor as needed. Kaanapali Beach is beautiful, clean and directly in front of the Sheraton. During the day, you will want to seek the comfort of shade so treat yourself to a beach cabana. Pricey? Oh yeah - but its practically a requirement unless you are used to the hot sun. If you are a pool person you have to get up early to get a shady spot. There are plenty of signs saying the pool chairs are for 'active use only' but we did not see this enforced and just like other resorts you've got those folks who go stake their claim then go back later. Yet ironically if you paid $40 for a beach cabana you had to be sure not to leave it for more then an hour, or it might get taken away on you. For a resort of the Sheraton's size, we found the fitness room to be disappointing. There were 3 elipticals, 1 of which was out of order, and despite the fact we were in there early, we found those machines almost always in use, as well as the bikes and treadmills. For a resort this size they probably needed double the space/machines. Lastly, we're self-proclaimed foodies and found the onsite dining to be a little disappointing. There are tons of great dining options off property and even within walking distances, so get out there and explore. The food wasn't bad -- don't get me wrong. Just not as good as it should have been for the price. Property Pros: Location Beach/Snorkeling Pool Friendly Staff On-site spa Cons: Restaurants No Wireless in rooms Fitness Room 'Multiple Reservations' (read below) Multiple Reservations: like many Starwood members probably do, we booked with points and paid for a couple of nights when we made our reservation. Well in their system this gets logged as two reservations. Despite multiple confirmations of our check-out date and length of stay with several individuals, the day our 'first' reservation came to a close we found our room keys deactivated. You might not think its a big deal but because we made sure many times to confirm our travel plans we found it really frustrating. As a Starwood member I urge them to synch up with their properties and address this. While reservations booked with a combination of points and cash may be documented in your systems as two reservations, to the customer we booked one reservation, and its a poor excuse when you are standing there at the end of the beach day and locked out of your room that the reason is you had two reservations. Not the customer's problem. Sounds like it may not be a unique issue to this property, so consider it more an open comment to Starwood. Other comments about Maui: Hana -- hmmm...we felt it was a little overrated for a full day commitment. However, the saving grace was that circling around the back of Haleakala (as opposed to doubling back on the Hana Hwy) made it all worth while. In our opinion, that is where the views were the best - yet, hardly any takers. It was gorgeous. You CAN drive the unpaved road as seen on the map but just be careful and be sure you do it by light of day. Surfing -- it's Hawaii - you should try it. Goofy Foot Surf School in Lahaina was terrific. We loved our instructors (Mark and John!) and think everyone should take a few hours of their trip for this. My husband knows how to surf so for him it was just a great opportunity to get out there and enjoy the waves. For me it was a first, and I was thrilled to be able to catch a few waves. Pay the extra for the photos unless you have someone onshore with a good zoom taking pics for you. Snorkeling -- we did our trip with the crew of the Teralani who were terrific (Budd, Linda and Keri) but there are tons of boats who do trips. A snorkeling trip is fun because you get to enjoy Maui by water, they provide food (many are 5 hr trips that include some breakfast and a lunch), and they can read the conditions and take you to the best place for the day. That said you should also explore other sites by land. Black Rock is great so being at the Sheraton and having that right outside your door is a treat. We saw turtles, rays, and tons of tropical fish. Dining -- best restaurant ever is Lahania Grill. The menu and wine selection were terrific. My husband had a veal chop and I had the osso bucco and we barely spoke during the meal except to express our love of the food and wine. Other notable choices: Pacific'O, Spago, Tropica (at the Westin) and Kimo's. Spa -- the Heavenly Spa at the Westin is just that - heavenly. If you really want to treat yourself you have to try it. Go early or stay after your appt to take advantage of their steam room, sauna, whirlpool, and showers. The Sheraton has a very nice spa so maybe for a manicure/pedicure, or if you just can't be bothered with the 10 min walk to the Westin, it's a very nice option. It's just not as plush as the Westin. Luau -- Old Lahaina Luau is terrific and probably the most friendly staff we've ever encountered. Great sunset pics, nice buffet and very talented entertainers. Try traditional mat seating (unless you have a bad back -- can get tiring). We wish we had more time to explore and hope we'll have an opportunity to return.

We booked through Costco and got a great deal. Upgraded to a deluxe ocean front room which was well worth the extra tarrif. The deluxe ocean front rooms are in building six which sits right on top of Black Rock. We were on the fourth floor (room #6526) which sits about 60' from the edge of the cliffs north of black rock. What a great view. We could see both Molakai and Lani. We could see turtles swimming from our balcony and the sunset slightly to the southwest. We were disappointed that we couldn't see the torch lighting ceremony from our building however. I would also recommend building #3 which also has ocean views but set much further back from the shore with the view being mostly of the strip of hotels. Check the prices on both buildings then deciede. The only challenge with building #6 is that you have to take three elevators to get to the beach, lobby or restaurants. It's bit of a trek ,but you will need to walk off your meals any ways. With the Costco package we received the daily buffet breakfast which left a lot to be desired when comared to the buffet at the Hyatt. Service was marginal, the staff didn't seem to be very happy or excited to be employed. We also recieved a $100 dining credit at the Black Rock restaurant on property. Unless you get the complementry credit as part of your package skip this restaurant as it is over priced and the food is unexciting. Eat at one of the nicer restaurants in town. The room itself wasn't bad, like most rooms in Hawaii you are paying for the location. The bed was extremely firm and the wicker chairs were not comfortable but the decor was pleasing. We snorkeled at several locations only to find that the best snorkeling was right out our back door at Black Rock. We saw and swam with multiple turtles all but one day. They must have taken that day off. I would deffinately stay here again but for a few more dollars the Hyatt is a nicer property. The pool on site is much more extensive the the web site shows.

Brought me regular pillow so had to call again (not a big deal). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Smokers on balcony a few times. Complained once and was told they would send a security person out. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if they followed up or not. Saw several people smoking on their balcony (but I was walking by, not sitting on my balcony) so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complain. For the most part, people were good about not smoking. Only saw 2 people at pool. Occasionally, someone would walk through w/ a cigarette.

Westin has much better bkfast for only $1 more (if not incl in your room rate). Still it was $26.95 pp. Better eat a lot. This is fairly typical of Hawaii hotels.

We thought we could share it since we had such a big bkfast. Big mistake \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was tiny and barely had any meat on it. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Even though hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t crowded, pool chairs in the shade went very fast and VERY early in the morning. Some people would just put a towel down and disappear for hours. Pool staff never removed any possessions as their policy indicates. As a consequence, we would have to get up early too to snag one in the shade. Plenty of loungers in the sun at all times. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Only had 3 cabanas to rent (wanted shade). $75 for day was reasonable but they were in terrible locations. One faced the pool, not the beach and was right next to the massage table. It was a very busy area. The other 2 were right in front of the beach path so people walked by all day long. Plus they were close to the smoking section and the wind always blew the smoke towards the cabanas. Here are my impressions: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Love the no smoking policy (see above). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Nice check in service.

Very nice guy. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Housekeeping staff was very nice. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 We had no problems w/ the front desk staff. Only interacted w/ them a few times and they were always helpful. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 So many fabulous restaurants in Lahaina and Kapalua that we never ate dinner at the hotel. We bought some lunch stuff (fried chicken, lunch meat, etc.) and had lunch in our room on the days we stayed at the pool/beach. Much better than eating at the pool. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Pool waitresses were very friendly. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t nag you all the time if you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t drinking \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Wonderful snorkeling right along black rock. Unfortunately a 43 year old man drowned there on our first day. Seeing him dragged out of the water (dead) wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a view I want to remember. It was an awful sight. So please, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t snorkel alone! \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Building 1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c believe this is all family suites. Interior corridors. Close to pool, garage and lobby. Only 2 floors and set back in front of large lawn so even though all rooms face the ocean, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a great view. Very few rooms in this bldg. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Building 2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5 floors all facing ocean. Exterior corridors. Bldg is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153L\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shaped. Large lawn in front of building. Very close to garage (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience any noise from it though). Excellent ocean views from upper floors. Balconies do get a bit smaller as you go up the bldg, but our room was on the 4th floor and I thought the balcony was adequate. 2 chairs and table (no lounger). We couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sit out there during day since our unit was in the sun and way too hot. Rooms on the other side of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153L\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd had some shade and looked delightful. But you would have to look sideways to see the best ocean view. So it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a toss up. Looked like there were a few suites in the middle of the bldg. All rooms are considered Deluxe Ocean View. Bathroom had tub/shower combo, 2 sinks, separate toilet area w/ door. Fairly open floor space so we could both use bathroom at same time. Limited storage space \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no under sink cabinets or drawers. We had mini fridge which was handy for snacks and lunch stuff. No micro but was told we could have requested one. Plenty of closet space w/ safe and iron. 2 wicker chairs and table in room. Large LCD TV. Plenty of drawers in dresser. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bldg 3 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c This bldg faced the pool/ocean on 1 side and mountains/pking lot on the other. Interior corridors. We had a day room in this bldg on our last day. Rooms are considerably smaller than Bldg 2. Only a single sink in bathroom and no separate area for toilet. So only 1 person could really use bathroom at once. Believe rooms would be considered garden view, terrace view and ocean view. Some rooms are pretty far from pking garage. Balconies get MUCH smaller as you go up. Some looked barely useable. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bldg 4 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c fabulous views of pool and ocean. This bldg is closest to pool (right over it). Spa is located on ground floor. Some interior, some exterior corridors (depends on which floor you are on). Think it was 5-7 floors tall. Built right up against Black Rock. Rooms and balconies get smaller as up go higher up. Rooms are at a funny angle and are MUCH smaller than Bldg 2 and 3. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the bathrooms but believe they are like Bldg 2. The end rooms have wonderful wrap around balconies. Furthest from pking garage. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bldg 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any of the rooms here. I think they are all suites. There is a separate pking lot (outside pking only) for Bldg 5 and 6. Far from pool, but great ocean views. Gym is in this building. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Bldg 6 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Built on top of Black Rock. Furthest from pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c multiple walk-ways/elevators to get to room. Room layout similar to Bldg 2 but balconies all appear to be the same size. Grassy lawn in front of bldg and you are on top of the ocean \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the beach, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have a white water/shore-line view. I doubt you would be able to see much of the ocean from the lower floors. Believe all rooms here are Deluxe Ocean Front rooms. They were offering a promo of $150/night including $25/day resort fee, bkfast for 2, guaranteed upgrade to Bldg 6, discounts for dinner and a few other small amenities. If we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have free nights and weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upgraded to a room in Bldg 2, I would have definitely jumped on this offer. The bkfast and resort fee account for about $80 so you are really only spending $70 to get such a good room. If they still have this promo when you book (think you need to call, I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see it on-line), I would recommend booking the cheapest room (terrace view) and ask for upgrade. Not sure if it can be booked in advance or is only offered if available upon check-in.

We were able to book an ocean-front room in Building 6 - HIGHLY recommended for honeymooning couples or others who want a quiet room with a beautiful view. It was a bit of a walk from the pool/beach area, but we didn't mind at all. Buildings 5 and 6 also have their own parking lots so you don't have to hike back from parking after dinner. Room - beautiful lanai with a great view of Black Rock. Really comfy bed and plenty of space to unpack clothing. Only slight complaint was the bathroom was a bit out of date (older tub, etc.) and nowhere to store toiletry items - other than I can't complain. Meals - we had coupons for free breakfast buffet during our stay, which was great - we stuffed ourselves. I recommend trying the Westin's breakfast buffet just a couple resorts down the beach. Great coffee. Probably not worth it to pay for the buffet if you don't get it for free though - just go to the hotel restaurant or a nearby cafe for a pasty or another breakfast item instead. Didn't eat at the other hotel restaurants so can't comment on those. Pools/beach - we loved the pool and traveled during non-peak season, so it wasn't crowded at all. Just get downstairs early (8:00 a.m.) if you want a chair in the shade - otherwise you'll be in the hot sun all day. We grabbed towels to reserve chairs before breakfast. The beach is AWESOME - and the Sheraton has the best slice of Kaanapali for sure. Great snorkeling around Black Rock, even just 10 feet off the beach. Nice clean bathrooms down by the pool area, too. Spa - I only got a manicure there, so can't comment on other services. My manicurist was really friendly but I have to say the manicure wasn't the best I've had - and it was VERY pricey ($45 without tax or tip). Maybe massages or other services have better bang for the buck, though. Other comments about staying on Kaanapali/Lahaina - definitely go to the Hula Grill for lunch just down the beach. They have a new menu item, a goat cheese BLT sandwich, which I loved. Tons of other beach activities are available everywhere if you want to parasail, snorkel, surf, boogie board, etc. Also for meals outside the beach area, try Mala in Lahaina at the end of Front Street - really great burgers. Also Sansei for sushi (near the Ritz Carlton, a 10-minute drive from Sheraton).

This despite being welcomed at check-in to the news that our King size requested room wasn't available and we'd be starting our 20 year anniversary trip in two double beds. So, how did things get better...here's the list. First, they upgraded us at no charge to a partial ocean view and a room 100 square feet larger. We also had the option to move to king size room 3 days later. We decided against moving after the second night because the bedding was so comfortable and room size and location fantastic. No noise leaking from rooms next door or other floors...at all. In fact, I assumed the rooms were unoccupied and the only reason I know they weren't is that I later saw dirty plates outside the rooms awaiting pick-up. The best pillows we've ever had. Good enough that I took off the covers and checked the brand to purchase at home (Pacific Coast Feather Company). Best breakfast bar we have ever seen. Breakfast is in a beautiful open area looking out at palm trees, a koi pond, beautiful lawn area. A partial list of items available each day includes: made to order omelets, pancakes, Belgian waffles, HUGE table of the best fruit I've ever had (watermelon, pineapple, papaya, honeydo, cantelope, strawberries). Bacon (solid meat no big clumps of fat), sausage, scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, large selection of fantastic pastries whose type varied each day, breakfast items that I think were geared to Asian travelers (rice, meat items), cereal, toast and more... We saved a lot of money because our breakfast would last us until dinner, or require just a small lunch. The BEST location. The first day we went into the water I was shocked to see tropical fish swimming around my legs and I was only in about 4 feet! My husband literally ran into a sea turtle in just 3 feet of water. The amount of tropical fish around Black Rock is incredible. We did not limit ourselves to this location because we figured there had to better spots...this is too easy. Right? Wrong. We took a wonderful catamaran out to two different snorkeling areas and tried out two other beaches on our own and although we enjoyed exploring various areas, the spot right at the hotel had by far the greatest number and widest variety of sea life. I can't imagine staying anywhere else if I intended to snorkel. This is the first hotel where the provided hair dryer was good enough for me to leave mine packed. In the future, that's one less item for me to carry. It was a Conair 1875. Lots of hangers, very large closet. Plenty of light in the room. Nice flat screen TV. Separate toilet room from sink/tub/shower. Two full length mirrors inside the bathroom, facing the main bath mirror which allowed you to easily get a back-view when doing hair. (not necessary, but a nice touch) A large additional mirror in main room with electrical outlet below so I could easily do hair and make up outside the bathroom. (Also a rare option these days due to other hotels never thinking to put the bedroom mirror near an outlet.) Fridge and coffee maker in the room. We haven't used a concierge much in the past, but since we were new to Hawaii we stopped by three times and each time were provided excellent information. These folks really know the area and we saved a lot of money and frustration when they advised us to pass by one of the popular Molikini tours and go with a Teralani catamaran to different spots. We had fully intended to go to Molikini , but the concierge told us the fish population had dropped dramatically in that area and it was packed with tourists. As we stood in line to board their recommended tour of the Teralina we heard another couple talking about how they were now taking this tour because their trip to Molikini had been a complete bust the day before...NO fish and just tons of people to contend with. It had been a big waste of money. I felt quite bad for them and very grateful for the advice we had received at the Sheraton! There is free Wi-Fi throughout, but we didn't take our laptop. They also had two computers to use for free for any internet access. In addition (and this was a GREAT help!) they had a third computer and printer dedicated for guests to use to confirm flights and print out boarding passes. There was no wait to use this computer as folks weren't spending a lot of time on it for other reasons. I have never seen a hotel offer this option, I'm always stuck waiting for sometime to finish with their email. Every staff member was very polite and friendly. It was a real difference from folks we usually run into on the mainland. I know maintaining a hotel isn't easy or fun , but you wouldn't know it by the consistently friendly reception we received each time we passed a hotel employee. Thoroughly enjoyed the Luau at the hotel, paid $10 premium to get front row seating. Definitely worth it. If you want a bit more of an exciting luau, go to this one. If you want a purely traditional luau (no fire dancer), almost everyone recommends the Old Lahaina Luau. We were willing to put up with a bit of a cheesy announcer to get a more exciting show, no regrets. We never got around to getting in the pool, but it was beautiful and lots of folks were enjoying it. There were also daily activities provided, such as lei making, hula lessons, snorkeling lessons, etc. We booked through Costco which had a terrific package deal that included a $100 dinner credit for their steak house, $150 credit to use on anything at the hotel, and free breakfast each day. This was a bargain compared to package travel agent came up with or what I could put together on my own using the internet to buy separate hotel/air/car options.

The hotel is lovely, with well-kept grounds & in a prime location on Kaanapali beach. We very nearly booked our stay at the Hyatt Regency, which came highly recommended & I'm certain is very nice too, but after our pleasant stay at the Sheraton I'm glad we chose it. On our first day we took a leisurely stroll along the gorgeous mile-long beach (which I admit is probably THE nicest beach I've ever been to, with soft golden sand & not a single cigarette butt in sight!), right from our end at the Sheraton to the Hyatt Regency at the other end. I noticed that the beach area in front of the Sheraton was the widest part of Kaanapali beach, and got progressively narrower the further along we walked (hence, the beach is not very wide at the Hyatt Regency end). We had booked a garden view room via hotels.com, and despite requesting 1 king size bed, we got 2 queen size beds. Hardly ideal for honeymooners! Still, the room was nice & clean with plenty of room & a 32 inch flat wide screen high-def TV (nice!). But the room had one major flaw - we could literally hear every single word from the guests staying in the room next door. I don't know if it was due to the fact that we had a connecting door between us, or just that the walls were thin, but it was an issue for us (for anyone, I'm sure). They really need to sort this out. So, we went to the front desk & asked them politely if they had any other rooms with a king size bed. They told us that there was none available at the time, but offered to move us the next day which they did. BOY was the new room nice! It seemed they had kindly upgraded us to not only an ocean view room, but an ocean front room! And a large comfy king size bed! Plus, no noise from the neighbours! Perfect! The pool is a nice size & was never crowded during our stay. And the beach had lovely private cabanas that you could rent daily (for a fee). The snorkling by black rock was amazing, especially when a group of sea turtles came by to feed amonst the rocks, one of the best experiences ever! Every evening at sunset they have a touch lighting ceremony at black rock, which is a nice little touch. There are a couple of restaurants at the hotel that for the most part are fairly quiet. If you take a short stroll along the beach walk over to Whalers Village, it's a little more lively & have a couple of nice restaurants which are always busy (so be prepared to wait!). The shops at Whalers Village stay open fairly late, so you can always do a bit of evening shopping if you wanted to. There's also a shuttle from Whalers Village to Lahaina, which only costs $1 each way (although the last shuttle is at 9pm, so if you're out late you'll have to catch a taxi back). There's plently more choice of restaurants & shops in Lahaina, so it's worth a visit. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone, it's in a good location on the beach, is well kept, nice rooms. I'd definately go back. One thing to point out though - we took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, which cost us over $80!!! I think we were ripped off a little, coz the taxi comming back cost us $60, which is still a lot! The hotel is about 30-40 mins drive from the airport. I think there are a couple of alternative methods of transport (I think there's a shuttle bus to the hotels, but it's still something like $50), or you could rent a car (although this wasn't really an option for us as we were didn;t intend on travelling around much).", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix", "Title": "\u201cBest location in Maui\u201d", "Author": "Gibbi72", "ReviewID": "UR43981390", "Content": "My wife and I just stayed at the Sheraton during mid-September. After seeing many of the negative comments about the Sheraton, I would like to address (in our view) the pros and cons of staying there. The Sheraton is in the best location in Maui for being right on the ocean. We had a Deluxe Oceanfront room that was on BlackRock where you could throw a rock into the ocean from our balcony. The sounds of the ocean crashing into the rocks while you are on your balcony or have the balcony door open is amazing. It is a walk though or a couple elevator rides to the lobby of the hotel or the pool. If you are in any shape it all, its not a big deal, and the scenery walking through the breezeways overlooking Black Rock isn't bad either. The quality of the rooms is good for an island/beach area. They are nice but you're not staying at the St Regis NY, don't expect to be. I would recommend printing out the property map off the hotel's website which shows you the locations of the different types of rooms before you book: Deluxe Oceanfront means \"Oceanfront\". The Oceanfront category really doesn't mean \"oceanfront\", it appears that it means first level in the main building. I do think this is a little misleading but by printing out the map, you'll know before you book. You're also going to be charged about $26 a day for a resort fee. Just accept it, and use your free internet service that you get for it and you're free parking. The beach has arguably the best snorkeling on Maui. We've been to Maui several times and snorkeled in many places, but the reef off the Black Rock is as good as it gets. Not a bad thing to have at your hotel. You'll see many people coming down the beach from other hotels/public parking to snorkel at Black Rock. The beach is also fairly well protected from large waves, so you'll see more people in the water than at other beaches. Food and drink prices are high. We rarely eat at the property. There are many restaurants along the Boardwalk and there is a highly-rated, reasonably priced restaurant, with the best wine list in Maui (per Wine Spectator) about 1/3 of a mile north of the hotel on the beach -- called Castaway Cafe -- it's on the ocean, very laid-back and the food and wine are great -- go there! The pool area is nice, but (from reading the complaints) expect to see a lot of kids if you go during the summer or during holidays. We were there in September, there was hardly a kid to be seen. In general September through the end of the year aren't that busy in Maui except for during the Holidays. If its busy, poolside service can be slow. Instead of complaining about it on TripAdvisor, walk a hundred feet to the bar, you'll generally be served immediately. The spa is expensive, if you don't want to pay the high prices, go to a day spa in Kaanapali, have a local provider come to your hotel room or wait til you go home. Overall, we love staying at the Sheraton. It's not perfect, its not cheap, but it provides what is important to us -- great location, great beach, great snorkeling, wonderful oceanfront rooms.

We started our first day by chatting with the Conceriege down at the activites booth at the pool....she could not have been more helpful...we booked the following with her after her reccommendations and were thrilled with all of them: Snorkling Sailing Adventure on Teralani..amazing from start to finish. Old Lahina Luau, spectacular and the shuttle will drop you very close to it. Surfing Lessons with Maui Wave Riders, Adam was our instructor..amazing experience. She also arranged our car rental for 3 days...drove the road to Hana and also visited the Surfing Goat Dairy....make sure to go there..looks are deceiving it is well worth the $7 tour and tasting.

Off the property try, Hula Grill at Whalers Village and in Lahina, Pacific O, Leani's, Cheeseburgers in Paradise. The Sheraton really need to improve on some things though...first and foremost the chairs at the main pool...seriously the so called rule of not leaving your chair for more than an hour is not enforced...we watched a gentleman ask one of the pool staff about this as there was a couple who had two chairs and an umbrella in a prime spot for the whole day but sat in them twice. They even left to go snorkling for 2 hours and nothing was done about it. One has to book in for the beach chairs etc. and they are tagged..if you leave for over an hour they remove the tag....they really need to enforce this rule. Front Desk Staff..I only had to approach them 3 times and OMG, rude...and i talked to 3 different ones. I really thought i was in another hotel...it is like they were doing me a favour and i was putting them out. One girl did not even look up from what she was doing to speak to me. Our only other complaint is that it would have been nice after coming back from dinner to have a quiet drink....but after 9:30, forget about it...everything closed....we were not the only ones, we met plenty of people wandering in the evenings wanting to have a nightcap...Surely one bar could stay open until 11pm at least. Overall, a fantastic holiday at the Sheraton Maui but I really do urge the management to come up with some sort of an enforcable system for the pool chairs allocation. And maybe send all your front desk staff for some Customer Service training or even job shadow the staff that are exceptional at customer service, the conceirges, the wait staff, greeters and the chamber maids....all of these employees quite obviosly love their jobs and enjoy dealing with the public everyday!!

This was an amazing deal! Next time we return to Maui, we would stay here again but only if we get another amazing deal. The service and amenities at this hotel does not warrant their full price during high season in a normal economy. Hotel Location: This is their redeeming grace! Black Rock has spectacular snorkeling and was never too busy when we were there. The part of Kaanapali Beach fronting the Sheraton was wide and even though was on probably the most popular part of the beach, never seemed too crowded. If I recall correctly the cabana rentals were $40/day. The Maui sun gets HOT so the rental rate was very well worth it. These are true cabanas w/ \"convertible\" shades. If you rent early (before 11am) you are pretty much assured a front row and hence no blockage of view of the spectacular beach. It was also nice that the hotel was so close to Whaler's Village which had a decent selection of restaurants (sit down and food court) and an ABC store for supplies. As far as the hotel in general, I liked how it was never too crammed. Lots of space and very simple but nice vegetation all around. Room: We had a room on the 4th floor of building 6 which provided a spectacular view of the ocean (100% unobstructed) and sunset. The lanai was a good size and absolutely comfortable. The view was so great that we ended up ordering in 2 nights for dinner! I also like the fact that those staying in Bldg 6 had their own private parking. Aside from the location and view, the bed was comfortable enough. I find Hilton beds to be much more comfortable, but Sheraton's was good enough. The bedding was rough but livable for the short amount of time we were there. The bathroom was large enough and the room was in pretty good condition. No cracks or mildew as stated in some other reviews. The towels in the bathroom were a bit rough. All in all, they bill this as a 4 star property, I would rate them more at 3-3.5. Service: This is perhaps my biggest gripe about this hotel. The housekeeping staff was fine, but front desk was perhaps the worst I have ever dealt with. When we arrived we were assigned to a room w/ double beds due to over booking, however they did switch us the next day. This wasn't the problem. The problem was that I had to call them 3 seperate times to remind them of what they promised the first day. We were not the only ones who had this issue. 2 couples ahead of us had to deal with this as well. Anytime I called and asked questions they never seemed to know the answer and just randomly made up a response. For example, Starwood offers a shuttle into Lahaina so we decided to go this route the night of our luau and the front desk gave 2 different end times, none of the correct. Our a/c went on the fritz the 3rd night and they forgot to patch our call to maintenance the first time around. We didn't eat at the restaurants on the resort but did drink at the bars. The bartenders were great, but we did run into 2 waitresses who were SLOW...and at times when they were not even that busy. It is unacceptable to have empty drinks for more than 15 minutes. Another gripe was the $25/day resort fee. Not bad if they actually provided good amenities, but they didn't even offer wifi in your room. To me, its silly and unacceptable in this day and age to not have wifi.", "Date": "September 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New jersey", "Title": "\u201cBest Location for a hotel in Maui!!\u201d", "Author": "AtomicQ", "ReviewID": "UR42738061", "Content": "We went to Maui for the first week of our honeymoon & stayed at the Sheraton Maui hotel.

Modeled like a meandering lagoon it goes around the patio area of the resort where there is a nice bar, plenty of room pool side. Right from the pool you can walk 5 feet to get to the beach. The beach here is great because it is near the \"Black Rock\" which is an awesome Snorkeling spot, if you are so inclined. One thing though is do not rent the snorkel gear from the hotel, it's overpriced and you can get it from dive shops in Lahaina much cheaper. The hotel was in a short driving distance to downtown Lahaina which was the nicest little downtown area I explored in Maui. I would definitely stay here if I came to Maui again. The ONLY problem was that there were little ants in the room (which apparently cannot be helped in Maui) and the layout of the hotel was a little confusing as far as getting to the work out room.

Check-in was a breeze and everyone was friendly and helpful. Our room was quite a walk from the main lobby but had a nice view of Black Rock, the lawn, and the ocean. As we got in around 8:00 pm, we went to the restaurant for dinner. My husband and I had the seafood buffet. It was pretty bland and had a lot of fried food. The kids had pizza appetizers, which were good. We had an early snorkel trip the next day so really did not get to explore the resort until about 4:00 pm the 2nd day of our stay. The pool was quiet so we enjoyed a swim. My husband went to the room first and opened the sliding door. The rest of us arrived about 20 minutes later and the room was reeking of cigarette smoke. Hawaii has some pretty tough smoking rules and guests are not permitted to smoke within 20 feet of buildings, that includes balconies. We closed the door and called the front desk. They verified that smoking was not allowed and said they would speak to the guest in the next room who had been smoking on his balcony. We left for the evening. The next morning, the same thing happened from the same guest. Again, I shut the door and called the front desk and got the same story. We finally leaned over our balcony and explained to our neighbor that one could not smoke on balconies - he did not know. We were gone for the day and evening again. The next morning, I got up early, made coffee, and went to sit on my balcony to enjoy the morning - 7:00 am. There were 5 preschool children running and screaming and dismantelling a hammock. The adults stayed in their ground level rooms. All around I could see other guests getting up to go back into their rooms, close the door and have their coffee inside where it was quiet. I'm not sure why I paid for an ocean view room that I was unable to enjoy without peering through the glass. We stayed at 4 good hotels on this trip and only at this one were the other guests so intrusive. At the others, there were written policies about smoking and quiet times. When I said something at the front desk upon check-out, the clerk could not care less. If you are looking for serenity, the Sheraton is not for you; if you have young kids, apparently this is the spot for you. Included in the resort fee was a shuttle bus to Lahaina. We took advantage of it, but it was not necessary. We haven't been to Maui in 11 years and this time, Lahaina was a ghost town and plenty of parking was available. We had a 9:00 pm flight home and enjoyed snorkeling and swimming during our last day.

Not the best ever, but certainly better than most. We also ate at the outdoor restaurant near the pool one night, the Black Rock Restaurant one night and room service one night. Service was always great, though a tad slow. But who's in a rush in Maui anyway, right? Stay away from the \"california\" roll on the room service menu though.

On Maui we were staying in Kihei to be near the dive boats in the morning. (Maui Coast Hotel is Wonderful!) The last full day of our trip we were doing the zipline in Kaanapali and the Luau in Lahaina so we decided to move to Kaanapali. We also wanted to have a nice beach and pool to chill on the final day before we departed. The reviews of the Sheraton were positive and we found a reasonable price. Upon arriving they have a strange checkin process where you check in with the valet - that is unless you need to do anything. Our room was not ready so we asked for another room - then you have to go to the main front desk. They did however get us into the room at 3pm and upgraded us to a mountian / partial ocean view. (let us check in one hour early.) The grounds are absolutely gorgeous with a nice pool area with a lazy river connecting the pools. They are right on the beach with a nice beach and snorkeling available at Black Rock. You have to pay extra for loungers at the beach....kind of chintzy given the $26 per day resort fee. To their credit that resort fee did include parking and high speed internet. I found it odd, they made you wear wrist bands at the pool. My take, just close off the pool area and ask for proof of your stay to get in.....do not make me wear a wrist band. There were nice grassy areas and plenty of loungers. The bar at the pool made good drinks and the special of the day was pretty good. I really liked that the buildings were not high-rise and did not dominate the landscape. The public areas were very nice. Bell staff was very efficient. As for the rooms, well....they were very outdated and Housekeeping could have done a better job. The room smelled fresh, but they just cleaned the carpet when we got there. The bed was short sheeted (a pet peeve of mine!), and it was not a great bed. The room had small scratchy towels, and a tiny dark hot bathroom. You could not watch the TV from the work desk. The iron and blow dryers were very weak. The room had a nice LCD HDTV, the air conditioning worked well, and you could leave the blower motor on for white noise. The balcony and chairs were very nice to sit and have a muffin for breakfast. We had no problem with noise during our stay. The hotel provides free (well, paid for in your resort fee, so not free) scheduled shuttle service to Lahaina Town and the Westin. This was very nice so that we did not have to drive or take a taxi to the Old Lahaina Luau. (Open bar....no point in driving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Excellent Luau) The hotel was an easy walk to Whalers Village. The staff was professional but not particularly warm. (with the exception of the concierge who was very nice.) For the rate of $183 per night I felt that we got a good deal, especially for Kaanapali beach.

I love playing in the ocean, swimming in the pool, lounging in the jacuzzi with an umbrella drink, and when I'm in Maui, I love the snorkeling. This hotel has it all. Let's start with the snorkeling. Black Rock has awesome sea life. Last trip we saw a white tipped shark (not dangerous), a school of white spotted manta rays, squid, shrimp, and of course a maginficent array of fish. The previous trip to that 3 large sea turtles were swimming right by the beach, so close that I almost accidentally stepped on it (but avoided to, as you're not supposed to touch them). We have our own snorkel mask and snorkel, and rent our fins from Maui Dive Shop for $3/day (versus renting fins for $15/day at the hotel). With that $3 a day we go snorkeling every day for free. It's just lovely. When not snorkeling, the poolside is wonderful, or you can hang out at the beach. The cabana rentals at the hotel are $40 a day which I think is reasonable when you consider it's $5 an hour if you stay the whole day. You need some cover from the relentless Maui sun, and occasional sprinkle. The long white sand beach is great to walk, where you can visit the other resorts along the way, or even stop at the Whalers Village mall (which is expensive to park at if you drive there). At sunset, they do a cliff dive off Black Rock, but people also jump off Black Rock all day. *As an aside, please be careful in the water! There are no lifeguards on this beach. Snorkel with someone else if at all possible, and stay away from the rock jumpers. Also, the current can be strong around the coral, so don't get too close to the shallow coral areas as you could get scraped. I would not recommend dining at the hotel, with the exception of the Lagoon bar which is open at lunch time. The $11 ribs and $13 nachos (as big as my head, and that's saying a lot) are really well worth it. The Lagoon bar also has good Happy Hour drink specials. Our room was an Ocean Deluxe, which we were upgraded to for free (our rate was $225 a night, plust the standard $25 a day resort fee). Usually when we ask, if they have an upgrade availalbe, they give it to us.

This hotel is situated on top of Black Rock, which probably would not be allowed today since it has historical importance to the people of Hawai'i, but this presents incredible ocean views from most rooms, especially building 6. Check-IN & Room: The hotel staff was extremely friendly, and very helpful with our requests. We were greeted with complimentary champagne for my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s birthday and the in room check-in was an especially nice touch. It works like this: you are greeted at the curb with complimentary valet (it costs a few dollars after the first day), and escorted to your room where they explain a little bit about the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s offerings and give you a check-in package (keys, vouchers, etc.) and later you can go by the front desk to have them run your card for any incidental charges. We arrived right at sunset, an especially nice treat. The rooms have been nicely updated to modern expectations; you can hardly notice the hotel is 50+ years old, except that the walls are solid concrete. This makes the rooms seem more isolated than they are. They have good comfortable beds, similar to Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heavenly bed, LCD TV, nice bathroom and beautiful views. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m very conscious of the bed because of a bad back, but I had no trouble from the bed at the Sheraton. The walk from building 6 to the main area of the hotel took about 3-5 minutes, but along the way there is an amazing open air atrium (used to be the lobby back in the old days) that has a constant breeze and direct view of the ocean and black rock, plus free wifi. We felt like this was our private room because there was hardly ever anyone there, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great place to enjoy everything the beach has to offer without any crowds, sand or heat. Dining: Our package included free breakfast, which normally cost $28/pp. The buffet spread was varied and quite good. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure if it was $28 good, but the offerings were so different that I was never bored in 7 days of dining there. They typically offer an array of fresh fruit, smoked salmon bar, about 6 hot items, several cereals and yogurts, a breakfast burrito station, an omelet station, plus several fresh fruit juices including pineapple, guava, and orange. The dining room is open air and mostly situated outdoors (watch out for the birds that seem to converge on plates when they abandon their table). There is a coffee cart located above the breakfast buffet that serves Starbucks drinks. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find this until our 3rd day. The breakfast restaurant transforms in Black Rock Steak and Seafood at night. This was the only negative experience of our stay. We had a $100 credit to the restaurant in our package, so we reviewed the menu and made reservations for the following night. Once we arrived the menu had been restricted, apparently they offer a dinner buffet some night and the menu is pared down accordingly. Not a huge deal, but it would have been nice to know before we made our plans. The dinner was ok, but nothing inspired or exceptional. In fact, this restaurant needs to be completely rethought, new theme & new menu. While the pricing is normal for Maui, there should be more effort put into a hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s signature restaurant. Activities: The grounds are beautiful and their age really shows in good ways. There are numerous open grassy areas between the buildings with hammocks and palm trees, which you will not find at any other resort on Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali beach (we looked). Black rock has some excellent snorkeling and other water activities. There is a rental place located near the pool that has everything from SCUBA equipment down to boogie boards. You can rent the same equipment at far lower prices by going to a Boss Frogs or Dive Maui (both are about a 5 minute drive). The pool is huge and winds through the grounds with many places to sunbathe, shade-seek and relax, plus it has a proper deep end. There is always a waitress nearby with cocktails (order a drink inside a pineapple or coconut for a kitschy treat), and there are two poolside restaurants.

My wife and I went for our anniversary trip for some rest and relaxation, the Maui Sheraton delivered. A beautiful 40 minute drive from the airport will bring you to the hotel, driving through the wonderful town of Lahaina. The hotel has a great pool with a deep end, a small slide, a few waterfalls, and a shallow end for kids. The beach is pristine, white sandy beaches, light surf, and water that is blue as it gets. The hotel offers multiple rentals right on the beach, things such as snorkel gear, body boards, rafts, and chase lounges. Our room was the standard king and it had plenty of space for two, standard accommodations, and a great view, the room and resort were a great value for the cost. The Sheraton offers a shuttle service to the downtown area of Lahaina, this is where we spent our evenings. Front Street has many different kinds of restaurants, shops, art stores, and entertainment. I love seafood and my wife hates it, we did not have any problems finding a compromise on where to eat, and we did not have to repeat. Finally a few pointers, first we felt the drinks were overpriced at the resort (typical) but if you check the week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s calendar in your room it states \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy hour\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd when drinks are half off. We had lunch twice at the outdoor bar/grill, again overpriced, $18 for a chicken wrap with tip and tax. I am not the kind of person that minds spending money on a good meal but not much value to lunch, dinner in town was 20-30 with a salad, fresh fish, side, and a drink. Also skip the Luau at the Sheraton, we watched the show and were not very impressed. We booked the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Old Lahaina Luau\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for the same price, the food choices were much larger, drinks were included, they did the whole buried pig thing, and the event lasted 3 hours.

We loved the layout of the pool, bar/restaurant, and beach - we could switch from one tho the other with ease throughout the day. The beach, Ka'anapali, is gorgeous, and has direct views of the islands of Moloka'i and Lana'i in the distance. We met people all over the island who said they had hoped to catch a glimpse of a green sea turtle while snorkeling at various beaches, but had not. Well, at the Sheraton these turtles swim right out front , near Black Rock , so close that I could reach out and touch them while snorkeling ! We had great service during the whole week we were there, and everyone we dealt with was genuinely friendly and helpful - we really felt the \"aloha spirit\" from all the employees at the Sheraron. The guys at the poolside-beachfront bar were especially fun and friendly! They have happy hour there for three hours every day, and the drinks are half price - a great deal that we made sure to take advantage of ! Some people have compained that the restaurants at the Sheraton are too expensive...well, we couldn't afford to have dinner there every night either, so we didn't - but don't these people want to get out and about in the evening, anyway ? We would enjoy great, reasonably priced burgers or chicken or mahi mahi for lunch at the Sheraton beach bar, and then go off the property for dinner. There is a mile long beach path with several good restaurant you can walk to, or you can hop into your car and drive 5 minutes to Lahaina town for great food and nightlife.

Overall, we enjoyed this hotel, but it definitely lacks the style and elegance of other Sheraton and Westin properties that we have visited worldwide over the years. We used our Starwood points for this stay (we are SPG gold), and that made it a good deal. Six nights for five nights worth of points, and we took the Moana Program upgrade for $150 per night which we enthusiastically recommend. This upgrade included a prime ocean front room with lanai in building six (Moana), turndown service every night, late checkout, 35% off food in the restaurants, and best of all, it covered the $26 per night \"resort fee\" (parking, internet, etc.), the breakfast buffet for two every morning (regularly priced at $26.95 each), and one hour of free cocktails at the poolside Lagoon Bar. A glass of wine is $12 at this bar, so it's easy to run up an expensive bar bill quickly. Excellent bartenders at the Lagoon Bar! Our room was large and included a small refrigerator, microwave, safe, and a large bathroom. This hotel did not have the special resort themed toiletries that we enjoyed at the Princeville Westin Resort two years ago. Instead the toiletries were the same as every other Sheraton, and lacked a shower cap (provided promptly once we called guest services). The lanai was furnished with a table and two chairs, so perfect for the two of us. The room furnishings were very low quality, with several drawers on the dresser and nightstands off their tracks, and substantial damage to the exterior wood. The large flat screen TV worked well, but at least one of the cable stations had audio problems for several days. Maui was very hot (temps around 90F every day) and 100% humidity during our stay, so we appreciated the good air conditioning system in our room. Housekeeping service was fine, and we skipped one day's housekeeping as part of the hotel's \"go green\" plan, which earned us a $40 credit towards dinner in their restaurants. We also reported a slow draining sink, which was promptly fixed, and we received a $15 coupon towards lunch or dinner for our report of this problem. Turndown service included fresh towels and a quick straightening up of the room. Overall we found the staff to be friendly and mostly competent. We agree with other reviewers that the hostess system for breakfast makes no sense. The hostess had to write down our info in three separate places, and if you asked a question during this process, she got off track and became flustered. One hostess was grim and unfriendly. We were surprised that Starwood does not have more robust automation and procedures for restaurant queuing. The pool area is well designed. Be aware that this hotel has franchised-out management of pool services. Pool towels are shabby and falling apart. You are given one plastic pool card per guest upon check in, and you must use this card to obtain a towel at the pool. You get a card back when you turn in the towel at the end of the day. The front desk will give you more pool towel cards upon request, cautioning you that there is a $15 charge if you do not turn all your pool cards in at check out. Unlike other Starwood hotels, this Sheraton does not have a separate adult only pool or pool deck area (we understand that the Westin Maui down the street does have an adult pool). Our visit was during family season, and there were many children in the pool splashing and diving into the water. You must get to the pool deck early in the morning (by 7AM) in order to get pool loungers under one of the stationary umbrellas. We did rent a beach cabana for two, which was $40 for the day, and would recommend this over renting beach chairs and an umbrella. The pool staff gives each guest a wristband each day so as to keep the pool areas for hotel guests only (the beach, like all Hawaiian beaches, is open to the public). Pool service for lunch was competent, but not outstandingly attentive. We found that splitting a $15 wrap was more than enough for a light lunch. It was our overall impression that except for the Lagoon Bar, the restaurants and other food outlets are understaffed. We enjoyed two wonderful dinners at the Tropica restaurant located in the Westin down the beach. You are permitted to charge to your room account at several of the hotels on the Kaanapali beach strip. We used the concierge desk to book one dinner. It was nice that on one day at the beginning of our stay, a concierge came around to everyone lounging at the pool to enquire if they could be of service. Note that this was the only day that we saw a concierge poolside. Do not confuse the concierge staff with the Starwood Vacations staff that tries to sell you a timeshare! They are friendly and will leave you several voicemails until you drop by their desk. There are many events at this hotel such as a barbeque buffet night, a luau, and a movie night. We did not go to any of these events, but they appear to be popular, especially with the many families staying at this hotel. So we would recommend this hotel to families looking for a good Starwood value.

Ocean VIEW maybe, if you looked past the grounds, the pool and palm trees, the growth that separated the pool and the beach and THEN, you could see the beach and the ocean beyond. The bed was comfortable, but that was about all I have to say on the positive side. No turn down service with a flower on the pillow (like we've had at every other hotel we've stayed at on Maui), the meals were OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive ($60 for breakfast for two) and weren't even that good. We were charged for water, that we did NOT open or take (didn't notice this until we were going over the bill on the flight home) and we constantly had notes that one thing or another was being tested, cleaned or killed during the week we were there. Bug sprayers came one day and that left a dozen 2\" long dead cockroaches on our balcony... VERY enjoyable when you want to sit out and enjoy the sunset. There was only ONE chair on our balcony, so my husband and I coudn't even sit out together to enjoy the morning breezes. The pool was often so crowded that you couldn't get a lounge chair and if you wanted a lounge chair on the beach, you had to pay extra for that. When my husband made the reservations, he requested a late check-out. When he confirmed the reservation, he made the request again. When we checked in, he again made the request and the day before we're leaving, we're told we can't get it. Oh wait...

The grounds are wonderful, as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the breathtaking beach & the Black Rock area where the place sits. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all. The rooms are little more than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsimply good\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, and in certain buildings the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s architecture makes them be laid out in an almost anti-democratic way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c rooms that are theoretically of the same level are not in the practice. For instance, in building 3, the higher floor, the smaller room or balcony you get. As a result, you may have reserved, let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say, an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with a private lanai, and find yourself in a quite run of the mill room with an extremely tiny outdoor space which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even deserve the name \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbalcony\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 because it has only space (barely...) for an extremely compact table and ONE ONLY CHAIR. Wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t it a room for 2 people? I simply cannot understand how a four star property can have so stingy and shabby touches (sometimes you may even not get lanai or balcony at all. I remember one guest complaining because, based on his reservation description, he and his girlfriend were supposed to have a room with a lanai and they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get one. Simply surreal! But what I get even less is how, for example, in building 3, someone who is staying in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room can get a bigger balcony/lanai than someone who is staying in an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, which is a more expensive room. Anyway, the views in the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ocean front rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from building 3 are simply to guffaw (to help you make an idea, Hilton Hawaiian Village\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ocean view rooms have clearer views of the ocean than Sheraton Maui\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s building 3 ocean front rooms). The service was a joke, and a very bad one, by the way. A good part of the staff was rude and seemed to be constantly pissed off (namely some restaurant hostess) and some were really unpleasant or even rude (particularly a lady called Jacqueline), another part (namely the restaurant waiters) worked a lot and was good and kind in general, but seemed to feel helpless all time, maybe because of being too few employees for a big resort as the Sheraton is. And then there was the front desk staff, which was simply completely incompetent and inefficient. It constantly failed to answer the guests most basic questions, including those related to hurricane Felicia (that was in those days about to reach Hawaii). Regarding hurricane Felicia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s evolution, there was a very young girl at the front desk, whose name I cannot remember, but for whom the job was obviously far too big. She gave answers like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153well, we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know anything about it...\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd followed by a frivolously wink-peppered and absurdly obvious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153... I would say watch the news\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd). The breakfast table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s designation system was absolutely bizarre. First you had to register at the hostess stand, where someone would write down your name and tell you to seat by the hall sofas and armchairs and wait (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153a couple of minutes\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) to be seated. Then the party immediately behind you would go through exactly the same process, and so on... As a result, you could see all these ready tables completely empty and a fairly good line of people waiting to be seated. It was terribly clumsy, slow and sense-lacking system. The housekeeping was nothing to write home about. Our bath gel was never replaced, so we had to ask for it every day by phone calling the guest service. One day, little after we had found out (once again...) that our gel hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been replaced, we suddenly ran into the maid and asked her for it. To our surprise she told us that they only provide your bathroom with bath gel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by request\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Incredible!!!! Something as basic as the bath gel!!! Shame-on-you... That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the only absurd thing from the housekeeping. That very same day we had left our towels in the floor, obviously meaning that we needed new ones (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what hotels services guides indicate guests should do, and the Sheraton Maui one was no different). To our surprise, the maid picked them from the floor and returned them to the bathroom, where she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even fold them and placed them in the towel rack, but she instead placed them hanging on the bath curtain pole. No further comments. The food prices are simply outrageous. Given the breakfast buffet costs $26 (plus tax and service tip) per person, for a good selection (but not even close to being the best or the most varied ever seen, anyway), you can imagine the prices of the mediocre dinner buffets, the not-exactly-mouthwatering \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a la carte\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd menus, or the plain and pretty standard snacks and drinks at the pool bars. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind being charged that way if I feel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m being given a service to match. But that definitely wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the case... And what about that bad taste joke called $26.04 daily \u00e2\u20ac\u0153resort charge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd? What a cheat!! The Sheraton Maui tries in vain, with all its usual sham of \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsomersaults, trapezes and fireworks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, to convince its guests that it is a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal touch\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (with such \u00e2\u20ac\u0153personal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd touches, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather prefer the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impersonal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ones) that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153adds value to your resort experience by eliminating several indicated charges in favor of one daily assessed resort charge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Those theoretically indicated charges are from things such as hula lessons, scheduled shuttle service to Lahaina (the only thing from the hotel that worked 100%), or the slowest in-room internet access I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen in my life. Sorry but, still having in mind the magnificent London West Hollywood Hotel larger-than-life rooms and the super-fast complimentary (yes, completely free) internet access, I have to laugh. And to cap it all, the hotel grounds are, of course, plagued with unbearable kids. Some of them were amongst the most irritating and worst mannered I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever seen, although watching their parents, one perfectly understands where that ugly attitude comes from... Summing up, Maui is a wonderful island. It has lots and lots to offer, with its various microclimates, incredible beaches, breathtaking landscapes and so on. Although very commercialized, it lives up to its reputation of having been considered many times \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe best island in the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by the readers of Conde Nast Traveler magazine. But the Sheraton Maui, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sad to say, is far below the level of the whole place. It could be a great place, but it lacks adequate attitude and has a great surplus of cash-greed, which tries to disguise with false smiles, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcaloha-to-everyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 boring sentences and so on.

We were given a top floor room in building 3, but opted for a bottom floor room in building 2 so that our child could run out the door onto the lawn. If you are traveling with children, it's a smart move. They put most of the families in building 2 and 3 and then try to put the honeymooners in #4 & 5. That makes sense. Our room was spacious, clean, and the bathroom has been recently remodeled. No complaints. My biggest problem was with the service. First of all, they only do room service for breakfast and dinner, so you're out of luck on lunch. That's fine, but most people are out by the pool or beach during lunch and don't want to get dressed and go to a restaurant. There was only one server out by our pool and they were very hard to track down. If you're planning to have someone bring you drinks all day - forget it. I placed orders with them, and then they'd never arrive. I'd have to drag myself up to the bar and redo everything. Again, not a show stopper but not great service. I also went to the \"new spa\" to get a massage\". It's not worth the money. Go down to the Westin for spa services. I was promply greated at the front desk and put in the waiting room. Then I was taken directly to the massage room (no locker with snuggly robes and flip flops). My masseuse was great and got right to work, but for $135 I expect to be pampered. The massage room was partially open to the outdoors, so instead of quiet music I heard an endless stream of guests talking about dinner plans, etc. The beach is spectacular, and the evening activities cannot be beat. We love to have an early dinner and then come watch the cliff diving ceremony each night. We did not attend the luau, but did watch portions of it. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Bottom line: If you don't travel a lot and this is your first time to Maui, you'll love it but will be shocked at the food prices. If you do travel a lot, you'll be unimpressed with the service but the location is great for small kids. In comparison with the Westin, they are two very different hotels. The Westin has better service, smaller but nicer rooms, and has a lot more to offer. It's also a lot busier. If you really want to unwind, you can do that at the Sheraton, but don't expect to be pampered. Ultimately, we decided not to let the cons ruin our vacation, and we just embraced the positives because everything (except the food) is better in Maui!", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cNice property, but with a split personality\u201d", "Author": "vegaslover73", "ReviewID": "UR35149617", "Content": "The Sheraton Maui has great potential as a four-star resort at one of the most beautiful locations on Maui.

We had a garden view room in building 3 which was nice. Close to the lobby, beach, parking, etc. I could definitly see some issues if you were in another building. The Sheraton is spread way out over 5 buildings. We spent most of the day at the beach and enjoying the fantastic snorkeling. Black Rock is incredible. Skip the tours and just enjoy this spot. If you go just around the corner of Black Rock you will see some incredible sights and you can be back in your room within five mintues. We spent $20 for an umbrella rental which was a life-saver cause it's very hot and sunny. For lunch I drove out to the Lahaina Market which is just of HWY 30, the main drag from Lahaina to the airport. They had great fresh food and the prices were very, very reasonable. The hotel food, drink is a rip-off, way too pricey for my liking. We did stop at the K-mart by the airport for water, beer, snacks which will save you quite a lot also. The K-mart also has some very reasonably-priced souveneirs that are about half what you will pay in Lahaina or the hotels and it's the same stuff. At night we did the luau at the Royal Lahaina resort which is an easy walk from the Sheraton. It was about $130 for the four of us (kids free) which was ok except the food was pretty plain. We all enjoyed the dancers and fire performers so all in all, a good day out. The next day we just hung out at the beach and relaxed. I would recommend the hotel but they do charge you for just about everything. You get a $26 resort charge which I'm not sure what that covers. They don't have any computers in the lobby for internet usage although they have wifi in the lobby. (I don't like to carry a laptop).

There is a loud droning noise (presumably the A/C) eminating from building 1 at all hours of the day and night. If you are noise sensitive or would rather hear the birds and waves rather than the sound of an engine, then request a room not facing building 1. esp. avoid building 2. 2. There is a luau a few times a week on the front lawn. It is enjoyable the first few times. After that, it becomes a pain. Next time I would look for a quieter part of the hotel. 3. MOVIE NIGHT. All I can say is UGH! Imagine being in a tropical paradise and just as the sun is setting loud music begins to blare, and then the whole place is transformed into a drive-in movie theatre. The movie (not that that mattered) was Charlie's Angels. Ick! There were all of 8 people watching the movie (I counted) and for that, scores of people endured the intrusion that lasted 4 hours! 4. They charge $70 per night for a rollaway bed!!!! OMG. We were there for 10 days. For that price I could have bought a bed. What a rip. So if you have 3 kids you are totally out of luck! 5. There are many non-guests at the pool. It is plainly obvious. They show up with their bath towels from home and their picnics from Safeway. Two groups were seated next to us under the umbrellas last week taking up a totally prime spot by the kids pool. An employee came over to speak to them at one point. They admitted to being non-guests. The employee told them they were not allowed to swim but no one made them leave. As far as I could tell, they (and their 6 kids) swam all day. Not a big deal but it makes the place feel more crowded and hey, I would have liked the umbrella and I was a paying guest. 6. The tennis courts and the tennis staff were awesome. An absolute wow. Every day we had these amazing facilities all to ourselves. The pros were very accommodating and super friendly. If for no other reason, we would return just for the tennis. 7. The breakfast buffet is good if you get the free coupons with your room as part of the package. Otherwise, it is hardly worth $26. Avoid the evening buffet. The quality is just not there. 8. Wifi is very patchy Lastly, the grounds are lovely and the beach is the best in the area. The surf was high while we were there so the snorkeling was not what it could have been. I went out every day and found the fish count and visibility a little disappointing compared to years past. Better snorkeling up in Honolua is you are serious about it.

The hotel is visually stunning, with beatiful grounds and a great beach. We were greeted promptly by the bell staff and were quickly put in our room. We stayed on the fifth floor of building three and had a great view of the beach and pool area. The room was average and had a small bathroom. The bed was comfy, but the pillows were TERRIBLE! I scrunched two together and still barely had any support. Breakfast was included in our package and we ate daily at the buffett. We enjoyed breakfast there and found the food to be good and the service was nice as well. Since I didn't pay for it directly, I can't comment on the value. We all LOVED the pool area and did alot of swimming. With a three year old, we hung out exclusively at the kiddie pool side, but we were always able to find a spot to sit. The beach area was great, with excellent sand, but the waves were quite rough during our stay. We only played at the beach for maybe two hours the whole time. We did attend the luau at the Sheraton and we all enjoyed it. I have read negative reviews about the Sheraton Luau, with the negatives primarily centered around value. Yes, it isn't cheap (nothing there is), but I found the food to be good. I had previously been to a luau on Oahu and found the Sheraton Luau far superior. We booked some off site excursions with Monica at the concierge desk and I would recommend her. Our big trip was over to Pearl Harbor. If you make it all the way to Hawaii, you must go to the Arizona Memorial and the battleship Missouri. The Arizona Memorial doesn't take long, but is a touching place. My three year old LOVED the Missouri and climbed all over the ship. We visited the Whalers Village daily. It is a nice area to go and we ate down there several times. My favorite sit down place was Leilanis. I found the price to be equal to the product and would recommend it. My least favorite was the Hula Grill. Our meal was mediocre and it was quite expensive. We also ate at the food court several times (Nic's pizza is good). The hotel also has a \"free\" shuttle that goes to Lahaina. We took it one day and it was convenient for us, but I would just rent a car. We got one from Enterprise at the Sheraton and had it for three days and really enjoyed it. I found driving on Maui to be very easy. We drove to the Ocean Center and also drove to Hana. Ocean Center is an easy drive. Hana is a touch harder!

The downside was that there were little ants all over the armoire where the tv sits, and the a/c did not seem to be working very well as the room just did not seem to cool down to comfort level. Also, there were stains on the sheets on our first night and we had to get housekeeping to come to our room in the evening to change out our sheets. They also came to vaccum the ants, but they were with us the entire trip as they never totally went away. The a/c never did fully cool down our room, and although we had a fabulous time in Maui and enjoyed every minute there, we were disappointed in the lack of quality of the actual room. For as much as we paid a night, we expected a more luxurious and comfortable room. We would probably stay at the Westin which is a sister property the next time we are there. You also have dining privileges at both hotel properties, so you can check both properties out. The beach was amazing and the snorkeling at black rock was phenomenal. We saw several honu (sea turtles) while we were there. The best thing to do is to rent a cabana on the beach for the day ($40 at the time) and just lounge on the beach and enjoy the ocean.

Based on the great reviews of the beach, we decided to go with the Sheraton. As reported the beach is lovely and is certainly a great site for snorkeling. The hotel however was a big disappointment. We booked a deluxe oceanfront king for $500 per night for the view. As reported by others, the view is fantastic. The room, however, was a major disappointment. The bathroom is dated, the glass tops on the furniture were chipped, lamps had burned out bulbs and are currently painted brown but the chips in the paint reveal were once green. All in all pretty shabby. The worst thing was the smell. It appeared that a previous guest had left food to spoil or had vomited in the closet. Obviously I couldn't put my clothes in there but the smell also permeated the room. We complained and housekeeping was sent to spray a deodorizer which served only to temporarily mask the smell. On day 2 our air conditioner quit working and it took some time for the repairman to show up. He advised us that there would be an unpleasant odor from the burned rubber hose when the unit began to function again. Sara in guest services agreed to send an ionizer to the room to hep with that smell. She also offered to removed the $25 per day resort fee from our bill. Later that night while the repairman was still working, he advised us that the broken hose had leaked water all over the carpet on that side of the room and that it would likely mildew and smell for several days. He advised us to request a room change. Sara in guest services agreed to move us but indicated that we would have to wait for a room to be cleaned. At 9:00 that night we were moved to our new room. Sara offered to let us have a late check out on our day of departure to compensate us for the inconvenience. We were happy about this as our flight did not depart until 9:00 p.m. The rest of our stay was fine. The second room was clean and odor free. However, upon checkout, we discovered that the $25 per day resort charge had NOT been removed from our bill. I called guest services and spoke to Brandy who indicated that we could have EITHER the credit for the resort fee or the late check out. Since it was 4:00 pm and we had already used the late checkout, we could not have the credit for the resort fee. I explained the conversations I had with Sara reagrding the various problems with our first room and that the resort fee credit was offered for the original complaint and that the late checkout was later offered for the broken air conditioner/impending mildew problem/room change. Brandy refused to honor this agreement so I had to spend 45 minutes at the front desk explaining all of this to the assistant manager, Brandon, who ultimately did honor the agreement. All in all, the Sheraton does not seem concerned with providing pleasant or even functioning accomodation nor do they feel compelled to honor the compensations offered by guest services (unless you are willing to insist). I recommend that you stay at the Westin or another property in the area.

I cannot imagine there is a room in Maui with a better view and closer to the sounds and sights of the ocean. Vast ocean view and nightly sunsets in front of you, a view of Black Rock just barely to the left and another rock formation directly below\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6so you get the wonderful sound of waves gently crashing. And water so clear that we could see yellow fish and turtles. Clearly these rooms must be better than those in the other buildings (based on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153complainy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd reviews) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was not outdated, nicely appointed, was spotlessly clean and had great housekeeping services. If you want a Ritz Carlton 5-star room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stay there, but then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be about \u00c2\u00bc mile from the ocean. Or good luck at any of the other 5 stars upgrading to a room with this view/proximity to the ocean/beach. At night, the torches on Black Rock stay lit until about 10 and provide a beautiful, peaceful sight from your lanai. You cannot convince me that there is a better location with nice room on the island. If you complain about the walk to the rest of the resort, you clearly have done no research about where you are going. We found the walk to the rest of the resort to be short, easy and probably the light walk we needed a couple of times a day to walk off some (not many) calories. Quiet, peaceful, lovely.\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.bliss. THE BEACH \u00e2\u20ac\u201c When you are staying at the only resort where you can walk down from your room, sit on a beautiful sand beach and either play in some waves or snorkel around a black rock and see tons of fish and turtles everyday, is there anyplace better?? People from other resorts walk quite a way to come to this beach. It deserves the great reputation. Really terrific snorkeling. THE POOL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ummm, who cares when you have that gorgeous beach??? If you want a magnificent pool go to Vegas for crying out loud! Seriously, there is a separate pool for kiddos so the main pool was pretty quiet and laid back. It was lovely\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not grand\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but lovely. The Westin pool is definitely better in looks, but, again, if you want a really good pool, head to the Bellagio. Plus, we did not see nearly the amount of children, or crowds for that matter, at the Sheraton as we did at the Westin main pool. DINING \u00e2\u20ac\u201c While we were there the Lagoon Bar was undergoing renovations so only the Sundowner was available during the day. You must go here and ask for Claudia. She had what we like to call the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153yes face\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a genuinely delightful, cheerful, cordial person who wanted nothing more than to make your stay perfect and accommodate you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.a quality rarely seen anymore within the service industry. The veggie wraps and grilled veggie plate were both outstanding for a lighter, healthy lunch. Had one of those two everyday for lunch so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak to the other more fattening choices (remember, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a bathing suit!). We ate at Black Rock Steakhouse our first night for convenience sake\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.it was okay but nothing to write home about. . Skip it and take the short walk to Whalers Village and eat a Hula Grill or Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (see separate Trip Advisor reviews). I guess it all depends on what you are looking for. Our priorities were: a 4-star or above room with not just a full ocean view but one right on the ocean (as close as we could get); a resort with a great beach for sun tanning, swimming and snorkeling; a resort within walking distance of activities, dining and shopping; beautiful grounds; friendly, gracious resort staff.

This resort was amazing... My husband and I got married Memorial Day Weekend in California (May 23rd weekend) and directly left for our honeymoon at the Sheraton Maui. We were there from May 27, 2009 until June 2, 2009. We booked a great package deal through Expedia and were fortunate to get such a great resort and round trip airfare for the price we paid. From the moment we arrived in Maui (our first trip), we knew we were in paradise. We used Speedi Shuttle to get to our resort from the airport. I recommend this shuttle service as they are affordable and quick. We swiftly arrived at the Sheraton Maui after a gorgeous drive and stopped at the lower level lobby of the resort. There we were greeted by a young man in a golf cart. We told him we were checking in. He put all of our luggage into his golf cart and called someone at the front desk from his walkey talkey. They told him we were all checked in and he could take us straight to our room. WOW! What service. We didn't even have to step foot into the lobby, he took us right from the road to our room. There was when we got our second surprise. Expedia had told Sheraton Maui that we were on our honeymoon and they upgraded us from an Ocean View Room to an Ocean Front Suite (Room 6313). WOW! This room is immaculate. The room overlooks the beautiful ocean and with a great view of the infamous \"Black Rock.\" Our beautiful balcony provided us with immaculate views of the ocean, and two of the other islands (Molokai and Lanai) as well as daily views of turtles and dolphins swimming by. In short, the room was amazing and the service was beyond our expectations. Our stay only got better. The service at Sheraton Maui is impeccable! We were treated amazingly throughout our stay. A knock on the door and someone was there with a complimentary bottle of champagne to welcome us to the Sheraton. This resort is all in all, the ONLY place I would ever stay in Kaanapali. We were able to take a stroll on the beach and check out the other hotels from the sand banks, but never felt the need to go in and look around... we were way too happy with the Sheraton to even care about any of the other properties. Plus, to be honest, I'm sure the other properties are nice in their own way, but there's NO way they can compare to the exterior of the Sheraton. All of the other hotels on the strip look like high rise hotels... the Sheraton does not... it looks like a RESORT and you constantly feel like you are in paradise. The pools are gorgeous as well as the entire ground. One complaint is that that you kind of have to go on a journey to get to the beach from our suite as we were on the top of the cliff. But a five minute walk through 2 different sets of elevators was well worth the final product... and it gave us the opportunity to walk off our consumption of way too many goodies. The only other complaint I have is that the hotel is ridiculously pricey, but what do you expect from a five star resort? We avoided eating and drinking much at this hotel or any other hotel. In fact, we brought a lot of our own alcohol from home and visited a nearby Safeway in Lahaina town for lunch foods. We were able to pick up sandwich meats and breakfast foods. Often we hung out at the beach in front of Black Rock ALL day, so it was nice to have a picnic basket packed with goodies and just hang out on the beach. We did this mostly everyday so it saved on our cost of food. We treated ourself to dinner each night in Lahaina town. My husband and I are into eating local food, so we stayed away from chains like Bubba Gump. Mixed Plate was delish, so was the pizza at Gabby's... but I seriously loved Cheeseburgers in Paradise. Their food was delish and everything was super affordable, not to mention their view was the best out of all the restaurants in Lahaina town! Make sure if you stay at the Sheraton you go to the Old Lahaina Luau in Lahaina town. It is well worth the $100 a person. And from what we saw of the Sheraton's Luau, it is far more \"authentic\" and traditional. I highly recommend it. The food is to die for and its all you can eat and drink, plus great live entertainment. One more tid bit of advice... rent a car. We thought 'we won't need a car much' and we were wrong. We went to Lahaina town each night for dinner. A round trip taxi ride can run you $30... but so can a rental of a car for the entire day. So you are far better off getting your money's worth if you rent a car for $30-40 a day rather than paying that much for ONE roundtrip taxi ride. Rent a car, believe me, you'll thank me. And make sure to take the road to Hana... I can talk about the Sheraton Maui for days, but I won't. I'll end with this... make sure you swim with turtles (it is a memorable experience), snorkel, and parasail... all things we did and enjoyed. If you have any questions, feel free to message me. Whatever you do, make sure you stay at the Sheraton in Maui.... you will not regret it! We will DEFINITELY return to the Sheraton Maui, hopefully for our one year anniversary!

I did wonder to other hotels further done the beach, and they seemed to have more people going through them. This is a very private resort, as it is built into the cliffs and at the end of the row of hotels. Every evening they do a ritual ceremony at sunset, and a man jumps from the cliffs into the sea. Some evenings there are activities and fun things to do at the resort. The rooms were immaculate, and loved having a terrace in the morning to sit on, watch the sun rise, reading the paper and drinking coffee....but a little less of reading the paper because of the gorgeous views. I saw dolphins and turtles swim by at least 5 times. It was easy to go into Lahaina and enjoy the shops. The staff was wonderful....suggested places to go and things to do in town. I was able to book a snorkling trip to Kaui through the hotel....concierge was wonderful. Food at the hotel is pricier then in town, but that is true at any hotel you stay at. The food is delicious, but definitely go in town to enjoy a more social dining experience. Hawaii is never a cheap trip, but reading some of the reviews some seem to expect it to be....those who are pinching their pennies, can go to fast food restaurants just 3-4 hotels away. Also there is a grocery store closer to in town...easy cab ride there. Overall, I do use this hotel to benchmark other hotels in other locations. Really the BEST hotel along the beach.

The room was perfect...comfortable bed and tasteful decor; the property immaculate (stunning grounds, largest and nicest sandy beach on this strip of Maui, FOR SURE); the activities ample; the staff friendly and knowledable.

The Hyatt and Westin were RIDICULOUSLY crowded, with no sandy beach to lay out on, and lawn chairs crammed on the grassy lawns for guests to sunbathe.

This trip was our first stay at the Sheraton and we were a little nervous about it. On paper it doesn't look all that great. The hotel is an enigma is some ways. First off the hotel itself is not that nice. It is a standard 3-3.5 star hotel. The rooms are clean but not fancy. The restaurants at best are just ok. So, why the 5 star rating. Quite frankly this hotel is located on the best location on Maui - either Kaanapali, Kapalua, or Wailea. We stayed in Building 6 and the view from our room was absolutetly stunning - we had whales (even in the off season), turltes, Molokai, Lanai, and even Oahu at night. We could see up the coast as well. The walk to the beach from Building 6 is NOT a big deal. You walk across a bridge, take an elevator up and walk thorugh another building that has absolutely stunning views back towards Kaanapali and Lahaina and then down an elevator. Not a problem at all and we had 4 kids - 8,7,4,2. Having your own parking right in front of the building is great. The layout of the hotel is nice but simple. Lots of open area with grass surronding the pool. I really didn't think my kids would like the pool area that much as there are no slides but they loved it (Not as much as the Grand Wailea but really liked it). I think because of all the winding narrow river like channels they really enjoyed it. We rented a cabana every day and that was great. Excellent service, not Four Seasons level but very friendly. Please note that they do NOT allow you to walk down and use the Westin waterslides and pools anymore. This used to be a perc but is no longer available. Turned out not to be a big deal but the Westin does have the fantastic pool area (We've stayed there 3 times before).. The beach in front of the Sheraton is fantastic. My kids could swim in the sandy area or just move over a little and get out into the snorkle area. Even our 4 year old who couldn't swim could do that. They saw sea turtles every day, which was the highlight of thier trip. We bught a boogie board with a clear glass lens in it for the kids to paddle out and see the fish and it worked great. It wasn't one of the ones they rent with the big plast bubble in it, which don't work. We had to go to the Maui Dive Shop to rent or buy one and it is very worth it. The restuarants were only adequate so we did the quick walk to Whaler's Village most of the time. So, in summary, a complete average hotel on an absolutely stunning piece of property. Absolutely the best location on Maui. Why they didn't upgrade and put a St Regis , W, or upscale Westin on this property is a bit mind numbing becuase if they did it would be one of the nicest tropical hotels in the US.

They offer just about anything a vacationing couple or family could want, but it occasionally comes at a rather stiff price. This was our third trip to Maui, and we liked this property the best of any major hotel where we've stayed previously, though the hospitality maybe wasn't quite as personal. Read on for details... LOCATION: The Sheraton Maui is about 10 minutes north of downtown Lahaina, just off of Route 11 at the end of the Ka'anapali Parkway. Since Route 11 is only 1 lane in each direction heading around the southern coast of West Maui, travel time to/from the main airport in Kahului will vary based on when you go. At best, maybe 40 minutes, and at worst 60 minutes each way. The hotel is about 25 minutes from the boat docks at Ma'alaea, where you can catch fishing, scuba or snorkel boats. Finally, the hotel is about 2.5 hours from the summit of Haleakala -- so if you plan to do the sunrise summit tour, plan on leaving by about 2:30 AM (in the summer) to be sure and arrive before the sun does! PROPERTY: The Sheraton Maui has just about anything you could think of from a beachfront resort. A wide expanse of white sand beach, an enormous rambling freshwater pool (with a mini waterslide), a jacuzzi, a watersports center, a fitness center (up on top of the hill - somewhat hard to find), fantastic snorkeling at Black Rock (lots of turtles), nightly entertainment, multiple restaurants, an outdoor bar, a twice-weekly luau, a huge roster of daily activities and more. The hotel is laid out in a somewhat unusual configuration with buildings 1-4 on the main area around the central pool, and buildings 5 & 6 up above Black Rock. Building 6 does have a very isolated and private feel, but you'll be a rambling walk through other buildings and through at least 2 elevators or stairs to get to the pool area -- it's more than a 5 minute walk to the lobby! The hotel does have many self-park lots, but the lot by the tennis courts (for buildings 3-4) and the lot atop the hill (for buildings 5-6) are almost always full if you pull in after about 8 PM. Valet parking is available, but there is an up-charge of $5 per night after your first (check-in) night. If you're in buildings 3-6 though, it's almost worth it though, because the walk to the larger parking garage on the main road is a ridiculously long one. ROOMS: We had an \"Oceanfront Room\" in Building 4. It must be said that the distinction between \"Oceanview\" and \"Oceanfront\" is a blurry one at best. Oceanfront means that you'll be about 100 feet closer to the beach than Oceanview, but since only a handful of their rooms (on the end of buildings 4, 5 or 6) are actually ocean front, most Oceanfront rooms are just a \"little bit closer ocean view\". Unless you're springing for the Deluxe Oceanfront rooms in Building 6 (with their commensurate long walk), save your cash and go Oceanview -- you'll probably not even notice the difference. The rooms themselves are clean and well-appointed, each with a private lanai. The \"sweet sleeper\" beds are cushy and comfortable, though those with back problems might lament the softness. Pillows were a little thin and pretty much required stacking two together to get a good soft pillow with any kind of neck support. Each room has a wide-screen TV, an alarm clock, a dresser with drawers, a large digital safe, a small refrigerator and wired Internet. Closet space is ok, but in our room it was in the bathroom right behind the door, so accessibility was occasionally annoying. Water pressure was ok but not exceptional. The \"low flow\" heads are environmentally friendly, but they make it a little hard to rinse off the scum of sunblock, bug spray and ocean grit. AMENITIES: FIrst, it must be mentioned that the resort has the now-ubiquitous \"Resort Fee\", which comes to $26.04 per day, including tax, applied daily regardless of what your room rate was, and applicable even if you're paying for part or all of your stay with Starwood points. They claim that this covers amenities that would otherwise be charged for, but this is one of those times where you can pretty much chalk it up to resort extortion. Self-parking is included, but valet is $5 extra per day. Wireless Internet is available in certain public areas, but only wired in the rooms. There is a single computer in the lobby, primarily for airline check-in, but no business center to speak of. There is a watersports activity center on-site, but it is operated by an independent company, and none of the beach activities are included. Most annoyingly, none of the beach accessories (umbrellas, chairs, cabanas, etc...) are available to hotel guests, and must be reserved and rented at a separate charge through an independent company, who will break it down and take it away at the stroke of 5:00 PM, even though beach activities run until about 7. So, effectively, the hotel offers NO beach amenities whatsoever, despite their beachfront location. Poolside chairs and umbrellas are available free to hotel guests, but there is an up-charge for reserving poolside cabanas. Towels are available poolside, on a \"towel card\" system, which means only one towel per person -- so anyone with long hair will want to pull a towel from their room to supplement the poolside offering. The fitness center is well appointed, but was pretty much dead empty the entire time we were there. The likely reason for this is its location in the back of Building 5 atop the hill, which just about nobody would ever find unless you're staying in Building 6. There are tennis courts, with equipment available. In general, just plan on being nickel-and-dimed for anything that isn't a very basic hotel amenity, even after your mandatory resort charge. FOOD: As of May 2009, the Lagoon Bar is currently closed for renovations, though the larger Sundowner Bar is open daily. The terrace restaurant offers a large buffet breakfast each morning from 6:30 through 11:00. The only lunch option is bar-style service at the Sundowner Bar poolside. Dinner is a choice of the Black Rock Steak & Seafood restaurant, or the Teppanyaki restaurant, where Japanese chefs grill the typical soy sauce-heavy hibachi fare. Honestly, if you must stay on-property, you'll do fine with any of these options. But you're better off leaving the property, since there are FANTASTIC west maui restaurants such as Roy's Kahana Grill or Kimo's in downtown Lahaina, where you'll get better food at the same (or less) price. Twice a week, the hotel offers a luau on-property. Avoid it! For a couple of bucks more, you'll enjoy significantly better food, all-night free alcohol, and a better show at the Old Lahaina Luau 10 minutes away on the north end of town. Drinks at the poolside bar are mixed stiff, and are pretty tasty. However, the $12 price for a Mai Tai is a little hard to justify in any way other than \"resort prices\". Have a drink poolside when you're being social, but stop at the local Safeway for drinks or mixers, keep them in your room fridge, and mix your own on your private lanai if you plan to tie on more than one or two! STAFF: The hotel staff was adequate. The room was cleaned daily, requests were handled with accuracy if not amazing speed. I think the hotel is perhaps a bit understaffed, because everyone from the front desk to the poolside bar seems disinterested in personal contact with guests. It's a very mechanical feeling of \"just get it done and move on\"... On the one night where we arrived very late back on-property and the lots nearest our room was full, we'd decided to just valet the car for the $5 charge. The valet was clearly NOT interested in valeting the car for us, and instead spent 5 minutes talking us out of it, and telling us to just park along the driveway in the upper lot, and ignore the \"No Parking - Fire Lane\" signs, since they weren't enforced... Great that he saved us $5, but this sort of encouragement to \"do it yourself\" seemed pretty common among the staff. While they're technically part of a separate company, the on-property watersports and beach equipment vendors were about as UN-accommodating as they came, with little interest in anything other than packing up at the stroke of 5:00 PM. Don't expect overly-personalized service anywhere here. CONCLUSION: Even with all of that said, we really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Maui, and would come back in a heartbeat, if the rate was right. For the prime location and on-site amenities, there is always a cost. If you plan to spend most of your time relaxing on-property, the Sheraton is a top choice. But if you plan to spend most of your time exploring the rest of the island, and spending minimal time on-property, you might want to consider saving the cash and going for a slightly less opulent resort somewhere other than Ka'anapali. For those who do remain, however, your days will be full of sparkling freshwater, crystal blue seas, white sands, huge sea turtles at Black Rock, and all the hula and ukulele you could want. The Sheraton offers great rooms in an unbeatable location.", "Date": "June 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAverage hotel...\u201d", "Author": "Nino84", "ReviewID": "UR31104662", "Content": "We stayed at the Shertaon Maui for 9 nights in May.

We were staying in building 2 - there is a lot of walking involved if you stay at this resort (especially if you are parking your car at the hotel parking lot). The staff were always very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping is not the best (if you are neat freak, you will notice that the bathroom isn't always cleaned properly etc.). The food is not good and very overpriced. If you come from a city with lots of good food (with flavour), you will be disappointed with your food choices at this hotel and in the neighboring area. Don't do the breakfast buffet. It is $25 per person and not worth it. We had it included in our package and wish we hadn't . The buffet at the Westin is much better - so if you do have the breakfast package - eat at the Westin instead. The beach is beautiful - but crowded. You also have to pay for beach chairs $10 per chair and $20 for an umbrella. This is a total rip off. If you are choosing between the Westin Ocean Villas or the Sheraton - choose the villas. The villas are different than the Westin hotel - we didn't see the rooms at the Westin hotel, but I assume they are bit better than Sheraton. We did see the rooms at the Westin Ocean Villas and wished we stayed there instead There are only a few pool chairs with the option of shade (so get there early).

We visited Maui (5/12 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 5/16) and stayed at the Sheraton. We had a fantastic experience starting with check in; it was a breeze. We booked our hotel through Costco Travel and were supposed to have an Ocean View room but were pleasantly surprised when we learned that they were upgrading us to a Deluxe Ocean View room in building 6. After reading many reviews on Trip Advisor, I was going to request building 6, due to the location and quite factor (especially since we were on our anniversary trip). One perk of being in building 6 is that it has its own parking lot. We were easily able to find parking throughout our whole stay. It does require a long walk and a few elevators, but the views are breathtaking and worth it. Once we got to the room we were surprised to see the size and view! As a nice touch, the Sheraton had a nice bottle of champagne waiting for us! We had a king bed and the rooms looked to be recently renovated. There was a separate toilet room for shower and vanity area. We also had a microwave and refrigerator. In addition, we had a great balcony area that overlooked nothing but ocean. We watched a fantastic sunset from our balcony one evening! We ate the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton two of the four mornings and it was good. There was plenty of variety and we were seated at the end of the patio with a great view each morning. One morning we took our breakfast at the Westin because we wanted to check it out. The buffet was definitely comparable to the Sheraton, maybe just more spread out. Both were enjoyable, but we probably wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have paid for it if it wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been included in our rate. The pool at the hotel was great. We lounged around the lazy river and had a blast. The beach is the best in Maui! Black Rock has great snorkeling. I hate to say it, but we saw better fish at Black Rock than on our snorkel trip to Molokini (Maui Classic Charters: Four Winds II morning snorkel to Molokini \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice boat, but we got seasick). We saw several turtles and a variety of fish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right there! As mentioned in separate reviews, we ate at local places around the island. Some highlights include the Hula Pie at Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on the Beach, Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House, Feast at LeLe, Aloha Mixed Plate and sushi at Sansei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (see individual reviews for each in detail). Another tip that we got from Trip Advisor and guide books (Maui Revealed is a great resource) was to stop at Kmart and stock up on drinks and snacks. We did that and also got a fun Hawaii cooler to bring back home with us! We were able to save a lot of money on drinks and souvenirs. There is so much to do in Maui we would recommend staying at least a week and thoroughly exploring the island. In the five days/four nights we were there, we were able to drive the Road to Hana, snorkel at Molokini, snorkel at Black Rock, and explore Lahaina and cruise Front Street a few times.

We were shown to our room by one of the doorman who was nice enough to give us a brief tour of the resort. We stayed in building 6 which are their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Deluxe Ocean Front\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Rooms. We requested a specific range of rooms because we wanted our view to be of the black rock, but we were not given a room, in that area, nor were we given a reason as to why we could not be in that area. We found that to be a little unprofessional but it was no big deal as we saw that the room that we had been given had an amazing view and was nice and clean. The hotel also gave us a complementary bottle of champagne which was a nice gesture considering this stay was for our honeymoon. The Resort: The location of the Sheraton Maui is incredible. The beach is pristine, the grounds are perfectly manicured and the general environment is just beautiful. For those who wish to stay in building 6 the walk is not too long if you are relatively young and in good health. It was however a little confusing trying to get to the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153main resort area\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because you have to go across, and then take an elevator down. It was a little much but I think being in a room that is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153away from it all\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is worth it. The Restaurants: Our first morning there we ate at the Keki\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Terrace for their breakfast buffet. It was pretty good, no complaints at all about the food\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6however, the BIRDS were just too much for me. I am sorry but at one point the birds were just jumping on our tables and fighting for food. The staff there at the restaurant must be pretty used to this but I was really shocked at the number of birds that were just flying all around and scouting for our food. We also tried the Black Rock Restaurant. It is funny because while we were looking around the resort the first day, I wanted to see the restaurants because I can be quite a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153food snob\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lol so I like to get an idea of how a restaurant look before I dine\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6but as much as we looked around I told my husband that I noticed that we did not see the Black Rock Restaurant. I did not think much of it until the next evening when we taking a stroll, we decided to go back to Keki\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Terrace and to our surprise after we were seated we were given a menu that said Black Rock Restaurant! Basically this one restaurant doubled as a breakfast spot in the morning and a Steakhouse at night under different names. Anywho, the food was just ok. I ordered a Filet Mignon and received something that looked like a glorified skirt steak. I am from Chicago and I know a good steak. For what we paid I would have rather grabbed a fish taco (which are divine) from a fast food restaurant. We also tried the TeppenYaki Dan which was really good with great presentation. Tips/Misc. Info I would definitely rent a car for Maui. We were able to explore the island which saved money when compared to paying for a tour bus excursion. Make sure you see the sunrise!! We actually set this up through the hotel because the roads can be very winding and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very dark up there but it was sooo worth it. We took pictures that look like something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d see on a postcard! If you take this trip, dress in layers and warmly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very cold and windy up on the mountain which you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be over 10,000 feet above sea level. My last tip would be to get in your rented car and go to the abc store or better yet the local grocery and buy some water, juice, pop, fruit etc. This saved us a bundle.

It's beautiful, it's clean, and if you can get in building 5 or six, you probably have some of the best views on this side of the island.. it was OUTstanding. We went with very high expectations of the hotel, and the vacation in general, and almost all of them were exceeded. The ONLY reason they got 4 out of 5 for me, was a combination of two things.. the beginning when they booked my husband and I in a room with double beds, and when they in our opinion, didn't do a great job with coordinating events on the lawn, which prevented us from finishing watching \"The Dark Knight\" on the lawn for their movie nights do to too much sound overlap and the movie having to be turned down to a level only dogs could hear in order to accomodate the other \"paying\" events. Our room was booked through Travelocity. Now, we're not sure if Travelocity made the error or the hotel did. I found myself annoyed primarily with the hotel simply because I had called them a month in advance to confirm that our hotel reservations had made it there, and to let them know we were honeymooners (sometimes they do special things for honeymooners). Obviously they got the info, cause we got shell leis when we arrived and there was a box of chocolates and champagne waiting in our room. SO, to put us in double beds seemed ridiculous and annoyed me. The front desk woman's indifference to my being upset didn't help matters. To their credit, we were upgraded a room, and on the 3rd night got moved into their first available room with a King in building 6. It's a building that takes a little walk to get to, but it's well worth it. There is a trash facility on the walk, so that can be a little downer, but the rooms over here are BEAUTIFUL.. and by that I really mean the view out of them. It's just amazing, and quiet. Building 5 is located on this same side of black rock, and I imagine the views there are nearly as good. (Clearly, ours will always be the best). All in all, we loved it.

The room itself was spacious for 4 people and had a fairly good view of the beach and the ocean. Service was fair. On one occasion we returned to our room at 4pm to find that we had had no maid service at all. When I phoned to find out why, I was told that they probably had not gotten to our room \"yet\". We felt the resort went out of there way to add additional charges, for example to use a covered lounge chair on the beach the cost is an exorbitant $40 per day. We had one meal poolside-again the service was poor, waiting 45minutes for a very dried out, very small hot dog-the prices were way overpriced for the quality.

We never at the hotel otherwise, so can't comment on the food for lunch or dinner. The Westin hotel breakfast was also nice, and a bit more expansive, which was included as an option with our breakfast package. The fitness room is nice. We had convenient parking right by our room. The staff is overall very helpful and responsive. The concierge was average. I wanted to find some surfing lessons, and of course, she was steering me towards the business Sheraton had a link with. I might've found someone cheaper had I searched on my own. I also asked her about Italian restaurants, and she didn't even know about the italian place nearby! Well anyway, I guess any hotel is going to steer you towards their preferred vendors, so always a good idea to do your own research. Our internet was out for an hour and they gave us a $25 certificate, which was nice. Timeshare reps are lurking but not particularly aggressive. We opted for this place instead of a 5 star property such as Grand Waileia or Ritz....it had everything you would want, it was well maintained property, and substantially cheaper.

My husband and I are in our late 20's and we were looking for a relaxing vacation to unwind after the big wedding. The Sheraton was just that. First of all the location of the resort was right at the very end of the main strip of resorts. The tourist foot traffic was almost non existent by the time you got down there which made for a very peaceful environment. In my opinion the beach space in front of the Sheraton was by far the best out of all the resorts. It was definitely the largest as some resorts barely had room to set up a chair in the sand. Also there was a jetty of large rocks that formed off to the side and I heard there was great snorkeling right in front of the hotel by the rocks (I wouldn't know personally because I am a bit afraid of the ocean!) A \"Tikki Man\" also did a charming traditional performance every night by lighting torches from the hotel to the end of the jetty, and then cliff diving off of it (see pictures!). The rooms were nothing too special. However they were clean, beds were comfortable and bathrooms were covered in granite and very large which is always a plus. We actually checked into a room with two double beds (not the most ideal set up for a honeymoon!) so we went right back to the front desk and were changed to a different room with a King no problem. The Sheraton Pools were really nice, they had a couple big ones with fun little river channels that you could swim through to get from one to the other. Service at the pool was very attentive, our Mai Tai's were always filled! Even though we were looking for some relaxation for the most part - we are in our 20's and we did want to seek out some additional action once we were rested up. I will say that the Sheraton becomes a ghost town around 8pm! There is absolutely nothing to do or see so we had to walk down to the other resorts and Whalers Village if we wanted to hear any music, or find entertainment of any kind for that matter. I highly recommend the Hula Grill (right next to Whalers Village) they had live music every night and their tables and chairs sat right in the sand! Once you get your fill of the resort strip a trip to Lahaina is a must. The Sheraton had a very nice free shuttle that went to and from the town on an hourly basis. Lahaina is such a charming place right on the beach with a ton of restaurants and shops. I used to live there and Kimo's is hands down the best place to catch a drink and a bite to eat! Make sure to make a reservation!

I love to look for deals and really get into the vacation months before we actually leave. I did a lot of research on the resorts in Maui and made resevations at the Sheraton Maui resort and spa. I am a Starwood member and I used their website to book our stay. At the last minute I found a internet special that gave us an partial ocean view for $240.00 a night, so I changed our reservation.

I woke up to my wife opening the curtains and the first thing she said was \" its beautiful\". I knew then that I made the right choice. The room looked to be newly renovated with a flat screen T.V. and new carpet. The lanai was very narrow but the view of the grounds, beach, and ocean made up for it. We broused the room service menu and had to laugh at $18.00 for a bowl of cream of wheat with brown sugar and raisins. Needless to say we never ate at the resort. We did run into many people who had the breakfast coupons and loved the buffet in the mornings. The resort employees were never rude and always helpful. We chose to pay the extra $5 and use the valet service. We never regretted it. We noticed that every morning people from the other resorts would carry there things down to the beach in front of the Sheraton because by far its the best beach. I snorkeled at black rock and saw turtles, many fish, squid. It was very beautiful. Our best meal was shared with a couple we met at the resort. We ate at Kimo`s in Lahaina town. We made our resevations so that we could enjoy the sunset. All in all I loved the Sheraton and I loved Maui.

My wife and I stayed at the Sheraton Maui for 8 nights at the end of January, 2009 for our 25th anniversary. We booked a vacation package through Pleasant Holidays that included the daily breakfast buffet (I recommend getting breakfast vouchers included in your package) and an upgrade to deluxe oceanfront in building 6, on Black Rock. We parked our rental car in the private lot for building 6 each night. (Note: \"Building 6\" is actually a string of 3 attached buildings. We were originally placed in the third building (6318) which had a beautiful oceanfront view of Molokai. However, after 1 night, we requested and were graciously given a room in the first building (rooms 6301-6310) on the tip of Black Rock, in clear view of the cliff divers from our balcony. EVERYDAY we could see Molokai, Lanai, many whales, a rare monk seal, sea turtles, many ships, sunsets, etc from our room. It was stunningly beautiful. We had had a relaxing and scenic 6 minute walk from building 6 to the pool and dining area each day. The breakfast buffet included fresh fruit, eggs, meats, numerous pastries, a made to order omelet bar with a chef, pancakes, oatmeal, fresh pineapple juice, and much more. It was a great way to start the day. The Resort was not crowded this time of the year, so we rarely had to wait for a table. The service was commendable. We had one piece of luggage that was lost - the airport staff drove it to our hotel and the the Sheraton staff had it in our room by noon the next day! Our room was cleaned daily, and the resort staff was very friendly and accommodating without exception. The Sheraton has a large amount of acreage, and has expansive lawns with tiki torches, palms, a coi pond, a large pool with a long, meandering floating river with waterfalls. It is not heated, but great for sunbathing next to and taking mid-afternoon dips. Dining is expensive, so we mainly ate our free breakfast there. However, we had one evening dinner there that was delicious, and we were given a complimentary dessert pie for our anniversary (the chef wrote our names on the plate and Happy 25th Anniversary with frosting.) The bar offers happy hour from 3-5 with live music each night, and has good burgers. The resort offered free weekly: stargazing (great), pilates, hula lessons, ukalele lessons, free scuba/snorkeling lessons, family movie night, nightly ceremonial cliff dive off Black Rock (we saw it twice). The resort is relaxing and has a feel of true, lush Hawaii, more so than the more opulent, upscale Hyatt or hotel-feeling Westin. Kaanapali Beach is a great beach during the winter. The water is more calm and area is less windy than Kapalua. The snorkeling at Black Rock is very nice, and the beach is long with lots of fine sand to lay on. You can rent a chair or cabana on the beach, but most people opted for the good ol' towel to lay on, and sunned on a free lounge chair at the pool. In winter, we had no problem getting a lounger by the pool at anytime. We ate a few meals at Whalers Village, just a short, relaxing walk on the concrete boardwalk along the beach. Leilani's has a dinner special from 5-6pm nightly that was $15 per person for the main course. Everthing in Maui is a la carte, so we added a dinner salad for $8. We ate at the Hard Rock cafe in Lahaina - Lahaina was a great place to shop and browse during a day we had rain. We took the Teralani Whale watch tour from 4-6pm right off Kaanapali Beach - we saw many whales - a group of four right off the side of the boat. We drove the road to Hana with Valley Isle Excursions. The tour guide grew up there and knew her stuff! We saw many waterfalls and beautiful sights (it rained some, but the 7 sacred pools were flowing!) The road around the back of the island was open, so we traveled around the entire south side of the island and back in 12 hours! They offered a continental breakfast and a nice chicken lunch. I recommend you take a tour the first trip to Hana - the road has some very dangerous, narrow spots over cliffs, so the driver MUST focus on the road and not sightsee. Plus, the guide knows the best spots to stop, and does not waste time finding them. I would feel comfortable driving myself the second time we go to Hana. I did golf at Kapalua - Plantation Golf Course, a real highlight of the trip! They have a half-price twilight rate after 1:30pm. Reserve your tee time well in advance online. The Plantation GC has a great restaurant with a great view and reasonable price for lunch. My wife had a manicure and shopped at the Westin while I was golfing - the spa at the Sheraton is being remodeled, and is almost finished. We did relax by the pool at the Sheraton and hang out on our lanai often. We did not pack in too many daily activities - we were able to unwind and relax a lot on this trip with a true sense of being in Hawaii - that is what the Sheraton is best for! It was the perfect anniversary vacation for us - don't hesitate to stay there - it is paradise.

Our offer was $739 for 5 nights in a garden view room, $75 in hotel certificates and $185 towards an Avis rental car. When we checked in, we were upgraded to an ocean view room for no extra charge. However, when we checked out the room (3134 on the ground level of building three), we heard an elevator noise and opted to switch rooms. We ended up paying an additional $75 per night for a higher level ocean view room in building four (4036). Definitely worth the extra money for a superb view. The front desk also threw in a complimentary bottle of champagne. I'll briefly list the positives and negatives of our stay to help anyone out who may be considering staying here. This was our 6th trip to Maui and probably our 15th trip to Hawaii so I feel I have a fair amount of other experiences to compare this one with. Positives: 1. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! The setting in front of Black Rock is stunning. You've got fabulous snorkeling and diving right there. In addition to colorful fish, we saw octopus, eels, turtles, squid and a white tip reef shark all around Black Rock. Since the Sheraton is the last hotel in the string of main Kaanapali hotels it feels a little more peaceful and less busy than some of the other hotels. However, it's no more than a ten minute walk to Whaler's Village for restaurants and shopping. 2. Beach: The beach is wide with plenty of sand for everyone here. In front of the Westin and parts of the Marriott Ocean Club it's eroded significantly. In fact, the concrete walking path has washed away, too, in parts. The water in front of the Sheraton is free of sea grass and debris, beautifully clear. The water in the eroded areas was murky looking and very churned up. 3. Employees: I'd read a few reviews of the Sheraton where people complained of apathetic or even rude employees. Not our experience at all. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Even the cleaning staff gave a smile and an \"Aloha\" greeting when we'd walk by in the hall. 4. A timeshare invite, but no pressure: We were offered a 90 minute presentation for an additional $100 in certs and 7,500 Starwood pts. We declined and that was the end of it. 5. Fitness Center: Clean, new equipment. Space was roomy and clean. 6. Sundowner Bar at the pool: Happy hour daily at 3:00. Lunches we ordered here we're really good and fairly generous portions. Fish and chips was delicious. 7. A1 Scuba: I got my open water certification at the resort through A1 scuba. Super communication ahead of time to set it up, and my instructor was patient and a great teacher. Highly recommend them. Room for Improvement: Check in: The hotel is currently remodeling the check in area so check in was at a makeshift desk with two employees on laptops. Employees were friendly, but the computers seemed very slow and I felt bad for others who were waiting behind us for probably 10 mins. 2. Rooms: Looking a little tired. First room they put us in had a big splotch of paint on the bathroom counter. Blowdryer in bathroom was very dirty with dust, makeup, etc.. Bed was comfy, but they put a down comforter on the bed, no blanket. Why would you want a down comforter in Hawaii? We requested a blanket instead which was perfect with the AC on. 3. Pool: Seemed a little small for a large hotel. We enjoyed it, but if they ever do another major remodel I'd suggest expanding the pool area and using some of the lawn area for pool instead. 4. Wow Factor: The Sheraton is a nice hotel, but if you're looking for extravagance you won't find it here. The Wow factor for me is in the location, not the property itself. 5. Soundproofing: If you're sensitive to noise, I'd bring earplugs for sleeping. The hallway outside our room backed up to black rock and I think the acoustics are such that you hear people walking, wheeling their luggage, etc.. Also, the people in the room above us seemed to be moving furniture one night...very noisy. I'd recommend this property to anyone looking for a hotel with the best location on Kaanapali. If the beach is not a priority for you, and you'd prefer a better pool, consider the Westin instead. Last, we were into inexpensive dining on this trip so we could put our money into activities. I'll post separate restaurant reviews, but definitely look into the following restaurants for tasty, inexpensive (by Maui standards) food: Honokowai Okazuya, Gazebo, Cilantro, Barefoot Grill (at Hula Grill), and even the food court at Whaler's village. We shared a pizza and a Greek salad there that was pretty decent for a food court. Overall, fabulous experience at the Sheraton and a great value for the money. We'll be back!", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Wales - United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA honeymoon in paradise!\u201d", "Author": "Kiggins", "ReviewID": "UR23688944", "Content": "Our stay at the Sheraton Maui was the second part of our three part honeymoon. Booked to have a relaxing week in the sun, away from the British rain! We absolutely LOVED the Sheraton! We arrived early evening and as soon as we checked in (short wait) we were congratulated on our wedding and were given beautiful leis. A lot better than the ones we paid for at the airport! Within minutes of arriving in our room a bottle of chilled champagne and flutes arrived to help us celebrate our honeymoon. A lovely touch. We booked a garden view room, which was private, not overlooked and we had views of Maui mountain and banana trees. The room was very large with 2 Queen Size beds, a nice bathroom, large wardrobe, a fridge and a safe. Everything we needed. It was air conditioned and controlled by us which was great. The balcony was quite small but big enough for what we needed. Who goes to Maui to stay in their rooms?! The hotel and its grounds were spotlessly clean and tidy. There appeared to be an army of gardeners our in force everyday, there wasn't even a blade of grass out of place! The pool was very quiet, we swam daily, faultless. The beach in front of the hotel was again very clean. We rented snorkels (very expensive to do from the hotel, cheaper in Whalers Village) and swam with Turtles at Black Rock. Photos of which our friends and family all think are postcards they are so close and so clear. There is a very strong current at this beach which could be dangerous for weak swimmers and children. The restaurants and pool bar at the hotel were adequate. We ate at both and were not disappointed. But it was ideal that Whalers village were only a short walk away to eat in different places. Also the free shuttle bus into Lahaina every hour was brilliant and we really took advantage of it and ate locally. We heard a lot of American tourists complaining about the prices of food and drink, but being British we found it all quite reasonable, actually cheaper than expected considering most things are imported. We booked a number of trips with the poolside concierge, service was excellent. A must was the Waterfall Hike, absolutely amazing!

I purposely planned it so that our last days will be at the best hotel so we can relax and do nothing. As we hopped from one island to the next, Maui was our last stop and we certainly felt we needed the time to relax. We arrived at the hotel less than an hour before 3pm and was told that our room was not ready. However, we were offered complimentary drinks and food coupons at the bar and would be notified when our room was ready. They even had complimentary first night valet parking! What great service! We enjoyed our cocktails by the pool and were notified that our room was ready just before 3pm. We got someone to help us with our bags (which they already took out from the car and put on the cart for us) and we were given fresh leis which made me feel so special and Hawaiian. Not only that, because it's our honeymoon, we got a bottle of wine! We had booked an ocean view room and the view was just spectacular from the lanai. I can just go back any minute! The room was very nice with a flat-screen TV and complimentary high speed internet. The cool thing with the TV is that you can order room service, set up the alarm etc. The only minor issue we had was tiny ants in the washroom. The hotel also offers shuttle buses every hour to Lahaina which is great because it would be hard and expensive to park in town. We also visited the concierge and received a free package of postcards! Remember also that there are activities during the day. We learned to make our own leis which was fun. The cliff dive at the Black Rock at sunset was very unique and special as well. One day, we were locked out of our room despite trying a few times with our electronic key so we called for help. Someone came within a few minutes to open the door for us. Apparently, the \"key\" that we had was the parking key and not the room key. However, we were never told. The other thing I'm impressed with the hotel is that they allow you to use their facilities after check-out. Most flights out of Hawaii is at night and ours was at 11:30pm so we had a full 8-9 hours after check-out. We stored our bags and then we chilled by the pool, beach and the lobby and took showers in the fitness centre before leaving the hotel. We really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton. Although this was the most expensive hotel we paid on our trip, it was worth every penny.

This hotel, while acceptable in most ways, left my husband & I disappointed. It wasn't such a bad experience that it ruined our vacation, but we did frequently find ourselves talking about just how disappointed we were with our hotel. Not exactly what you want in a vacation! The Sheraton is listed as a 4-star hotel. As such, I didn't expect every amenity and luxury imaginable, but certainly expected more than what was offered, especially in light of the daily \"resort fee.\" It was apparent that this hotel wasn't quite the same quality as other 4-star places we've visited. It was mostly the little things that they didn't get quite right. For instance, I continue to feel a little annoyed that it seems every other hotel in Hawaii, except this one, greets guests with a flower lei! The staff seemed fairly average in terms of helpfulness or local knowledge. The car valet was fairly slow and front desk was inefficient. There were some stand-outs, however. The bellhops: unlike many other places, these didn't have their hands out at all times. Also, the woman who presented the night-stargazing with a telescope did a nice job (if you do stay at the Sheraton, be sure to go down to the lawn for that). We paid for an upgrade to an Ocean Front Room. We expected a better view and nicer room, or at least one that was, well, in FRONT of the OCEAN. Instead, it was in front of a large lawn, which was in front of a pool, in front of a cabana, in front of a hedge, in front of a beach, in front of the ocean. Yes, the ocean was probably in front of us but not exactly the view to the ocean I had in mind. The room did have a mini-fridge, big TV, safe, and fairly comfy bed. The bathroom wasn't well ventilated and was kinda small. Our patio was tiny - not even enough space for us both to sit there,and no privacy. The internet access in the rooms was wired only. At least the lawn was pretty - lush green like everything else in Ka'anapali (and most of Maui, too). Parking was not really adequate, and spaces were really tight. The grounds are laid out oddly, so we walked a lot (and got lost a bit, too). We didn't try the pool (seemed to have more kids than expected) but did enjoy the hot tub. Several other reviewers have commented on the beach and the sunset torch-lighting at Black Rock. Both of those are nice (though we actually didn't ever swim at this beach -- the beaches in South Maui seemed better for swimming). But, remember, ANYBODY can go to the beach and view the sunset ceremony - even if you stay at another hotel! Also, if you are a member of the Starwood guest program, be aware that if you book thru another website (we booked thru Expedia), you won't get any points for your stay. We probably should have known that, but the conceriege wasn't exactly helpful when we asked, either. The hotel is on a nice part of Ka'anapali beach. Ka'anapali is very pretty with good views to off-shore islands, but we found ourselves driving a lot (at least into Lahaina, if not much farther) for meals and activities. Overall, there weren't tremendous problems with this hotel - things seemed a little old but in good repair, adequately cleaned, etc. Our main complaint that it wasn't the quality we expected. We paid for \"special\" but got \"merely adequate.\" When we return to Maui, we won't stay at the Sheraton. It doesn't live up to other 4* Hawaiian hotels, nor other Sheratons we've stayed at. Ka'anapali is a decent location, but if we choose that area again, we'd definitely pick another hotel - and maybe one with a better price tag (saving some of our vacation money for 2+ nights at the Hotel Hana-Maui).", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beverly Hills", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best beaches in the islands and a wonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Tahoskibum", "ReviewID": "UR23228368", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel on five different occasions and was shocked to read some of the recent negative reviews. The fact is that this hotel sits on one of the best beaches on the Hawaiian Islands. The only other beaches that fit into the same category would be the Mauna Kea Beach Resort (the best hotel in the islands, and the Royal Hawaiian). We stayed in an Ocean Front (which doesn't mean that you are right on the water, rather just that you have a view from both the bed and patio). It was very nice, the bed was very comfortable (although not a pillowtop) and the furniture was in excellant condition. The room comes with a small fridge which is nice because you can stop at the Costco right next to the airport and buy drinks/water (which saves you from having to pay for drinks every few hours at the hotel). The staff were delightful (with the execption of only one concierge member). I think that the people writing negative reviews aren't used to the high prices of the islands versus what you get in the islands. The same could be said of Americans who first travel to Europe. Most Americans expect that if you are paying $300+ for a room that you should get one of the most unbelievable rooms you could ever imagine. This is true of most places in the mainland U.S. But in Hawaii if you want a \"knock your socks off\" amazaing room then you are going to have to spend in the $600 per/night range. $300-$350 gets you a very nice room and experience but its not going to be anything close to ultimate luxury. That's just the way it is on the islands. I am a realy brat and demand a nice, clean room with good amenities. But I'm also realistic and know what things cost in the areas that I'm traveling. The Sheraton Maui is a beautiful resort and I guarantee that you will have an amazaing \"beach\" experience. If you want a truely deluxe experience then you might be better off at a Four Seasons or Wilea Resort where you will pampered and spending a lot more. The snorkling at this beach is amazing and when you go around the Black Rock point in the morning you can almost always expect to see at least 5 large turtles. At about 3-4pm each day many of the turtles actually come right into the beach and swim right next to the beachgoers. As far as building #6 rooms, its true that they are a little walk to the main building (which you really don't need to go to too much anyway). But they have amazing views and are much quieter than the main resort rooms. Much more romantic if you are on a honeymoon. They are not at all far from the beach/pool area.

It would have probably been better to leave those fond memories alone because our recent stay was just average. We were hoping for an upgraded room given it was our honeymoon and my husbands gold starwood status. We got our wish - an oceanview room. However, oceanview was really garden view by my definition. We were in the building just north of the lobby on the second floor. It overlooks the restaurant and the garden, the pool, and way in the background is the ocean. Beautiful, yes. But not enough of a reason to sit on the lanai. The room was also a double. Not exactly a recipe for romance. The only single they could offer us was oceanfront, which by their definition of views most likely means you have to lean over the balcony to see any water, and was also on the first floor. I recalled from my first stay, geckos really like to get in the rooms, so we declined the first floor and went with the double. The bathroom was a pretty tight fit and I felt claustrophobic in the shower. Plus the tub looked like it could use a recaulking. But it was clean and otherwise very average. We splurged on valet. At only $5 a night it's a steal compared to how you'll be gouged by the rest of the island. The valet service was pretty great. Fast and friendly. The wireless internet NEVER worked in the room. Ok, that's a bit harsh. It would work for about 15 seconds. Long enough for me to connect, but not long enough to open a webpage. We weren't able to connect using the ethernet cable either. Housekeeping was the worst I've experienced in a while. We stay a total of 9 nights and only once did we receive new soap. And I'm certain that one time we did get soap, it was because our regular housekeeper took Christmas Eve off and we had someone new. I had to resort to robbing the housekeeping cart for a bar of soap every other day. Dirty dishes also sat in our room for three days until Christmas Eve. They also cleaned the rooms pretty late. A few instances we would leave early in the morning (6-8am) and return late in the afternoon (2-4pm) and find the room still had not been cleaned. Black rock was the main reason I had loved this hotel the first time around. There was nothing like starting out the day hopping in the ocean for some snorkeling. Unfortunately, the snorkeling was not as good this time around. There are not nearly as many fish, probably because feeding is no longer allowed. Plus, it's far too crowded and with people jump off the cliff every couple of minutes, I kept getting paranoid I was swimming to close and was about to get knocked out by a cliff diver. If you like to snorkel like I do, stay in Wailea. The hotel was not terrible. It was clean and provided the standard comforts you should expect from a Sheraton. But it was not a luxury hotel. It was priced far less than other options, so I guess you get what you pay for.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at the Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "newcomel", "ReviewID": "UR23049713", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton the week before Christmas.

Our room felt private and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see or hear anyone else. The parking was easy as the key to get in/out of the lot was used. The pool was nice. People do start reserving chairs early- 8 AM or sooner. The pool staff does come around with wristbands each day to signal who is a hotel guest.

The beach is just steps away and we enjoyed renting a cabana for one day. The hotel staff was great at setting this up and in picking out a great beach spot. The rental is kind of pricey-- $40 a day. The only restaurant we ate at was the Sundowner bar for lunches. We found the food to be decent, although a little expensive but very convenient. The portions were huge so we ended up splitting a lunch. The coffee stand in the lobby area also serves excellent Kona coffee. There is so much to do in the area.

I am 26 and my husband is 31. This was our first trip to Maui and we are Starwood Preferred members, so we booked directly with SPG for a rate of $330/night for partial oceanview (breakfast included). We have stayed in 5-star resorts before, but also do just fine in a Hampton Inn. My opinions and reviews are usually based on if I think the property was a good value for the money and if it met our expectations for the price we paid. Overall, I do not think the Sheraton is worth the money. If you want the luxuries, I would suck it up and pay the extra $100/night to stay at Fairmont Kea Lani. If you do not need the extra luxuries, I would save the extra money and stay in a condo. I would have been happier doing either of these options instead of the Sheraton. I will go into details below. Check-in: We were greeted with leis and check-in was seamless. We were upgraded to deluxe oceanfront (building 6). I read complaints about the commute from building 6 to the beach, but we decided to give it a try. The staff was very friendly. Rooms: We were in room 6410. It was really quiet and the walk to other parts of the resort was really not bad. However, I could see it would be a pain if you had kids or had mobility issues. The room was well-appointed and quite large. There was a mini-fridge and microwave. However, the mini-fridge was not on when we checked in. We did not find this out until we went to put a few items from Safeway in the fridge. It took more than 12 hours to cool down. I have never stayed in a hotel that did not have the refrigerator turned on for guests. This was annoying. When it finally did cool down, it never really got cold. We had deli meat, a pack of cheese, a small bottle of mustard, 2 bottles of water, and 2 beers. It was not full by any means. I would not keep milk in the fridge. Housekeeping was good and they replaced coffee and shower amenities daily. The view from our balcony was gorgeous! But, there was not an outside light. This was also another tiny negative, but it became a little irritating when we wanted to enjoy the view in the evenings. Sunset was between 5:45 and 6:00 pm. There are robes in the rooms to use, which were great Breakfast: Breakfast was included in our room rate and we were given coupons for each day we were there. The buffet offers a wide variety, but it pretty much stays the same everyday. I was a little disappointed in the fruit, because I thought the fruit would be really fresh with a good variety of tropical fruit. It was not that great-pineapple, cantaloupe, papaya, and strawberries. However, they had a great selection of fruit juices- I especially loved the guava juice. The pastries were really good, especially the banana bread. On the first day, they said they alternate the special stations every 3 days- omelets, waffles, and crepes. However, they only had the omelet station for the 6 days we were there. The buffet was around $23.95 and I would not have paid for it if not included in the rate. I would have kept a box of pop-tarts or pastries in the room. Pool/Beach: The pool and the beach are both great. We always got good seats at the pool, but we were usually down there by 8:30 am, since we were on east coast time. The resort was only 60% full and I bet it is a pain to get pool chairs when it is busy. The servers were friendly. The drinks and food were expensive, but that was expected. The cheapest thing to order for lunch was a basket of fries ($8). Tropical drinks were $10. Happy hour was 3-5 pm and they had pretty reasonable specials ($5 margaritas, $4 beers). We only had lunch by the pool once and we split the chicken parmesan wrap. ($15) It was big and pretty good. We usually had a couple drinks a day and they were always good. They only had one Jacuzzi, and I think a resort this size should have more than that. Also, the floats for the lazy river were $5/hour or $10/day. We did not rent them. Resort Charge: I knew about the resort charge in advance and was ok with it. However, I think they still nickel and dime you. I do not think you should have to rent a float for the lazy river if you are paying a resort charge. I think they need to pick one or the other. Also, there is not a computer to use with internet access. They have free wi-fi access included in the resort charge, but we did not want to lug our laptop to Maui. I think it is ridiculous to say they are a 4 star resort and not offer a computer with internet access. They do have a Mac in the lobby to print off boarding passes. Other: The shuttle service to Lahaina was always prompt and the driver always friendly. The grounds were beautiful. The spa was still not open, even though their sign says Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa. You can use the one at the Westin, though.

The parking valet guys were also terrific, and were always ready and willing with recommendations and/or directions. The staff at the front desk though, was another story. In particular, there was this one short and stout woman with shoulder length brown hair that appeared to really hate her job and made it clear that it was like pulling teeth if you presented her with anything but a credit card. On our first day, they had accidently given us an incorrect room (double bed instead of king), and she indicated that no king beds were available for the duration of our entire stay and to call Travelocity if we were dissatisfied (How strange? What hotel sends you back to a booking agent?). Being that we spent alot of money on the trip to Hawaii and were there for a romantic getaway, we were naturally confused and upset - especially since it was a slow period (between Thanksgiving and Christmas) and didn't know how they could possibly not have excess capacity or offer to upgrade us if need be to honor the bed type in the reservation. Nonetheless, we trucked up to our room and the valet brought our bags. I think he noticed our dissapointment, bc he asked us what was the matter, and within minutes he had the correct room.

Great location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it seems the hotel has the largest area of beach (the other hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s front a much narrower stretch of beach) and they have great snorkeling right off of Black Rock. Additionally, it is a short drive to Lahania (5 minutes). Nice pool \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pool was clean and offers both a kid friendly area and an adult friendly area. There is no swim up bar, but waitresses make rounds around the pool area. Food Quality \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the food is expensive, but we were pleased with the quality. The mixed drinks were good as well. The fish and chips by the pool is really tasty and can be split because it is such a large serving. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about $15. Room Balcony \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the balconies are very spacious and we had a wonderful view of the ocean from building 2. Resort Charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the resort charge is about $20 per day and we felt that this was fair given the fact that we had a car the entire length of our stay and we used the internet.

They seemed bothered when we talked to them. Service on the Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you are not allowed to drink on the beach so there are no waitresses. Also, lounge chairs on the beach must be rented ($10 per chair, $20 for an umbrella, and $50 for a cabana style lounge seating).

There is no internet access at all at this resort (except to print out boarding passes); they sent us a few resorts down to the Westin where there are computers you can use with your credit card.

Pros: - Ample parking close to our tower - Well insulated rooms, very quiet - Couples Friendly - Fridge was a life saver - Location, location, location - Breakfast Buffet was our best meal on the island - Friendly bartenders made great drinks - Discreet Housekeeping Cons: - Annoying daily call to visit the Starwoods Vacations desk (timeshares) - Coffee stand was a total ripoff ($4 for a Yoplait Yogurt?!) - Poolside food was expensive and quality was blah - Could use more pillows - Beach Cabana service should include Ice Bucket If we stay in Kaanapali again I would definitely consider the Sheraton again.", "Date": "October 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, ca", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "collins26050", "ReviewID": "UR20812179", "Content": "We stayed at Sheraton Maui 9/27 - 10/4 and loved it. We've previously stayed at Kaanapali Beach Hotel, Westin, Sands of Kahana and Aston Kaanapali Shores. The Sheraton is now our favorite. Second favorite is Kaanapali Beach Hotel. After an initial problem with our reservation, my husband had a talk with the manager and they upgraded us to an ocean view. We were thrilled as this was a special trip for us. We were renewing our vows on our 15th wedding anniversary. They send a bottle of champagne to the room when we told them about the special occasion. The room was very nice - large, with a very comfortable bed. Lanai was also pretty good size. Yes, the food is pricey. We only ate one meal there - the Prime ib dinner buffet. The dinner was okay - no great but not bad either. The pool was fantastic - it had a long winding river from an upper pool to a lower pool and a small slide. Lots of space around the pools for the loungers. Large grassy area next to the buildings was nice and gave an open feel to the place. The Lagoon Bar was good with good food and drinks. The first night we sat at the bar, watched the sunset with the cliff diver lighting the tiki torches on black rock. After he dived off of Black Rock, a fire dancer danced in front of us at the bar. Black Rock which has excellent snorkeling if right in front of the hotel. We sat on the beach frequently throughout the week. You can rent a cabana for $40 or umbrella for $20 & lounges for $10 each. After 1:30, the rental is half price. It is also a very close walk to Whaler's Village where we went several times for lunch and dinner. The Sheraton also has a shuttle to Whaler's Village and one to Lahaina as well. The location can't be beat with Lahaina in one direction and Napili and Kapalua the other direction.

It was bit of a bummer when we checked into our hotel room to find out that the bed we requested for was not available. They said nothing is guaranteed through Expedia. Again, Expedia's fault! I would have rated excellent for this hotel, but we didn't have a King size bed right away. We requested a King size bed, but they only had a room with 2 double size beds available for us. It was either we take that and get upgraded to the Mountain view from the the Garden view, or we pay an additional $300 plus a night for a room with a King size bed. What was even more frustrating, we were on our honeymoon, and they weren't the least concerned with our situation. So, we had to stick it out with the double beds for two nights. It was nice, but too small for us to sleep comfortably. Finally, we were put in a king size bedroom but downgraded back to the Garden view room. Sooooo much better! Not only was it bigger, it was closer to the beach (we were on the bottom floor), and closer to the parking garage (we rented a car so we were constantly in and out). After that, our stay in the hotel was much much better =) We went to the Kaanapali beach everyday (so convenient) and snorkling right next to Black Rock. We even saw very huge and friendly turtles! They just practically swim right next to you. We went to Lahaina to eat. Cute town. It's about a 10 minute drive or less away. Try Aloha Mixed Plate (great local food and reasonably priced) and Cheeseburgers in Paradise (sooo good). Also, if you love sushi, you definitely have to go to Sansei Seafood Restaurant in Kihei (make a reservation first because it gets really packed in there during their 25% sushi, appetizers, and entrees hour). We also went to the Old Lahaina Luau (worth the money...great show and great food). Just please don't use Expedia! Too many problems with them and pointless. No guarantees and poor customer service! I called the night that we encountered or problems, and they blamed us instead for not checking with the hotel to make sure we have the room requested as well as not making sure we have our flights confirmed.

We called and they reduced the price but unbeknownst to me my hubby upgraded us since it was our anniversary. We were lucky enough to get a Jr. Suite. Little did we know that Hurricane Ike was on its way to our home in Houston. The hotel was very helpful in getting us up to date info so we could monitor the situation. I kept telling everyone that they told us to evacuate so we did, TO MAUI!!!!! Upon arrival we were greated with flower and shell leis, car was valet parked ( complimentary the first evening). We were personally excorted to our luxurious suite! The resort was spotless! We saw some tiny ants, called and they were gone within the hour! Comp coffee was delicious! We had a huge bathroom , double sinks, separate tub and shower, Double Lanai w/ table chairs, lounge and small table with doors to bedroom and living room, oceanfront view, microwave, extra murphy bed in wall, huge closets, safe, robes, iron & board and wonderful toiletries. Each night there was entertainment including the cliff diving ceremony! Many came to watch it every night. We snorkeled Black Rock and it was great! We also did a Trilogy snorkel trip but not to Molokini. We did the 2 snorkel trip and it was some of the best snorkeling we've done. Everyone at the Sheraton was so kind, welcoming and friendly. Everyone is so happy it's contagious! We could have earned extra starpoints if we went to the starwood properties presentation but we chose not to. Since we had a refrigerator we bought muffins and pastries and papaya juice to eat on the lanai every morning before be ventured out sightseeing. We loved the coffee and tea selections in our room and did not need a big breakfast! We ate most meals on Front St. in Lahaina, De longhis, Bubba Gumps, Lahaina fish co and others! There is every type of food you desire at all prices. The location is great! The Sheraton was renovating the laundry area to be the new Spa. We originally booked a deluxe OF room on Black Rock and because we upgraded, our suite was closer to Whalers VIllage. I must admit that the when we walked to Bldg 6 (our original room) I understood why some felt it was far away! It is!! The rooms would be lovely during whale season! Apparently there is an abundance of whales off the Lanai's of Bldg 6 and that would be worth the walk . Our car was self-parked in the parking garage very near our room. When we opened our door in the AM we saw sunrise and at night on our Lanai we saw sunset. It was Perfect!!! We drove to every other part of Maui and viewed the hotels in all price ranges. We really like the Kaanapali area because you are close to everything! The Wailea area was off the beaten path and it seemed it would take a while to get anywhere! You would have to have a car! Gas is now $4.69 /gal so being near everything was a definite plus. We rented a car and did all the drives including Hana to the end!!! It took us 7 hrs total but we stopped and saw many sights!!! We drove to Haleakala for sunset and then stopped at Mama's Fish house for Lunch!! We also drove the winding road from Wailuku to Kapalua and that was an unexpected treat. We stopped at the Art Gallery and then at Julias for Banana Bread and Lorraines for Shave Ice and good conversation. It was worth the trip!!! We visited many out of the way beaches and snorkeled everywhere we could! There isn't enough room to tell everything we did! I would stay at the Sheraton Maui in a heartbeat! The property is lovely, the entertainment is wonderful! They have a luau that is heavily attended on the lawn and we had a great view from our Lanai. It seems everyone wants to attend the Old Lahaina Luau but the Sheraton's right on the beach looked wonderful!! We hope to return again to Maui and will definitely stay at the Sheraton! Note: they now issue different colored wristbands to prevent non guests from taking up all the poolside chairs. They do a great job of policing their property and we appreciated the fact that we always found a lounge chair poolside! We had a wonderful Annversary and our home survived Hurricane Ike with only a few minor repairs needed!

We stayed at the Sheraton Maui hotel September 9, 2008 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c September 14, 2008. AIRPORT- no issues. We flew Hawaiian Airlines from Kona, Big Island to Kahului, Maui international. 20 min flight no issues, comfortable plane, on time. HOTEL \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Located in Kaanapali 40 minutes west of Kahului airport (easy drive) and 10 minutes from Lahaina. It is in a hotel zone Kaanapali Parkway which has 7 hotels all within walking distance of each other. Hyatt, Marriott Ocean club, Westin etc. Also, in this area is Kaanapali Golf Course and the Whalers Village shopping center. This is all connected by a cement boardwalk that follows the beach all the way from one end Hyatt to the Sheraton Maui. If you have ever been to Aruba it is like there hotel zone. Grounds were very picturesque and immaculate. Pool area is free form and winds throughout the property approximately 100yds long. Starts at deep end (8ft) which is adjacent to the Sundowner bar and winds its way to shallow end (with kiddie pool level) and the Lagoon Bar. Even has a little slide to bring you from one level of pool to the other. Hidden along the way is a Jacuzzi. Beautiful pool area. Unfortunately due to layout of pool not enough chairs if hotel is at high capacity. Hotel was fairly busy and if you were not out to pool early you would probably not get your preferred spot. Some chairs had umbrellas. Waitress service at pool was excellent. Can even have lunch brought right to your chairs. Food was pretty good. ROOMS \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Paid $500/night which included breakfast buffet for 2 each morning ($46/day value). This was top room ocean view in building 4 directly in front of black rock. We were on 3rd floor. Nice room, roomy, king bed, flat screen HDTV, refrigerator, safe (free), bathrobes, and small bathroom with funny sliding door (like a patio door). Plenty of drawer space but not much closet space. Closet is in the bathroom. Good size balcony with 2 chairs and table with great view of ocean/beach. They have rooms as low as $250. When you check in, which you do right at the valet desk, they give you 3 extra key cards in addition to your room keys. One is for the self park area (can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get in out without it) and the other 2 are towel cards. You trade them in at the towel hut (by pool) for towels. Then when you bring towels back you get the cards back. They will not give you towel without card. You can ask for more cards at front desk, which we did as we got 2 more cards. Valet is free first night then they charge you daily after that. DINING \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We only ate the breakfast buffet at the Keka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122a Terrace (part of our package) 4 of 5 mornings we were there. Breakfast buffet was excellent. All the usual breakfast options with a Omelet station every day, pancakes, waffles, ham, hash, fajitas, fresh fruit and breads, juices etc. This restaurant is open air and has a number of table on patio. There are always birds flying around as the open air design does not prevent them from flying around. If this will annoy you do not eat here for breakfast. We had lunch at Lagoon bar a couple of days and food was good. Too many choices nearby and down in Lahaina town to eat at hotel (which was pricey). At Whalers village, 5 min walk from hotel along boardwalk, we ate at the Hula Grille 2 nights. Once at bar and once in dining area. They have different menus. Both times food was very good and service was good. Also had a late night snack at Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, next door to Hula grille, which was good. Both of these are beach front restaurants most of seats being open air. One night took in the Old Lahaina Lua which was fun. Entertaining and buffet food was pretty good, drinks were plentiful. . BEACH \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Very nice beach. This hotel has the biggest beach of all the hotels in this Kaanapali Parkway area. In fact the closer you get down toward the Marriott and Hyatt the smaller (narrower) the beach gets. Unfortunately hotel charges $40/day for 2 chairs and umbrella. They will only charge you a half day rate if it is 1pm or later. My advice is to go to Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in downtown Lahaina and for $35 you can rent 2 chairs (short chair style), umbrella and a collapsible cooler for the entire week. Unless you need to have the chaise lounge style chair this is better way to go. This is a public beach so there will always be people here who are not staying at Sheraton as it is well known for some of the best snorkeling in Maui due to Black Rock. Snorkeling is fabulous. They rent gear right at pool or you can rent that at Snorkel Bob\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as well (cheaper). Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even need to go on snorkeling cruise as you will see all kinds of fish right here. There is even a family of 4 turtles which feeds on the coral off Black Rock in about 3-4 feet of water right off the beach. They swim within 1 foot of you as you are watching them. Maui was the perfect combination of relaxation, beach and night life for us. Downtown Lahaina has about a 1 mile (Front Street) stretch of shops, restaurants and bars for your entertainment.

Resort is located on one of the best beaches on Maui, definitely best beach of Kaanapali resort. Room (oceanview, 4th floor, bldg 3) was clean and had excellent view. Housekeeping did a nice job at about the same time (9am) every day. Our room was not the absolute most quiet as we could hear (on occasion) people in the rooms upstairs/adjacent as well as building (HVAC?) noise at night but in general we slept fine. Waking up at dawn to the blue and pink streaks of light out over the water in the distance made up for small amounts of noise. (However, not sure what the fuss is about regarding the Sweet Sleeper Bed. It seemed like nothing more than an ordinary, many-times-slept-in bed.) Food at the hotel is dull and pricey but convenient. Ask for \"Old Style\" Mai Tai if you are looking for the original Mai Tai with a little kick rather than the fruitier modern version. Breakfast buffet was $19.95 for cold buffet, $24.95 for hot buffet. Alternatives for breakfast are the other hotels on Kaanapali (Westin, Marriot, Hyatt Regency) or going to the ABC store at Whalers Village for individual serving sizes of cereal, milk, delicious papaya, yogurt, etc. Nice mini fridge in room. The biggest draw for us (late 40's-early 50's couple traveling alone) is the beach. Beach cabanas (double wooden chaise lounge with fabric hood as shown on sheraton-maui.com) are $40.00 per day. Swimming is perfect in normally calm, crystal clear water. For a few days there was an increased swell and actually some 3 foot breakers but the usual calm gentle rolling water returned. It's an absolutely wonderful place to do nothing: get up in the morning and have breakfast of some sort, go to the beach early, have lunch poolside and then back to the beach, cocktails at the end of the day while watching the sunset with the cliff diving ceremony. We did not even get a car on this trip. A cab to Kapalua ($60 r/t with tip) or Lahaina($40 r/t with tip) is a fine way to go when we felt like going farther afield for dinner. We figured the cost was about the same as renting a car for the day and was much easier than driving. This is our 3+ stay at the Sheraton after having stayed at the Kapalua Bay Hotel (no longer there), Kapalua Villas, Marriott and Maui Prince (in Makena/Wailea area) and it was the best vacation we've ever had.

The buildings( 1-6?) at Sheraton are very separated so you might be doing a lot of walking. Watch out if you are going with a large party, make sure everyone is in the same building.

The room was equipped with double sinks, separate WC and standard tub/shower combo. The products are Bliss (same as used in other Sheraton properties with spas). A small fridge and micro were available. The bed was very comfortable (sweet sleeper standard in all Sheraton properties) and sheets were soft. The room was clean and an excellent value for Maui. On several mornings we watched dolphins and turtles from the lanai. Housekeeping was spot on every day. The grounds and pools were beautiful. Chairs were hard to come by most mornings at the main pool due to those \"reserving\" and not using the chairs. The pool attendants were quite good about moving belongings if the chairs were unattended for more than 30 minutes. Service at the pool was hit or miss and quite expensive. They do have iced lemon water available at the pool side bar. Shade is at a premium so get there early and plan to not leave for more than 30 minutes if you want to keep it all day. Cabanas can be reserved (book very early - prior to arrival) at $75/day and double loungers/umbrella on the beach for $45/day. The beach is very nice but crowded due to the black rock location which attracts many who want to snorkel and jump from the cliff. There was an activity shop near the beach to rent snorkel or other gear such as boogie boards. Room service is very expensive (eggs benedict, french toast, two juices and coffee was $95). Win or tropical drinks were $10/per and up. The location is a quick stroll to Whalers Village for spots to dine (at reasonable cost) and a few higher end stores and boutiques. Once of the best meals of the trip (we didn't venture further than where we could walk) was at Tropico at the Westin. Imaginative food with an excellent and well priced wine list. We enjoyed the quiet atmosphere of the lobby location with limited tables (more intimate and quiet). A short 10 minute drive will take you to the Cannery Mall with a Long's drugstore (gifts at a fraction of the cost of the hotel gift shop) and a Safeway. There is a Costco near the airport which we will use on our trip in December. We enjoyed our stay and would return for the right rate.

Let me start off by saying that the grounds, pool, and beach are very nice. The rooms are just average (in need of refurbishment), but I knew that already. The housekeeping, restaurant staff, and bellmen were all great. However, the management team that we dealt with were VERY poor. I am a Starwood member and use Starwood hotels 2-3 times per year on vacations. I have always been very pleased with the treatment at their hotels. Last year, I booked a gardenview room at the Maui Sheraton and received an upgrade to Building 6, which is deluxe oceanfront. This year, I booked a gardenview at a discounted rate and knew that we may get an upgrade, but also knew it wasn't guaranteed. This is what happened. We arrived at noon and were told to come back at 3, as our room wasn't ready. No problem. We gave our keys to the valet and were told to leave our luggage in the car, lock it, and it would remain in the lot by the valet desk. They also told us that we would be in building 6. Since we hadn't expected that, we were very excited! We returned to the front desk at 3, only to be told that our room STILL wasn't ready. Hard to believe, since we arrived at noon that they couldn't get ONE room ready for us by 3pm! We were then told that we would be in building 3 in a mountainview room (which is same as gardenview, but on 3rd floor). I asked why we had been told that we were in building 6, then changed, and was told by Brandon, the Asst. Man., that they had the right to do that. We then went to find our car, but no one knew where it was! Finally, we were told that it had been moved to the parking garage with ALL of our luggage left in the car! Very upsetting, as we had been told it would stay in sight of the valet desk. Went back to Brandon expressing how upset I was about the room being changed, room not being ready, and now car being moved with our things still in it! He said he sympathized, but could do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about any of it!! I asked if we could just get a room in building 3 that faced the pool, but he declined. Funny, I had just heard them tell a lady that just checked in that she had been upgraded from gardenview to oceanview, but he coudn't do anything for us, who had been there at NOON! I told him that I was going to call Starwood, as we had never received such poor service at a Starwood facility before. Went to our room, called, and was transferred to Sheraton Corporate Headquarters. Robert acknowledged our many stays and said he would contact the hotel. MIRACULOUSLY, within 30 minutes, Brandon phoned to say that he had just had an opening in Building 6 that we could be moved into. We were then moved. Keep in mind that I wasn't upset just because we didn't get Building 6---I didn't even ask for Building 6. I was upset that we were told we were in it, then changed, in addition to the room not being ready and the car missing. I thought that once we moved, things would settle down. WRONG! Next day, my friend called and asked if I had received the gift basket she had ordered from the Sheraton. No we hadn't. She called and spoke with the manager of that department, who was also not very well trained on dealing with customers. What if she hadn't called? She may have been charged and never known we didn't receive it! He told her that it had been sent to our first room in Building 3 BEFORE our arrival, but we had switched rooms so didn't get it. NOT TRUE, because we WERE in that room and there was NO gift basket. When she asked him for the name of his superior, he refused to tell her! He did tell her he would send an additional gift basket with the one she ordered. The additional basket ended up being 2 waters, 2 cans of pop, and 2 small bags of chips. Why bother? The first basket that she had ordered came first with NO card even attached! My friend then spoke to Allison, another manager, who did acknowledge the error and removed the charge from my friend's credit card. Day 3, I went to talk to Allison and thanked her for taking care of my friend's situation. We had a brief conversation about the events at check-in and she made SURE to remind me that I had booked a gardenview and should not have expected building 6, even if I had been told I had it. She also had an excuse for everything I had complained about. Her objective, clearly, was to make sure I understood that I was in the wrong and didn't acknowledge any wrongdoing on the part of the hotel. The main reason I went to see her was to see about staying another night, since our first day had been ruined by the lengthy and stressful checkin. She was gracious about giving us another night at the rate we already paid. I told her I would gladly change rooms, but she kept us in the same one. In retrospect, I wish we just would've left when scheduled, because her attitude toward me was one of scolding a little child, NOT of trying to make a guest's experience more positive. This is a minor detail, but I had also been assured when I booked that we would have an acknowledgment of our anniversary, but that never happened either. Needless to say, I won't be back to the Sheraton. I have read online and in the Honolulu Advertiser about how Maui has been making tourists feel unwelcome, lately. The management at the Sheraton did a GREAT job of making us feel that way!

The beach is huge, uncrowded and the water is relatively calm because of black rock. Excellent snorkeling is literally right outside your room. Whaler's village is a 5 minute walk on the beach and getting to Lahaina is 5 minutes in a car. Rooms- The rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious. All the normal room amenities are avaialable. I have no complaints whatsoever about the rooms, however I really didn't spend much time in the room. When on Maui the only time in your room should be sleeping and changing clothes. Beach- Best spot on arguably the best beach on the planet. Enough said. Pool- The pool is nice. It is not a gargantuan with waterslides and swim up bars but it is pleasant. It is great for kids and there is an adult only area as well. Food and drink service at the pool was great too. Dining- This is the only area that I feel the Sheraton needs a little work. The food is good but limited. Service is great!! For more food choices take a short walk to Whaler's Village. Staff- They treat you like Ali'i (royalty, chief). Every staff member at this hotel was remarkable. Check in took about 5 minutes and we were on our way. Our bags were brought up very shortly after we got in to our room. The pool/bar workers are very nice and quick to get you what you need. I do not recall ever having to wait long for a drink. Concierge, valet and every other staff member was helpful, insightful and very pleasant. Price- The Sheraton is the same price as any other decent hotel in all of Hawaii. I have stayed at the Hyatt on Kauai and Kaanapali and Grand Wailea. Ignore any review where people complain about money. Hawaii is expensive and people complaing about this should just go to their local lake or river and skip the islands altogether. I highly recommend the Sheraton for anyone.

Now, onto the more fun stuff. The location of this resort is absolutely the best. Ka'anapali beach is phenomenal; black rock offers excellent snorkeling; it is a short drive to Lahaina; and only a ten minute walk to Whaler's Village, where there are restaurants and many nice shops. The grounds are beautifully maintained, and very pretty. The pool is fine, very large, very clean, and I think kids would love it. I preferred the ocean. Our room, which was considered ocean view (different to ocean front) looked over the gardens and pool and then the ocean beyond that. The view was phenomenal. We could also hear the waves from our room. The room itself was very basic, especially considering the high cost of this resort. However, the bed was SOOOO comfy! Both hubby and I slept well. The bedding is high quality, but the sheets are crisp, which is great until you have a sunburn, and then they scratch! Housekeeping services were excellent; we always brought back loads of sand with us, and each day it was cleaned up perfectly. There were some tiny bugs (ants, I think) in our room, but they didn't worry me enough to do anything about them. We only ate at the poolside bar once, and not at any of the restaurants. The food was okay. Very expensive for what it was. There were long waits at the other restaurants when we checked them out, and even for Maui, the prices were high. Check in was a breeze, as was checkout. We used valet parking every day, and I think it was worth the extra $5. One thing to know about this resort is that if you are in building four or a higher number, you will be walking a LOT! I actually counted, and it was 400 steps from our room to the front of the hotel where we picked up the car. That's okay until you come home late, either sunburned or exhausted or trashed or any combination, and then those 400 steps feel like a mile!!! The lobby and common areas of the hotel are really lovely, open to the outdoors, with breezes blowing through (and rain too, on a couple of the days we were there). The total Hawaii experience!

The turtles generally swim all around Black Rock- even while locals and tourists alike dive off the cliff, but they certainly did not limit their swim to the reef. We saw them all around us, along with Butterfly fish, Pufferfish, and oodles of Unicorn fish. I got the hang of using a snorkel because I didnt want to lift my head and miss a thing.

There is also Whaler's village about a 5 min walk, we ate at both the Hula Gril for lunch and Leilanis for dinner , get a reservation for dinner b/c it gets very busy.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAverage stay\u201d", "Author": "travelmom28", "ReviewID": "UR17949089", "Content": "We stayed two nights, before moving to a private residence rental.

Having travelled from London via LA, we were exhausted when we first arrived. Our Bellboy noticed were booked into a room that was a twin, obviously less than ideal for two newlyweds. The hotel could not do anything for us that night and instead chose to move us the following day which we were happy to do. Both rooms we were given were modern, well decorated, extremely comfortable and clean. The following morning, we experienced our first proper Hawaii experience - breakfast! Breakfast was prepared buffet-style, with a large amount of cereals, fresh fruits, cooked breakfast US and Mexican style, and with waffles or pancakes available. Fresh omelettes or fried eggs were cooked to order. We ate outside in the morning sun overlooking the palm trees in the complex and the ocean in the distance. It was fantastic, and it was the same for every breakfast for the rest of our stay. The hotel was well located within a group of other hotels. It's possible to walk to many other hotels and restaurants in the area, some of which are very good and some are distinctly average. However, if you fancy staying at the Sheraton, you can order from a limited menu or choose the Buffet where a choice of very good (but not excellent) meals can be chosen for a reasonable price. If you wish to book one of the sun-loungers on the beach next to the hotel, then you need to do so *before* you arrive. Most tourists from the US know this and ring the hotel to book in advance. There are plenty of sun-loungers by the pool though, and we were able to book a gazebo for a day. There is a waitress service outside, so you can obtain food from the BBQ and beers from the bar without having to move. Marvellous! The pool at the Sheraton is worthy of a mention. There are large areas of the pool, a deeper area for a little swimming and a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s area. But the pool is mostly made from a series of small 'channels' that navigate their way around the front of the complex i.e. between pathways, foot-bridges, seating areas and bars. I thought this was really well done and enjoyable for adults and older children. What with this, the small waterfall and hot-tub, and you've got a great way of breaking up the continuous sunbathing/eating/drinking! Out stay wasn't without problems though. Firstly, our toilet broke and couldn't be used until repaired. It took 3 separate complaints, (the final one to the manager) to get it sorted which took over two days - very poor. Plus, our bathroom suffered from small cockroaches. I complained about this on numerous occasions, and despite pest-controls best efforts, the problem was never resolved. Our final problem was that my Wife's bikini-top was stolen from our ground-floor balcony. When reported, reception staff could not have been less helpful. One final note: I would recommend car hire if you plan to do any exploring. There are some trips that can be booked through the Concierge, but for ease of getting around even the more local parts of the island, a car is useful. Overall, we had a great time at the Sheraton. I would have given this hotel the full 5* rating if not for the few problems that we experienced. As it is, the hotel fell a little short of our expectations. True, the hotel is only a 4*, but it's a pricey one and I feel that the hotel should try a little harder to sort out customer's genuine problems. But those problems aside, the great breakfast, superb complex and decent rooms make for a very enjoyable hotel experience.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Westwood, MA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "RedSox678", "ReviewID": "UR17714085", "Content": "We chose the Sheraton Maui because our friend had recommended this hotel over the Westin. We were using our SPG points to stay the whole time. As soon as we got there, we politely asked for an upgrade and they placed us into Building 6, room 6308. Our bellman helped us get to the parking lot and helped us bring all our luggage to our room. Not only that, he gave us some great advice on dining and adventures. I thought he was an excellent bellman. Our room was amazing!! It was a dream come true and if you are on your honeymoon, definetly suggest building 6. We got to see the cliff dive ceremony from our balcony and we got to see all the snorkelers in Black Rock. We had a large Kind size bedroom, with a large shower tub, separate toilet room, and a granite top sink. We had a LCD TV which was a great bonus. If you are travelling with small children, I would recommend the other buildings in the main area, not building 5 or 6. We had to take 2 elevators which we did not mind because we got to see our cute stray cats that said hello to us. By the way, if you are there, please take care of these sweet kitties with some water and food. Not only us, other guests were bringing them water as well. They are very friendly!! The beach was amazing right in front of the hotel. Other beaches were rocky, however, this was the best beach. Snorkeling at Black rock was the best place. We went on the Teralini throught the Sheraton, which stopped at 2 places to snorkel, however, there were more fish at Black rock. We saw turtles hanging out twice. My husband followed the turle for about 10 minutes and he didnt seem to mind. The teralani cataraman was ok, but owuldnt recommend it. The BBQ lunch was very stingy and not generous at all. The hamburger meat was thinner that a MacDonalds cheeseburger. The crew was friendly. They stopped to see Dolphins and turltes on the way. But for $119 per person, I would not recommend it. Black rock was the best place to snorkel. We ate at several places, however for breakfast, we recommend the Black rock grill for their breakfast buffet. It is priicey at 25 per person, however, they have a very big selection. Food is very pricey in general in Maui. We went to Roy's for dinner one night and even though it was expensive, we highly recommend it. The service and food was excellent. WE also enjoyed the Aloha Mixed Plate. Very cheap and good! However, we dont recommend Kimo's, China Boat, and Giovanni's. As far as the road to hana, we did not attempt. We were terrified with the drive up to Julia's banana bread (recommended by the Maui Revealed). The bread was great, but we did not expect anything like that. Do not attempt with kids!! It was a one way road, off a cliff, with no gaurd rails!! We stopped to see the Olivine pools and the blowhole. Great sights to see! Overall, we recommend this hotel to everyone. The Westin was boring and average, Everything was great, except all the restaurants in the hotel closed early. Also, the maids were extrememly rude. And lastly, the SPG sales people were kind of annoying. They called us 3 times in the room and twice on the cell phone! We just ignored them. Don't fall for the gift thing....its not work postcards for a 20 minute speech. Definetly stop at Costco's and get drinks before going to the hotel. Everything is very pricey!!

Few service negatives: We were missing slippers in our room. Then none of our lamps worked. Then I noticed that there was black mildew all over the shower head. All were fixed with calls to housekeeping but it was annoying that I had to call 3 times for unrelated things. Food: Restaurant is very expensive and the food is very average. We had prime rib and lobster and although prime rib was good, lobster was a bit overcooked. I sent back french onion soup that was so salty that it was inedible. We were just too tired to leave the property so we chose to eat there. Snorkeling: It is amazing! Snorkeling just by the rocks, I saw 2 turtles the first day and 3 turtles the 2nd day!

Not a huge choice of great restautants in the resort but we thought the food in the hotel was pretty good if you didn't want to venture far.

Needless to say, we got through some cash during our week here, I wouldn't like to think we were on holiday when the pound was weak against the dollar. Nice to walk along to Whaler's Village which has a couple of restaurants and some shops.

The hotel grounds are beautiful (if not a little confusing to navigate; this is a big complex, be sure to read and follow the directional signs for the long trek from your car to your room. And remember, the lobby is on the third floor.) The staff were pleasant and very helpful. The concierge was great and booked a fantastic dinner at the Old Lahaina Fish Co. for us. (Book at sunset.) Our room was clean and well decorated. The beds were very comfortable. The beach here is the best. This is the place to stay if you want to spend your days lounging at the beach or pool, boogie boarding, snorkeling or scuba diving. Be sure to reserve the beach cabanas in advance, if that's what you want. The snorkeling is good, but I found the depth a little too deep. There are shallower beaches elsewhere with a wider area to explore. That's why I think this area is best for beginning scuba divers.(You can rent snorkel gear at the hotel for $20 a day, or you can go to Snorkel Bob's in Lahaina on Dickenson St. and rent for a week for about the same price.) Still, I did see a green sea turtlle, and the snorkeling was fun. The bigger kids enjoy jumping off the Black Rock cliffs. We had to go back to our room, as we forgot something, and the housekeeper was there. She asked for our room key and made sure that it opened the door before allowing us to go in. That made us feel very secure and that the hotel had our best interests in mind. We only ate one time at the hotel and that was at the Kekaa Terrace for breakfast since our child could eat free. The breakfast for two of us was $54. I thought that was a little pricey. For comparison, breakfast for three at the Sunrise Cafe in Lahaina was under $30. For dinner, I suggest a nice stroll down the beach to the Hula Grill. Make reservations.

When we arrived we parked in the main entrance parking. We went to book in and were told we had parked our car the wrong way round as cars had to be parked front of the car facing the front(dont ask why!!!!!) and could we turn it round! (by the way you really do need a car to travel round as the hotel itself is 1 hour drive from the airport and what shops they do have in Maui are quite a drive and public transport is almost non-existant). We were booked into an ocean front room in the infamous building 6 where we were driven to by buggy! The building itself is somewhat detatched from the rest of the hotel and is in a quiet location which we liked. If you prefer this it is ideal for you. You do have to take 3 lifts and have a walk to the pool, restaurants and beach etc but after a while you get used to it. The room itself was spacious and clean. We had a small balcony with a view out on to the ocean. At night there was nothing to see- just blackness- maybe they could have used some lighting. I have to mention the bed. It was king size and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in- I slept like a log whilst I was there!! The lagoon pool was great. However if you want a sun lounger get there early as seating was limited and most people seem to dump a flip flop and a towel on a lounger and go off scuba diving, shopping or go to breakfast and leave it. The business centre was opened at limited times and internet access was pricey ($8 for 10 minutes) although there was free wi-fi access for lap tops. If you wanted to go to the beach you could hire cabannas, chairs and umbrellas from the pool center but this was also pricey - 2 chairs and an umbrella was $40 and you were limited to where you could sit. In building 6 we had a 'light breakfast' which we could attend for $12 each. The word light was right - avoid if you are slightly hungry as this consisted of bread, pastries, cereal and a few bits of fruit. The main breakfast buffet itself was fine. On the 2 days we did use it we generally had to wait for around 20 minutes to get a seat but there were no complaints on the quality of food although there could have been slightly more choice for such a big hotel. We tried the evening buffet once and it was fairly adequate. The lunch pool menu was great though although I thought the cocktails and beers were expensive. The main desk staff were unhelpful and slightly condescending in my opinion but the pool staff were great. Our room was given a clean once a day and also was tidied up and given clean towels in the evening. There is a free shuttle bus every hour from morning till around 10pm that drops you off at 3 stops in town. This is handy as apart from the hotels and Whalers Village (a 10 minute walk from the hotel) there isn't an awful lot of places to eat nearby.

Room and View: Had ocean view room in bldg 3 (not deluxe ocean view or ocean front), close to everything plus loved the view the best because you see beautiful grass and palm trees, pool, beach, ocean. Room had flat screen TV (although I understand other buildings might not have these yet), amazingly comfortable bed, bathroom okay and balcony small, but oh what a view! 2. Grounds: Seems to be the largest property on Kaanapali, and the grounds are beautiful and well maintained. 3. Pool: Nice size, perfect temperature, winding rivers throughout, several bridges, secluded Jacuzzi. Tiny waterslide for small tots; if you want more water slides then go to Hyatt or Westin (but then you have a tiny beach area). Never had a problem getting lounge chairs. 4. Beach: Largest beach on Kaanapali, protected by Black Rock (not as big waves, great for kids. 5. Black Rock: Beautiful backdrop to beach, plus great snorkeling right there. Swam with a turtle! 6. Fun family activities: Had BBQ and movie night, other kid-oriented activities covered by resort fee. 7. Buffet Breakfast: Had this included in package, and to my surprise they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge me for child even though we had adult free coupons. Buffet large, great variety, main entrees changed daily. Ate there every day and never got bored. Also loved talking with Kaleko, who is their \u00e2\u20ac\u201c get this \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ambassador of Aloha. 8. Service: Drinks by pool, breakfast, housekeeping, all staff had excellent customer service. 9. Whalers Village: About a 7-minute walk, couple of good restaurants, nice shops, Whaler Museum. Nice to have this in walking distance. 10. Not a high-rise: Only hotel on Kaanapali besides Kaanapali Beach Resort (lower end) that isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a high-rise. Buildings have only a few floors (we were on floor 3 and never took an elevator!). If, like me, you prefer not to be in a high-rise, then this hotel is the one to stay at! Only negatives: Parking: Kind of far from buildings 3 and 4 (buildings 5 and 6 have separate parking), but nice walk with beautiful views of grounds. By the way, about free valet parking on day 1\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you have to move your car on day 2 otherwise you get charged. Fitness Center: Okay, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in building 5, kind of far unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in building 5 or 6. They are building a new spa on 1st floor of building 4, not sure when it will be ready to open. Room: Only can choose 2 double beds or one King, and with a very tall husband, we went for King bed with rollaway for child. Also, as previously mentioned, balconies are small, bathrooms nothing special. High cost of equipment: We went to Boss Frogs on way back from airport on first day; got snorkeling gear, beach chairs, and boogie board for whole week at same price hotel charges for one day. Also about Boss Frogs, if you rent snorkel equipment for a week then you get free afternoon snorkel cruise (with $7 charge for fuel).", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tucson, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel - Wonderful Beach\u201d", "Author": "AZtravelpeople", "ReviewID": "UR16930853", "Content": "Stayed at the Sheraton Maui in June of 2008 for 5 nights for our honeymoon. We had an \"ocean front\" room and we loved it. The Sheraton definitely has the best beach location on Kaanapali. Venturing further south, you'll realize that the other resorts have barely any beach at all. We walked (and jogged) several times as far south as the Hyatt and I was always struck on how little beach-area the other resorts had. The pool was not huge, but not small. There are a couple of little bars poolside and it makes for an absolutely beautiful place to have a couple of drinks and watch sunset. We only ate a couple of meals at the resort -- lunch pool side at the Sundowner Bar, and a late lunch at the Keka'a Terrace (we were given a coupon at check-in). As you would expect from a oceanside resort, the food and drinks were expensive. The only disappointing aspect of our stay was our lunch at the Keka'a Terrace. The service was terrible. It appeared that we showed up just before a shift-change, so our initial waitress took our orders, delivered our drinks, and then disappeared. After the food was delivered, I thought the place had closed -- literally no service for over 10 minutes. I had to fetch my own ketchup from an adjacent table and I really wanted another drink, but no such luck. When you're paying $20 a plate, you expect better than that. Whaler's Village is a great place to shop and eat -- and it's only about a 5 min walk along the beach. We absolutely loved our meal at Leilani's On The Beach and the ABC Store was great for getting supplies for our hotel room (bottled water, sundries, etc).", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for the right price\u201d", "Author": "RKMLosAngeles_CA", "ReviewID": "UR16928428", "Content": "We stayed here 7 nights in May, and we had a great time.

The resort itself is nice, although it could use a little rehab. Hallways needed new paint, and the rooms are okay, nothing spectacular. But we got a fantastic deal on our room - $179/night with the AAA rate on a garden view, and when we got there, they had upgraded us to a partial ocean view. Don't know if I'd pay extra for the partial ocean view, since the balcony is so narrow and not very functional, but it was nice to have the upgrade. Do yourself a favor and enroll in the Starwood program before you go - they give you all sorts of free stuff, and I think that's why we got the upgrade. Hawaii is very expensive, and within the resort, you'll feel like you're getting ripped off at every turn - $4 for a small coffee? $50 for two people for a breakfast buffet? (yes it was a very nice buffet, but better to go into Lahaina and eat at the Sunrise Cafe or Pioneer Inn).

The pool is smallish but looks bigger due to the layout. That's okay because it never seemed too crowded due to the adjoining Kaanapali Beach at Black Rock and the fact that the over-chlorinated and cloudy water in the pool made many people choose the beach over the pool altogether. Maui has for years been rated as the top island destination in the world, and it's beginning to show. The infrastructure is struggling to keep up with crowded roads, overly busy restaurants, and too much clutter. For instance, the Sheraton looks across the channel at the island of Lanai, just 8 miles away. Five years ago, when we stayed at the Marriott timeshare just down the way from the Sheraton, the view was magnificent. Now, it is cluttered with buoys, water platforms and markers for the competing parasail, boating and surfing businesses that fill the sky and the channel all day long. It's a rare time during the daylight hours when there are not at least 3-4 parasails in the air all at the same time, and the boats really clog the view. If the environmentalists could block offshore oil platforms, you'd think they'd do something about this, particularly since so many whales pass by during the migratory periods. The Sheraton suffers from the hype, with noisy machines going many nights to support the luau on the property, as well as the other activities. As a result, instead of hearing the waves at night, we heard the machines humming with sounds not unlike an RV generator, sometimes for most of the night. What is more, the amenities have a decidedly bolted on feel rather than being integrated into the property. For instance, the thin LCD TV is not hung on the wall; it sits on a table taking up space, and all of the movies we tried to watch were very digitized and jumpy, so much so that the management readily credited our account and acknowledged that others around the hotel had raised the same complaints. In short, the place is not what it once was, the gem of Kaanapali Beach; instead, it has fallen victim to its own success. Even the grounds have a minimalist feel, not quite up to par with the Marriott or the Hyatt down the way. The staff seemed not quite to get it either. We were there on vacation, not to work with the schedules of the maids or the exterminators. When we spoke to the manager about the inconvenience of having to leave our room for a few hours to allow an exterminator in (it was on a day when we were trying to avoid getting too much sun), he offered us a free movie. Of course, we couldn't watch it until we could re-enter our room, but that seemed lost on him. Other times, we called to speak to someone, and we got no answer or were quickly transferred and placed on hold for an extended time. I felt like I was back at the office, not on vacation in Maui. Finally, a bit about the bugs. I killed a decent sized cockroach in the bathroom one evening. The next morning, a smaller one met his maker on the bedstand. I took the dead varmints wrapped in tissues to the front desk to prove I wasn't lying. I was promised my room would be sprayed so as to be bug free for the remainder of my stay. It was sprayed alright, but that did not keep two more of the critters from scampering across the floor that night. Not quite what one expects at Sheraton prices.

Yes, it's pricier but we knew that going into this vacation and were perfectly ok with spending a little more for the convenience. The breakfast buffets ran $24.95 a person, but considering that it was essentially brunch for us, it was well worth the price.

We were treated with the utmost courtesy and even a little empathy. To our surprise , we were upgraded to an \"oceanfront\" room which was absolutely perfect. The room was huge, the view was spectacular, the decor was recently updated, the location close to everything, yet quiet. We really couldn't ask for better. Upon check-in the \"resort fee\" was mentioned again, so there really was no reason to be surprised at all. Let's face it, it is just a marketing gimmick to show an artificially low price (like freight/dealer prep., on a car), so simply add it to the room rate to get your total. This fad will soon fade away like all bad ideas. The beach, pool, and service were all outstanding. The charge of $40 per day for the cabana's was just silly (another bad idea). The buffets were very good while the pool side snacks were poor and pricey. The location of the hotel is fantastic, with shopping and recreation close by. The snorkeling was great.

We loved it! Upon check-in we were offered complimentary valet parking our first night. Check-in was fast but we got to our room and noticed we were given a handicap room. It wasn't a huge problem but the shower chair was kind of odd. We originally booked a garden view king. We went to to the front desk and asked if we could possibly transfer to another room and they kindly upgraded us to a top floor partial ocean view, no charge. They also found out it was our honeymoon, and when we returned from dinner champagne and glasses were waiting on us. Anita and Monica were excellent at the concierge desk. Sam at the Starwood desk also helped us because we assumed she was concierge and didn't figure it out until we had everything we needed. They were all great and so nice! We ate at the Lagoon Bar (multiple times) and at Black Rock Steak and Seafood. Everything was excellent! We both highly recommend the Lava Flow beverage! The one problem we did have was that we never figured out the shuttle service to Lahaina and the Whaler's Village. We only tried it once though. Westin shuttles kept arriving to pick up and one driver told us he couldn't take us and finally another Westin guy told us to hop on after we waited 45 mins. We found the 5 min back walk to the Whaler's Village better anyway. It is paved the whole way. Lahaina you cannot walk to. At the Whaler's Village, we recommend Hula Grill and Leilani's (sister properties). The same owner also has Kimo's in Lahaina which was great too. We had a rental car for the week and found it well worth the cost ($160 compact with Hertz) even though it sat undriven for a few days. Parking was never overcrowded and we always found pool chairs but never bothered with beach chairs. Snorkeling was the best! We went two days for an hour ($8 a person) and saw sea turtles both times. The turtles tend to eat between 2 and 3 p.m. You don't have to go our far either. We never even passed the end of the Black Rock. Do your souvenier shopping at the Lahiana Cannery Mall. As far as other great places: 1. Cruiser Phil's biking down Haleakala. We loved our guys and they were safe with us. It was pricey though. Our disappointment was that we never got to actually see the crater. We were one of the first groups to arrive and it was so overcast and rainy that nothing ever appeared. It was very cold up there as well! 2. Air Maui helicopter ride over West Maui and Molokai. We went with the less expensive tour for 45 mins and thought it was great. We bought and DVD of our ride ($40) which we should receive any day. We also were able to request the front seat due to our weight (both of us about 130 lbs). 3. Road to Hana. The road was long and tiring, but beautiful. I think our problem was that we just didn't get up early enough because we arrived at the Seven Pools and the rain started coming down. We were pretty bummed after our day drive. Soaked and dirty, we drove down to Charles Lindbergh's grave which was very nice. It was quiet and very pretty. Sheraton exceeded our expectations and after being back at home for one day we are trying to figure out how to move. Thanks to all!

We had been somewhat concerned in December and January about the reviews we had read on Trip Advisor when we were deciding on a hotel with our travel agent at AAA. After much research we decided to have our travel agent book the room for us using our AAA discount rather than booking online. We had her request building 6 because we had read good things about the view as well as the peace and quiet. She was told that they couldn't guarantee, but they would do what they could. We got to the hotel from the airport just after 3:00 in the afternoon. We were met by the bell staff and checked in very quickly at the front of the building. We didn't even need to go in. After a beautiful flower lei greeting for both of us, we were shown to our room in building 6. It was a ways away from the main lobby and front of the building, but that was the point. We had booked a deluxe ocean front room and the view didn't disappoint. It was absolutely beautiful. There was a full view of Lanai'i and Molokai'i. We saw whales a couple of days, and people jumping off Black Rock when they dared. The room was plenty big with a king size bed. It was clean and cleaned well every day. The furnishings were fine but starting to show the signs of age and wear. It could have used new carpet or at least a carpet cleaning and maybe some new dressers. The pads on the lanai chairs were worn as well. But this was the only issue we had with the room. The only issue we had with the hotel itself was one day it was very windy and blew all the \"Do Not Disturb\" signs on the ground. (There are open air hallways throughout) When we came back from snorkeling for the day, a sign was on our door saying they had attempted to clean our room but the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign was on the door. We had not put it there. Ours was still inside the room. We called housekeeping and they arranged to come clean at 3:30 after we had left again for the evening. They apologized for the inconvenience, and the room was cleaned when we returned. The bulk of our stay was fantastic. We didn't have to fight to find pool chairs. We were always able to find two together when we wanted them. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The concierge was extremely helpful and patient in helping us book a dinner cruise for our anniversary. The Black Rock Steakhouse and the Lagoon Bar had very good food that was not priced any differently than comparable bars and restaurants here. The banana margarita at the Lagoon Bar was yummy! Don't order a lemonade from the Sundowner Bar. It's bar gun sweet/sour. Yuck! We didn't mind the 5 minute walk from our room to the pool/beach area. It helped burn all those extra calories that you eat on vacation. Besides, we were away from the action and that kept the room itself a little quieter. (There was no problem with noise in any way, shape, or form.) We had a rental car but maybe wouldn't have needed one. There was transportation available to bring guests to Whaler's Village and Lahaina. Whaler's Village was close enough to walk to, but Lahaina was not. The regular trips were convenient, but sometimes very full - standing room only on the shuttle. We also walked to the Westin one evening for their Luau. Highly recommend that.. The food and drinks were fabulous and the entertainment was very good. Besides, there was no buffet line! Everything was served family style at the table. Overall, my husband and I thought the extra money spent to get the view and the quiet away from the main part of the resort was well worth it. The 20.00 per day resort fee seemed a little much. We didn't use any of the services it paid for, but we knew about it ahead of time and made the decision to stay there despite that. So no complaints from us. The staff was great, and even the check out process was simple. We reviewed our charges which were correct, they printed a statement, took our keys, and we were on our way!

The Sheraton Maui is a great mid priced hotel in a great location. The walk to Whaler's village is nice, where you can find three resturants and a mall like fast food court, along with several tourist and high end retail shops. Lahaina town is a short 5 minute drive. Front street has lots of great resturants and shops. I would highly recommend the Lahaina Store and Oyster Bar. It is a raw bar that suprisingly has the best prime rib I have ever tasted. Nice atmosphere, not too bad on price. Now for the Sheraton. Our room was in building 4. It was larger than your basic hotel room, and had a large bathroom and balcony. Housekeeping was great everyday. The view is amazing. Snorkeling at the resort is great. Snorkel equipment is available at the resort, but is much cheaper if you rent in town. I cannot report on the food at the resort, as we mostly were out exploring Maui during the day and had dinner in Lahaina or Whaler's Village every night. I did get a pineapple smoothie the last day we were there and although it tasted great, it was in what I would call a small cup and was costly at 9.50. The best thing about this resort is the beautiful beach, great rooms and location. Basically, if you are in wanting to go to Hawaii because you just want to go to Hawaii, stay at the Sheraton Maui and you will not be dissapointed. It is really great. I really believe that Maui probably has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth.

In addition to excellent hotel dining, there are plenty of great restaurants in Lahaina; Longhi's, Kobi's and Kimo's to mention a few. If you like fresh seafood Maui is the place for you. We found that the helicopter ride up to the volcano was exhilarating. You've got to try it. We had rented a convertible car but rarely used it with the top down. Pretty much all attractions can be viewed within a 60 minute drive except for the infamous Road to Hana. We passed on it but did view the remote area on our helicopter excursion.

The free snacks and fresh pineapple slices in the afternoon poolside were a nice touch. The property was very quiet @ night but we loved this. It was perfect to walk for drinks or dinner elsewhere and return to the relaxed Sheraton atmosphere. The only reason we never ate dinner @ the Sheraton was we liked to walk off property at night. The Sunset torch ceremony was a great way to start every evening while having a cocktail and a appetizer...Very relaxing... We enjoyed the pool complex and didn't feel crowded even though the hotel was booked to capacity (we asked the staff). The pool staff monitored lounge chairs and removed towels if left unattended for more than about 30 mins. We liked the fact we did NOT need to reserve chairs at the crack of dawn like other hotels we've visited. Many other near by hotels had larger pool areas but had a \"spring break\" type of feel to them (too crowded & very noisy.) Our one and only complaint was the actual room. Like the next review we felt the room was very tiny --- and we were in building 4 having a deluxe ocean view... Also the room wasn't clean upon arrival. We called housekeeping immediately and they arrived within 10 minutes. They recleaned the bathroom and put new sheets on the bed- The first comforter was all stained, the bathroom had hairs, & EVERYTHING was covered by a layer of dust when we first walked in..

The beach area is large and we were pleasantly surprised that we were charged 1/2 price when we rented 2 beach chairs & an umbrella after 1pm.

One more small thing -- The concierge was very busy so get there early or be prepared to wait in line. If you choose to valet it was only $5 per day. We came from Oahu where it was $20 per day. There was a fridge in the room which came in very handy for keeping water/ juices/ beer etc. No coolers are allowed @ the pool area but if you're headed to the beach or Hana it was very helpful.

The staff was very friendly as well, as was everyone we met on the islands. However, here are the downsides - there is no nightlife on the property itself. We were on our honeymoon so were not looking for much, but their 'lounge' was basically the breakfast terrace converted into a restaurant with a bar at night, so it totally lacked any ambiance. Some of the little touches were missing that would be at other hotels of the same price range, but not many complaints there. The room was one of the smallest hotel rooms I have stayed in (not in a major city) - and we had three weeks worth of luggage so it was particularly tough. Overall, we much preferred this to the Westin where we originally checked in (and immediately checked out of since it was basically three high rises built around a very crowded pool area). If I go back to Lahaina, I would choose this again, or maybe the Hyatt Regency but there is very little beach here. However, for a honeymoon I would check out Wailea since there seem to be more resort-like properties there.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "AZ", "Title": "\u201cExcellant Resort\u201d", "Author": "TravelTrogs", "ReviewID": "UR14968586", "Content": "Fast check-in at curbside.

We arrived the day after Thanksgiving, and checked out one week later. We specifically booked this hotel because it is the last hotel on Ka'anapali Pkwy, and we specifically booked building 6 becuase of its remote location from the rest of the resort. We had a top floor room, with a perfect view of Molokai. Looking north, we had a great view of the resorts on the \"other\" side of Ka'anapali, and there was no view whatsoever of the rest of the resort (which was great for us). My boyfriend does not eat breakfast, and enjoy a light one. The mini-fridge was perfect for my yogurt. We went to Safeway in Lahaina and stocked up on yogurt, granola, and a case of water. We ate in the restaurant twice for breakfast (once it was raining and I wanted French Toast and the other day we were going on a 4 mile hike and needed to properly fuel). The prices were not great, but expexted. We ate one night at the Teppan Grill, and that was fun...about the same price we would pay for benihana's here in California. We ate one day at the poolside cafe, and teh quality was acceptable. I spent the $40 one day on a beach cabana, and for me, it was well worth it! We spent a lot of time relaxing in our room and on the lanai, so we feel we got our $$$'s worth. The housekeeping service was great. We didn't really interact with the front desk except when checking in & out. We didn't use the valet at all, but the bell desk was great the day we checked out and stored our luggage. All in all, the Sheraton gave us what we wanted: a perfect view, a clean, comfortable room, and to be left alone!

We were upgraded upon arrival and weren't disappointed in the room: decent size, comfortable beds, functional bathroom, great lanai with view, and a welcoming gift. The best things about the hotel were the openness (stayed in bldg 2 overlooking the huge lawn and ocean), beach (size and features including Black Rock for scuba/snorkeling/jumping/turtles, size, and cleanliness), attentive staff, proximity to other facilities (5 minute walk to Whalers Village, half hour jog along the beach, 8 minute drive to Lahaina, 8 minute drive to Kapalua resorts and beaches), the activities (hula lessons, pilates, yoga, chef lessons, etc) and the overall feeling of not being too crowded even though the hotel was full. What I liked the least were the expensive drinks and restaurants (paradise will co$t you), the well documented chair charge and hassle of beach umbrellas and chairs, and I guess the $20 convenience fee (valet parking was $5 - c'mon, let that one go). Best place to have a meal nearby is the Hula Grill; best breakfast is the banana-mac pancakes at the Gazebo restaurant in Kapalua, best expensive and overall meal is Mama's Fish House, best sushi is Sansei's in Kapalua. We took the Keralani excursion because Trilogy was full - it was great. We did a beach scuba at Black Rock with Maja and it was pleasant (turtles, octopus, schools of fish, needle fish, heard the whales).

The other half of our trip was on Lanai (you can guess where), and this half at the Sheraton was definitely the most fun part of the two weeks. The welcome you get at the front of of the hotel is very warm. Greeters are on-hand to give you the obligatory lei and a smiling \"Welcome to the Sheraton Maui\", the valet is right there, ready to take your car, and the bell boys whisk your luggage away faster than you can say \"Where's the front desk?\". The conceirge service is second to none. They have 4 conceirges working all the time, doing anything they can to help you book activities. We booked a helicopter tour, a snorkeling tour of Molokini, and a Luau at a competitor's hotel when the Sheraton's Luau was full (don't ever do a luau, by the way, as it's a huge waste of money, and incredibly cheesy. Spend your $150 a person on something constructive like.......well, anything else). Basically, everything up at the front part of the hotel worked perfectly. The rooms are pretty standard fare, nothing super special. The safe was nice, as my girlfriend had some jewelry she wanted kept out of the open. We had a mountain view (i.e. not ocean view) room, but we could still see the ocean out our window, and we were not at all subjected to seeing ugly condo highrising when we went out on our balcony. Staff service was superb. It wasn't the incessant \"What can we do for you, Sir?\" that you get every 5 seconds at some hotels, but was a nice, medium amount of helpfulness that gave you some privacy, while still enabling you to get help when you needed it. Room service was very quick, and the food was great. The breakfast buffet was incredible (I still dream about it). The pool was one of those circuitous river-like pools, which was fun. The poolside bars were also supremely satisfying. I fondly remember eating a seared Ahi sandwich, drinking a malt beverage, and watching a bowl game all within view of a beautiful horizon. Oh yeah, that's one more thing: you can see the island of Lana'i perfectly almost all the time. It's like looking at a postcard every single day. I'm usually am hyper-critical of hotels when I feel like there's something incredibly annoying and/or easily fixable about them, but with the Sheraton Maui, I really can't find anything that gets my goat. Probably the most negative thing I could say is that it seems to be incredibly popular, so you'll probably have to be on your toes to get a pool chair, or a beach cabana.....but even that's not very hard. Oh yeah, if you want to park your own car, you can do that too (I hate hotels that are valet-only). We would park behind the Sheraton, near the tennis courts, and leisurely walk into the hotel. Very nice. You don't want to have to deal with tipping valets, and talking to front staff people, and encountering the throngs of new, disoriented tourists every single time you reenter the hotel, so this relaxed parking option was perfect.

WOW! Here are some hints/suggestions travelers need to know when staying at Sheraton and Maui 1-be prepared to pay big bucks. good ocean view rooms are expensive, resort fee of $20/day is crazy, pool side food/drinks are over priced. This is all part of the experience. when your at the pool you cant really get up and go eat anywhere else. close by places are also pricey. you are in Maui, not Mexico or Cuba 2-rent a car! there is no transit system and cabs are VERY expensive. Parking is free and plenty @ the hotel. Directions are easy to follow. With the car rental, you can get a GPS system for ~$60. 3-chairs, cabanas, and umbrellas at the beach will go quickly and you have to pay for it. This is the only thing i didnt like about this hotel. Pool side chairs are a better alternative, free, and available. You do have to be an early riser to get them too 4-Go for the room deal with buffet breakfast included. This is so worth it and breakfast is great 5-If you arrive after 11pm, there is NO FOOD at the hotel or close by at all. You will have to drive to Safeway, ~10min drive from the hotel 6-GO TO FRONT STREET. it is so nice, full of shops, art galleries, and great restaurants. While there, for high end dinning worth the high end price, try Lahaina Grill. Make reservations. For casual dinning, way less expensive, try Cheeseburger in Paradise. Long line-ups, cannot reserve but great 7-Whalers Village: Great little shopping/dinning location. Food is good, prices high for what you are getting...but again, remember u r in Maui. 8-Try Roy's in Lahaina. Great food and yes slightly pricey. Try the Thai Shrimp entree. overall, this was a great vacation. Be prepared to spend your money, there is no way around it. The Hotel is wonderful. The pool and beach great. Grounds are nice.

The beach at Ka'anapaali is wonderful for all age groups. In our parties we had a pre-schooler and teenagers and all loved it. The Sheraton pool is pretty good, although it does not compare to some others we have seen in Hawaii such as the Hilton properties on Oahu and the Big Island. The property is very clearly a product of the 60s, although they have done a good job of keeping it fresh and updated. The restaurants are all pretty average, although in Hawaii even average is incredibly expensive. The breakfast buffet was uninspired and remained exactly the same throughout our entire stay. There are quite a few dining options in Whaler's Village, which is about a 10 minute walk. I am a Starwood Platinum, but I have found at resorts it does not have too much sway. Our \"deluxe\" view room had what in most places is called a partial ocean view room. There are no suite upgrades offered for platinums here during spring break. My 2nd room was on points and was a garden view, amazingly the garden view was right next door to the the deluxe ocean view. The check in is pretty easy with the bellman having your packet ready to go. The location is very good for what West Maui has to offer, great beaches, shopping and dining in Lahaina, and the attractions like the Nakalele blowhole. Hana and the Haleakala crater are 2 hours plus by car. The main negative of this place, and many other Starwood proprties in Hawaii is the ceasless flogging of timeshares. They do not let up ever. Every \"Aloha\" from a seemingly friendly staffer has some sort of timeshare hook attached to it. If I were to come back to West Maui I would probably try another property.

Most of all there was hardly any of that \"aloha\" feeling and everything was over-priced even for Maui. You pay for chairs at the beach. You pay a resort fee. You pay way too much even for Hawaii for restaurant food. And the room service menu? Don't get me started. And the personal touch we did have- at the beach services kiosk- was just trying to sell us more stuff. They rudely suggested my husband buy their $180 sun glasses to replace the ones he was wearing.

Plus, they have the added benefit of having exceptional snorkeling right on the property. Although our experience was very positive, there were a few setbacks. 1.) The expense of snorkeling equipment on-site. If you plan on snorkeling more than an hour, it's wise to rent your equipment in Lahaina on the way to the hotel. Equipment in town is $5/day and $15/week, versus $8/hour at the hotel. This isn't so much a drawback specific to the Sheraton as it is typical of all the resorts. 2.) The pools close earlier than other hotels on the strip, so no evening swims. The spa, however, stays open late. 3.) Because the beach is so nice, it can get crowded with guests from other hotels. Snorkeling in particular is a bit of a madhouse between 9 and 3. Best to go early morning or late afternoon. Valet is only $5/day and, frankly, worth the price. Beds are very comfortable.

The beach is AMAZING! It never felt crowded (in fact at times we were the only ones there) and the snorkelling/scuba at the black rock is fantastic. I saw 8 sea turtles, lots of reef fish, eels,etc. while on a scuba dive around the black rock. I snorkelled with a sea turtle about 30 feet from shore. The pools are very, very cold. It was rare to see anyone brave enough to take the plunge. However, the pool areas and grounds are very beautiful and well maintained. The hotel rooms are average. The gardenview/mountain view rooms were old, small and not very inviting. We ended up upgrading our room to a Oceanfront Suite (at a significant charge) to gain some extra floor space, microwave, etc. The Oceanfront suites (Bldg 6) have terrific views, we watched the whales/dolphins/turtles for hours. The hotel restaurants are OK. They are very expensive ($22 for breakfast, $14 for a chicken wrap, $10 per drink) and I found the tastes very bland. However, there are many good restaurants in Whaler's Village (five min walk) and in Lahaina (5 min drive). Giovani's, Hula Grill, Napili Shores Gazebo and BJ's were all favorites. We used the shuttle many times- it was especially useful when going to the Old Lahaina Luau so that we didn't have to worry about a Designated Driver. There was a mix of people at the hotel- many young familes, retired couples, and a few conventions going on. We found the hotel very accomodating for our family which included a 11 month old infant.

Our group had several young children (ages 0-8), who had plenty of fun playing on the beach and on the large lawn between the hotel and the pool area. They also enjoyed the hula lessons. Several in our group snorkeled right in front of the hotel by Black Rock and were very happy with the experience. It's a short 10-minute beach walk to great shopping and several good restaurants. One last comment...the wind was fierce for the duration of our stay. We had read before our trip that this section of the island could get a little windy in the afternoon, but it was windy all day, every day. And we live in Oklahoma so we know wind!

Other than the new flat panel TV, furnitures and facilities in the room show some aging, for example, shower head is usable but the spray pattern ring is broken, the toilet got clogged once (they fixed within 10-minute of call and gave $50 dinning credit to the account, nice). Sheraton's grounds are the best in my opinion among all Ka'anapali resorts, very open, large and well maintained lawns, great beach right by the Black Rock, no artificial gardens or fancy water falls, or imported animals in pseudo-zoo like settings to crowd the ground like Westin and Hyatt, creating an airy and laid back atmosphere best suited to the beauty of natural surroundings of West Maui. My daughter happily ran around the huge lawn chasing the real birds rather than the \"artificial\" flamingos (which she can get at any mainland zoo). We feel more like in Maui at Sheraton's setting than in other resorts. My daughter also loves the Keiki Pool. Sheraton has some OK restaurants, but the room services suck - tasteless and expensive even at Maui standard. However, the convenient location (5-10 minutes walk along the beautiful beach path leads to Whalers Village and adjacent resorts including Westin of the same chain) offers abundant dining choices (plus shopping/grocery). An easy stroll along the beach or the path at dawn or dust also set the perfect mood for breakfast or dinner. I can't stress enough that Sheraton has the best (most convenient ) location in West Maui. Sheraton's services are great - quick and attentive. Once my daughter in her new Croc slipped in the lobby, after we picked her up and before her crying stops, out of nowhere came a manager offering tissues and a stuffed whale (the resort souvenir easily sold for at least $20 at the gift shop), which not only calms her down but also cheers her up for the whole day.

We let them know in advance that it was our anniversary, and upon arrival, they informed us that we had been upgraded to an ocean view room (from a garden room). We were able to get the keys for our room at the greeting desk next to valet/bell service, which was nice as we didn't have to wait to check in. We just went from the greeting desk straight to our room. We were in building 4 on the 3rd floor, and our king room had a wonderful lanai and view of the ocean and down the beach. The room was a good size and in good shape - nothing was stained or torn. We appreciated having the small fridge, as we went to the grocery store to buy snacks and drinks. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was fine - the only complaint I have there is that the drains in both the sink and tub were slow and when we finished showering, there was typically enough water left in the tub to cover our feet. Maybe that's from the years of sand building up, but it should have been better. The room, bathroom, and lanai were all very clean. We rarely ate at the hotel because it was quite expensive. We did have mixed drinks by the pool - around $8-$10 ea - and we did eat one night at one of the pool lounges, which was reasonable. However, room service is outrageous - $25 for a hamburger. Even though the hotel was completely booked, we found the Sheraton to be so comfortable, relaxed and quiet. The grounds are just beautiful and so large, which we loved because we felt pretty secluded. We never heard noise from the adjacent rooms. We have stayed at the Westin previously (just a few hotels down from the Sheraton), and there was always this crazy energy, and a bit of chaos at the Westin. The Sheraton was completely different (even though there were many families and kids) - it was very laid back and serene. The beach in front of the Sheraton at Black Rock is the best and widest stretch on Kaanappali Beach. One thing - if you want lounge chairs on the beach, you have to rent them (along with an umbrella) from the hotel for around $30/day (I believe that's the price). If you would like to rent the small cabana-type thing (wood platform with cushions and awning), those are $60/day. We felt that was pretty outrageous - you already have to pay the resort fee of $20/room/night - couldn't they at least include beach chairs in that fee? They are free at the pool, so we felt they should be at the beach as well. One thing about the pool - there were a lot of people getting down to the pool early (8:00 AM) to get their towels, and then just putting them on chairs in prime sun locations to save the chairs. Many times, the people wouldn't come back down for hours, and in that case, the pool staff would pull the towels off the chairs and leave a note stating that the towels had been left for more than 30 minutes and no one (or any other items) was there, so the towels were returned. We saw this happen quite a bit, and it did cause some commotion as those people who \"claimed\" the chairs at 8 AM finally came back down at 11 AM and found other people occupying their chairs. We did see a few people get upset and complain to hotel management. I've never been to a hotel where they have been so proactive about removing towels - however, they never removed towels from chairs that had other personal items as well (books, etc). My husband and I thought this was an excellent policy. If the staff didn't adhere to this policy, the majority of chairs would be taken by 8:30 AM, and this is a vacation - we shouldn't have to play that towel game! All in all, we really loved the Sheraton. The purpose of our vacation was to relax, and we definitely did that! The location is excellent - at the far and of the beach and within the restaurants and shopping along the beach. Black Rock is the best stretch of beach and has the best snorketling.

Loud pounding mechanical noise constantly heard while in the bathroom. Must have been next to some kind of generator. Ensuing problems: Asked the concierge for a restaurant recommendation for fresh fish in the area. She said, \"Just walk around town and find someplace that you like\" and shrugged her shoulders. Outdoor beach showers not working for 4 days which resulted in having to track loads of sand back into our room to wash off, clogging the bathtub and creating a mini-beach on the bathroom floor. I called for housekeeping and was told they are at dinner and only work until 4pm. Parking garage in disrepair, elevators not working, limited spaces to park, difficult access.

I'm at work, F&^K!\" So glad my young daughter can pick up such a lovely vocabulary from the staff at the Sheraton Maui.

This is when the lunch restaurants was 5% full. Very slow and inattentive service. Asked for a rollaway bed... was told we would be charged $70 per day for one, said no to that We requested wine glasses... $5 per glass per day. Outrageous add on hidden charges galore (already on top of a $21 per day \"resort fee\"). Oh, and part of the resort fee was to take care of \"free shuttles\", which sadly never came the two unfortunate times we waited for it. The pool was full of sand (no working beach shower) and ice cold. The hot tub smelled like \"hot broccoli\", my daughter commented. I travel quite a bit for business, stay in lots of hotels (Starwood and others) and consider myself pretty reasonable when it comes to expectations. I always give the benefit of the doubt. Still, this place was pretty horrible and when one pays for a particular kind of experience (again, pretty basic standards were expected), this hotel and staff failed miserably. I would never stay here again and will stay at a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons property next time. You pay more upfront, but at least you get the service and experience you would expect from a higher end property and aren't incrementally charged constantly for it (and still a substandard experience).", "Date": "December 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surprise, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cExpensive & a disappointment!\u201d", "Author": "PinkSurvivor", "ReviewID": "UR11195679", "Content": "After a week on Kauai, we went to Maui for a week.

We booked through a travel agent (Aloha Travel--very positive experience) for a package which included transfers and tourney tickets. Granted we paid more this way, but we needed tickets for the tournament and transportation to the games. After MUCH research, we selected the Sheraton, primarily due to its separation from the other busy resorts and the prime beach. We considered the deluxe ocean front (buidling 6) but booked ocean view instead, going for the view of the beach and Black Rock as we thought it would be more fun to see a variety of views rather than just ocean. We asked for Building 4, and we were upgraded to an ocean front room. We were on the 5th floor with 2 lanais, which was fabulous. The rooms are small but clean and the bed and pillows very comfortable. The bathrooms and closet are small. The fridge was large enough for drinks and a few food items. Housekeeping service was good. The snorkeling at Black Rock is fabulous and we took advantage of it daily. The beach is so clean and spacious, especially compared to the beach in front of the other major hotels. We ate one lunch at the hotel with a buy one, get one free coupon, and two buffet breakfasts as we had vouchers included in our package. Otherwise, we ate off property. Our favorite restaurant was Kimo's. We did not rent a car but took the hotel's free shuttle into Lahaina and walked the boardwalk to restaurants and for exercise. The pool water was colder than the ocean, but hey, you're in Hawaii, and it's not that hot this time of year just sitting at the pool!! Plenty of chairs available too.

This was our 5th trip to Hawaii in the last 7 years. We have stayed at many hotels in Hawaii, including the Ritz Carlton in Maui, and this was one of our favorites. This hotel is fabulous! The grounds are immaculate, the pool is beautiful and the beach is probably the best we've seen. I only have one complaint that I'll get to at the end. First of all, we had a deluxe oceanfront room in Building 6. Anyone who complains about the walk is just a complainer. The walk is not that bad and the views on your way to the beach/pool are beautiful. You do have to take 2 elevators, but they are very fast and it's not that hard to figure out. We had it figured out after the first time. It's absolutely worth the walk to get to Building 6. All the rooms are literally oceanfront with nothing to get in the way of your view. There is the island of Lanai to one side and the island of Molokai to the other side and you can see the lights of Oahu in the far distance. The waves are crashing on the rocks right outside your window. The rooms were pretty good, could definitely be upgraded a little. For the price you pay you expect a walk-in shower, not a shower curtain. It needed a little paint and carpet refresher, but nothing you couldn't live with. We had trouble logging into the high-speed internet in our room, so we called someone to come fix it. We never once complained about it and still we got two food vouchers for $15 a piece for our \"trouble\" to be used at any restaurant on the grounds. The pool was beautiful, very clean and refreshing. Lots of chairs and plenty of room. The resort was pretty dead this time of year, as was the entire island. This is definitely a \"down\" time for them. It was a prefect time of year to go. The beach is amazing. It is all sand bottom with great snorkeling by Black Rock. No big waves this time of year. The beach infront of the Sheraton is the best on Kaanapali. We spent a day exploring the beaches over in Kihei and Wailea (Four Seasons Resort) and the beach at the Sheraton is so much better. We loved that it was a short walk to Whaler's Village area - we ate at Hula Grill twice. We would walk down on the beach and then walk back on the path that is right at the top of the beach. You can walk on the path all the way from the Sheraton to the restaurants in about 5 to 10 minutes. The entire staff was very friendly. The grounds, pool and beach are some of the best we've ever seen. The one BIG complaint I would have is the price of the food at the resort restaurants. We ate dinner our first night at the Lagoon Bar - my husband had an Ahi Sandwich, I had a burger and we each had a Lava Flow drink ($10 each) for a total bill of over $60. We just couldn't believe it. The drinks were not that great and were in small plastic cups. You get twice the amount and better quality at any other restaurant in town for about $7.50. A small plastic cup of soda is $3.75 (no refills). The quality of the food we had was mediocre at best. We only ate at the pool bar once to use our free meal vouchers, otherwise we wouldn't have bothered. Whoever is in charge of running the restaurant portion of this resort doesn't have very good business sense. They would get so much more business if they would lower their prices even a little bit. We're all about relaxing and enjoying drinks, but even we couldn't pay $10 for a small plastic cup of a watered-down drink. We went to Safeway right down the road and stocked up on soda, water, wine, beer and snacks. We would take a small collapsable cooler with water and soda down to the beach every day and fill it with ice and it stayed cold all day. The location of this hotel is perfect. It is a short 5 minute drive to Lahina where there are a ton of amazing restaurants on Front Street.

It is a beautiful resort in a very beautiful location. We were upgraded to a Deluxe Ocean View room due to our Starwood Preferred Guest status. The room was spacious and in excellent condition.

Prices are high in the Kaanapali area, but we found that the prices at the Sheraton were higher than most. We spent the next four nights at the Westin just down the beach, and found that we got a lot more for our money at that resort. The Westin has slightly more affordable food and beverage options, free bottled water replenished in your room every day, free self-parking and $10/day valet parking. The Westin also has a better pool area and a daily schedule of free activities for both children and adults. Ultimately, we thought that the Sheraton was a beautiful place.

Given the high prices (although fairly reasonable compared to Westin Maui, Grand Wailea, Fairmont and Four Seasons), location in Kaanapali (near the BlackRock), simply the fact that it was a Starwood property, and strong reviews on Tripadvisor (4 to 5 stars) we came into the stay with rather high expectations. Positives: 1) Gym - not crowded, new machines, several TVs, clean 2) Breakfast buffet - fairly priced, wide variety, great service 3) Location and beach - Hotel is nestled up against BlackRock and is the last hotel on Kaanapali Pkwy, so there is a feel of privacy. Walking distance to and proximity to other hotels, several restaurants near the wate, and semi-upscale mall (e.g. Westin and Whaler's Village) 4) Rooms were decent and we were satisfied with the furniture, quality of the bathrooms, etc. 5) Hospitality at check-in. They gave us a lai and checked us in pretty smoothly and quickly. 6) Concierge woman (Lori) was very helpful. Negatiaves: 1) Room location and overall layout of the hotel - If you do make it to the Sheraton, be prepared to navigate through a maze of corridors and depending on your building location, *several* elevators. Imagine this: We were in Bldg. 6, and to get from our room to the concierge, for example, we had to walk one flight of stairs up, walk down a 30-yard corridor, take an elevator up a few floors, walk another 50-75 yards to another elevator, take it down numerous floors, and then walk another 2-3 minutes. Then the same walk on the way back. We'd do this round-trip begrudgingly 4-5 times a day. If not for this, I'd probably rate the Sheraton at 3 out of 5 stars. 2) Cleanliness - We were \"upgraded\" to a deluxe, which placed us into a first-floor room, which opened up into a semi-private lawn on the ocean. Negatives-- View is partially obstructed by hedges. Millipede and other small bugs constantly coming in and out of the room. 3) Too Big. And this isn't just the maze layout of the hotel, but we felt that b/c of the size, mgmt could not effectively manage the place. Was not a cohesively run resort to improve the overall experience; felt like a bunch of loosely assembled buildings and restaurants combined to form one Sheraton. 4) Starwood Vacation Ownership (aka Starwood's timeshare program) kept leaving vmail daily. Annoying. 5) Internet. If you want to get online, bring your laptop. But who wants to lug their laptop on vacation? Be prepared to spend $0.40 per minute, which is $2 per NYT article you can read -- computers are nice...at least you'll get to use computers with flat panel displays! 6) No Front Lobby. As of mid-October they were renovating their front lobby. So there was no front lobby. Be sure to call them to see if they're done (they said it'd take a \"few\" weeks). 7) Scarcity of Parking. Yes, they do charge extra for parking, but the other 2 hotels we stayed at during the honeymoon did too. The problem is that at the Sheraton, the lots don't fit the # of rental cars that have to park there, so each night people had to park in fire lanes.", "Date": "November 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Sheraton Maui\u201d", "Author": "sunbeachsnorkel", "ReviewID": "UR10825694", "Content": "We booked our wedding group at the Maui Sheraton in November 2007.

From October 21- October 26th we stayed at the Sheraton Maui. From October 27th-October 31st we stayed at the Grand Wailea. We loved the Sheraton Maui, and we absolutely despised the Grand Wailea (you can type in Grand Wailea to read my review). Our rooms were supposed to be ocean view rooms. When we arrived at the front desk, we informed them that we were on our honeymoon and asked them if there was any way possible for us to get a room upgrade. The front desk clerk said that since we were on our honeymoon, if I promised to take care of my wife and be nice to her the rest of my life, she would upgrade us to a deluxe ocean view room for FREE!! The valet quickly came and led our rental car to our building via his golf cart. We stayed in building 6. He unloaded all of our bags for us and showed us to our room. He offered to take my wife and I's picture from our balcony. He also said that because we were honeymooners, the front desk had arranged for someone to go to our room before we got there, and they had placed a complimentary bottle of champagne in our refrigerator. Our view from building 6 was awesome. We were in room 6208 which is on the second floor. The distance from our balcony to the ocean was less than 20 feet. Everyone at the Sheraton Maui bends over backwards to kill you with kindness. When my wife and I were out walking on the grounds, it did not matter whether we passed the housekeepers, the maintenance men, the pool workers, the restaurant workers etc. everyone ALWAYS said hello and ALWAYS asked if there was anything they could do to help us. We ate dinner our first night there at the Reef's Edge Lounge. The food was decent for the price we paid, but we were provided with Hawaiian musical entertainment while we ate. We ate breakfast the majority of the mornings we were there at Keka's Terrace. While $23 per person is more than I would spend for a breakfast buffet on the mainland, the food was well worth the price considering we were in Hawaii. The concierge staff is first class, and they too are very friendly as well as knowledgeable. They set us up with our daily excursions which included: 1. Sunset Luau at Black Rock on the grounds of the Sheraton. 2. Zip Line Tour with Eco Adventures. 3. The road to Hana with Blue Mountain Tour s(4 hour van ride to Hana, and a 45 minute helicopter ride back). 4. Snorkeling Adventure with Safari Boat Excursions Of these, the snorkeling adventure was by far our favorite. This tour was a 6.5-hour snorkel trip on a boat that goes all the way around the Island of Lanai. We were able to experience shipwrecks, remote beaches, cliffs, caves, lava pinnacles, waterfalls, and of course Dolphins..The driver of the boat sets the entire tour to music, which was AWESOME. He anchors the boat at three different locations and allows you to get out an snorkel. Before I ever went to Hawaii, I was terrified about getting into any kind of sea water. This tour made me fall in love with the ocean and with sea life. The least favorite was the road to Hana. Everyone told us this trip was a must see, and do. To my wife and I, it was a waste of money and time. The trip consists of 600 sharp curves in the road, and trips over 50 one lane bridges. You do get to see lots of natural waterfalls and beautiful flowers along the way. The best part of this tour was the helicopter ride back where we got to see natural waterfalls within the mountains that you could not normally see via an automobile. Unless you are just into sharp twisting roads, and just have to see a waterfall, I would suggest skipping the road to Hana. It was not worth the money we paid. We did enjoy the Cliff Dive ceremony that took place on the grounds at the Sheraton every night at sunset. At sunset every night, a young cliff diver honors his heritage each evening by re-tracing footsteps in the sand on Kaanapali Beach. A chant of old Hawai'i begins the progression of our warrior; the echo of the conch shell announces his arrival. He leaves a trail of glowing torches surrounding the lagoon as he makes his way to Black Rock. Upon reaching the summit, he offers his torch to the ocean below, casts his flower lei into the sea; and finally takes the breathtaking dive from Black Rock into the rolling surf below. After his dive into the ocean, he swims to the beach and takes pictures with bystanders. The pool was nice and big. We never had trouble finding a lounge chair. The only thing we disliked about the Sheraton was the maze we had to get through to get from our room to poolside/the restaurants. We had to walk out of our room, take an elevator up one level, walk about 100 yards, take an elevator up the 8th floor of an adjacent building, walk another 50 yards to another set of elevators, then take those elevators to the first floor. It took an entire day to get that figured out. The $20 resort fee is misleading in that we thought we had free Internet access. We went to the business center to check our e-mails one day, and were charged $20 for our 30 minutes of usage. Internet usage is only FREE if you have a laptop, the business center is not free. The rooms at the Sheraton are average hotel rooms. Nothing special at all. I would give them 3.5 stars. But the friendliness of the staff, the cleanliness of the grounds, and all other misc. amenities are 5 star. This is the place to stay for anyone. Hawaii is like any other major city. You can go to all the tourists traps to eat and pay outrageous prices, or you can find out from the locals/concierge where the best places to eat in town are, and you can go there and pay reasonable prices for great meals. I do recommend getting a rental car for transportation needs. The island of Maui is easy to navigate, and for the first time in my life, I found a city where everyone knows how to drive. A friendly tip, do NOT blow the horn at anyone. That is considered rude in Hawaiian customs. If you want to see me rip a hotel to shreds, please check out my review of the Grand Wailea. If that hotel is \"5 star luxury,\" I would recommend staying at the Motel 6 or Red Roof Inn, you would get better service.", "Date": "November 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "mrs_slink", "ReviewID": "UR10457571", "Content": "The Sheraton Maui is set in a beautiful location amongst the Kaanapali beach resorts.

Resort Pro/Con: They don't have a spa, but since they are a Starwood hotel you can get a hotel shuttle to the awesome Westin Heavenly Spa or walk there (which I did). You will not get the 20% discount on spa services as Westin guests do. They also did not tell me that I could use the facility all day the entire day of your service, which might have been nice.

It had been over 20 years since I was in Maui last and I had no idea where to stay as there are so many choices and many different areas to stay in. I must say I picked an awesome hotel. We were more than pleased with our choice. The beach is big and beautiful. The black rock right out in front of the hotel is the best place to snorkel. My daughter swam with turtles most days. They are very friendly and come into the snorkel area a few times a day to look for food on the ocean floor. It was fantastic. The rock is also where they have a nightly cliff diving event. There is this guy who lights all the torches around the property. Then he proceeds to the black rock and lights the few torches there. When he is done and the sun has almost set, he dives off the cliff into the water below. It does not look that high, but it is a neat thing that happens each night at sunset. The hotel pool is endless. At first you think that it is just one large pool, but then you realize it wraps around the property sort of like a lazy river. It is peaceful and beautiful and my kids had the best time in the pool. Outside the property we found lots of food choices. Lahaina is close by. About a 5-10 minute drive. Lahaina is the cutest area with lots of restaurants and blocks and blocks of shops. We did not eat at the hotel. We had a car and found food in Lahaina or near the hotel. We paid a AAA rate of 305.00 per night plus an 18.00 resort fee. Our room had a great view of the pool and the ocean beyond that. We were pleased with our room (nice flat screen TV) and also were very happy with the hotel's valet. It was only 5.00 a night and the valet guys were very fun and helpful. Our favorite island has always been Oahu, but now we are in awe of the Sheraton, it's black rock, the turtles, Lahaina and the island of Maui.

For those used to staying at higher class resorts, you will be dissappointed with the rooms which sadly, are just ordinary and are beginning to show their age from their remodel 10 years ago. Beds are firm (not the Sweet Sheraton Sleeper), pillows are flat, furnishings are worn (scratched here and there) and the bathroom could be taken out of any middle of the road chain. What you get here are great grounds, a wonderful pool (not too big though) and a location along Black Rock which is wonderful. Here is a summary: Pros: - Location along Black Rock is perfect for snorkeling right off of the beach. Good swimming, good views and the rock provides a natural break to other properties - Service. The people here actually seem to do a fairly good job with things and are attentive to your needs (although see cons) - Rooms with ocean views definitely do have ocean views - Rooms with partial ocean views are along the back corners of buildings so you need to be on your lanai to see the ocean - Self parking at no charge is always appreciated and is available next to building 3 and in a parking structure - The pool area is nice and has quite a few chairs scattered about - Nightly , there is a cliff diver along with the torch lighting ceremony at sunset which is fun to watch - The location in Lahaina is good for getting around to other areas. Cons: - Rooms are ordinary. Nothing special here, not even in the same league as the big boys, but Sheraton is Starwood's middle of the road chain, so this is what you'd expect - Food choices. Despite a \"new\" menu at the restaurant when we arrived, there is a gap in food choices. The Lagoon Bar has burgers, nachos, and other greasy bar food (average price $18 for a burger or sandwich), while the main restaurant has your choice of steaks, or fish, or steaks, or fish (average price of $35). The main restaurant does have a prime rib buffet on Friday and Sunday which looked OK. The main bar has about 5 food choices, non of which looked great (although we cheated and ordered some of the starters from the main restaurant menu) and the Japenese restaurant has hibachi style dining which may be OK for bigger groups. What they are missing is something in between the greasy $18 burger and the $40 filet for folks who just want some \"real\" food in a casual setting. - Service. While overall service was great, there were some lapses. Hats off to Jeremy from the bell desk who does a great job in going through everything that the hotel and surrounding area has to offer. Some lapses detracted however. One morning we realized that housekeeping forgot to leave any new towels in our room (just a washcloth). Other items like food taking a bit too long to get despite an empty restaurant were not that great. - We did see the hotel manager (Chip) wandering about which was good to see as he seems to have a good rapport with the staff. Overall, a great stay in a great setting. Since I used StarPoints for the stay, you cannot beat the price. Some recommendations for those coming here: - Hit The Gazebo for breakfast. It's up the coast a bit, tucked away in the Napili Shores condo complex, but is right on the water and has huge breakfasts that are wonderful at great prices. Come early (they open at 7am) though as the line grows and grows and grows. Try a banana mac pancake with their coconut syrup. - For those looking beyond fish and the normal chains, the Thai Chef is a great spot. Bring your own bottle of wine however, as it's a BYOB. - If you are heading to Hana, stop at Charley's for breakfast on the way in Paia. Great food at a great price and right on the way (they open at 7am as well).

The reviews are eerie accurate and depending on your style, the Sheraton will be average to more ritzy type travelers, or minimum \"Above Average\" for travelers just lookin for a nice place to relax with some style. We went to the Sheraton for our honeymoon and it lived up to the hype. My wife and I have never been on a vacation and thought this was the perfect \"First Time\" place. . Here are some pros/cons and in betweens to consider. PROs: *Immaculate grounds *Friendly staff * Excellent location. Whalers Village in walking distance, end of beach next to Black Rock, the sand was baby powder soft! *Nice rooms (nothing to write home about, but who stays in the room all day when your in Hawaii!), w/ spacious lanais. *Great housekeeping and concierge service, *Beautiful wrap around style pool, wasnt cold for us, and we are from Southern Cal. Cons: * As some who stated, the pillows were too soft for my wife and I. Our mattress at home was more comfortable. (The Sheraton claims they are King size, they are not. They are the larger types of a Queen) *Daily Resort fee along with pricey food/drinks Although that is to be expected in Hawaii guys, stop complaining about it, there is no way around it. Its Hawaii! *Microwave in room extra charge (Available upon request) *Fridge was very small ( Chill a 6 pack and a few bottles of water, a pack of lunch meat. Try anything more and your fridge will not cool properly) *No Smoking. Our lanai had a perfect view, perfect for a nice stogie and cognac, but dont try the stogie/cigarettes. As enticing as it may be to light one up, $300 charge! not worth it folks! Beware: If you charge anything to your room (ie room service, food/drinks, cabana rentals) They will place a hold on your card right then and there! I was unaware and called the front desk, I was told that it as a hold on the card to ensure that funds will be paid. Some guests run up a bill and then dont have enough on their card to cover the cost upon check out. That put a damper on us as we had to scramble and have family back home deposit money into our account! There is no Washington Mutual, Bank of America anywhere near this hotel! We wanted to deposit some of our honeymoon money into our accounts and could not. Tips: With an exception to eating at the hotel, the breakfast buffet is well worth it ( $20 per person). You will not find a better deal on all you can eat fresh made omelettes, oj, crepes, etc.. Its def worth it in our opinion, food was very very good. Go anywhere else for breakfast and you could easily shell out more. Walk down to Whalers Village and eat at the Hula Grill, Lelanis. Prices are reasonable, there also is a bar with a good happy hour (Mai Tais are top notch, and more importantly, cheap!) Arrive an hour early to put in a reservation, walk around the village, plenty of stores for souveneirs. Pack light! Guys especially, depending on what you are there for, a few basketball shorts and a cut off T with some sandals/shades/ and a visor is all you need. The weather and casual atmosphere requires nothing else. Ladies, you can get away with a skirt over your bathing suit and blend right in! Call ahead! I called ahead to confirm our reservations and told them we were on our honeymoon and boom!, free upgraded room upon arrival (garden view upgraded to partial ocean view) With that being said, ifyou book online as we did, book the cheapest room which is usually the garden view, and they will upgrade you for free if there are rooms available to do so. We were in building 6, by far the best building as I have read from other tripadvisor guests. The view on the lanai was amazing! Just open up the lanai and doze off to the ocean waves and birds. Overall we would def go back, just make sure you have enough money in your account to immediately cover expenses if you do decide to charge to the room.

The room was nice, but not what I had booked. We asked to switch to a different room and the front desk quickly accomondated our request. The second room was in bldg 6. The view was amazing!! Building 6 is on the cliff and looks directly out into the ocean. Some reviews complained about the location of bldg 6, but we thought it was great. It really is away from the rest of the resort and is very peaceful and quiet. We didn't mind the walk to the pool and beach. It's not as bad as some of these reviews say. The old lobby area in bldg 5 was one of my favorite places. It has a great view of the beach and black rock and was a nice place to watch the cliff diving ceremony.

The buffet is $20 per person if you don't have the vouchers. I was happy we stayed in the Ka'anapali area. It's a great location. The Sheraton was within walking distance of Whaler's Village and a quick drive (5-10 minutes) to Kapalua or Lahaina. There are a several restaurants and shops in Lahaina. There is also a Safeway where we stocked up on beer and wine (drinks at the Sheraton are quite pricey). The pool and beach were nice.

The bed was firm which suited me but my partner found it too hard. There is a fridge which is handy. The room was very quiet which was good because the outside entertainment in the evenings can be very loud. Once you close the windows it cuts it all off. It was a long walk to our room from the car park but that seems to be true of a lot of the rooms here. The hotel pool is nice but it's layout means that there isn't much space for sun loungers. Few of these have shade and most of those 'booked' with towels by 7:30. Later in the day the beds are packed with people shoulder to shoulder. It becomes clear why once you venture onto the beautiful beach next to the pool. Cabanas are $40, sun loungers and an umbrella $35. This can get expensive very quickly. We were there for 10 days and lying on a towel was not how I imagined my trip. This nickel and diming spreads to other things about the hotel. You pay a resort fee for parking of $20 per day despite the fact that pretty much everyone has to drive to get there. This includes internet but that is not something we used at all. The restaurants were very expensive and not very good quality. We ate there twice and thereafter walked to Whalers Village which has more choice, better quality and much lower prices. Lahaina is nearby and that has many choices too. Sheraton do not seem to spend much effort on the restaurants. I have had bad experiences elsewhere too. The snorkelling is goodbut it does get very busy at times because a number of hotels share the same beach. That said I did swim next to a turtle my first morning which was fun.

They have put all of their money, it seems, into keeping the outside nice. Our first night in town we stayed at the 3-Star Royal Laihina next door which we liked. The trouble started when we checked into the Sheraton for our week-long stay. 1. Terrible Location - When we checked in, they told us we had to DRIVE to our Deluxe Oceanfront Room facing Black Rock. There was NO VALET for this wing. Very remote: to get to the lobby, restaurants, pools, etc it takes FIVE ELEVATORS and a very long, hot walk. They offered to drive us back in a Golf Cart to our room, but that wait was 20 minutes. 2. TERRIBLE BEDS - Hotel advertises comfortable \"Sweet SLeeper\" beds. Our bed was HARD AS A ROCK. Plain mattress, no pillowtop...motel-like. Like sleeping on the ground. I've NEVER complained about a mattress in a hotel & couldn't believe I was doing it at a 4-star Sheraton! We called to see if we had the SWEET SLEEPER that was advertised & on our confirmation... NO ONE knew! In our Guest Directory, a Pillowtop was offered on request. When we asked, they brought a thin comforter. The staff never heard of a \"pillowtop\" listed in the book. Our 1st night was SLEEPLESS..the bed was SO HARD & pillows gave no support. Spouse had to sleep on the chair. I envisioned 5 more nights, and told my spouse I couldn't handle the back-ache from the bed, long, hot walk with 5 elevators to and from the lobby, pool, etc. and NO valet while lugging our cooler, beach stuff & souvenirs to and from our room. NOT relaxing or worth $400 a night! 3. OLD, BROKEN ROOMS - Motel-style mattress, broken dressers didn't close, fridge broken.. pee stains on bathroom walls. Not clean. 4. STAYED ONE NIGHT, CHARGED $2000 - Checked another room to salvage our stay. The bed was no different in another room. 1/2 a day dealing w/ all of this..upsetting & stressful! Finally nicely asked if we could check out without penalty. They said that it would be no problem. WRONG! A $2000 charge was waiting for us when we got home! Was told by 2 reps that we'd never checked out! The rep who checked us out credited $400 but charged us $2000 for one-week stay. Finally the charges were straighted out after several phone calls...but it was a huge hassle. 5. HUGE relief to get AWAY from Sheraton's broken dresser, uninformed staff, hard miserable bed, 5 elevators and no valet service. We checked BACK into the 3-star Royal Lahaina next door and was given an amazing view (way better than the \"Black Rock\" view\" at Sheraton) along with a newly renovated bedroom (just like we'd had the first night). Our bed there was to die for... amazingly comfortable. The rooms were updated, modern and WAY cleaner and in WAY better condition that the Sheraton. Valet gladly helped us with our \"stuff\" after long days out and about..and in 2 seconds we were up the elevator and in our room. Everything is convenient at the Royal Lahaina...snorkle shack, pool, amazing Ice Cream and dining room for lunch.

I was really looking forward to checking the property out after having stayed at the Westin 2 years prior. I have never in any of my past travels actually gone through the trouble to ask for a different room. I am typically just happy to be on vacation. =) We had 2 rooms at the Sheraton before we finally landed in Building 6. I really think the rooms need to be re-evaluated as to what their view/description should be. Our first Ocean View was on the second floor and there were multiple plumeria trees growing taller than our balcony. We could only see the beach after standing on one of the chairs on the balcony. I called to explain the issue and they checked into available rooms. They called me back and gave me my new room number in another building and on the top floor (high above the plumeria). We arrived at the new room to find that the view was actually worse. The palm trees were completely obstructing our view of anything (resort, pool, beach) and there was no balcony in this room. This time I went to the desk to talk to them in person and explain that if I was going to receive a garden view room, I would like to at least have my rate adjusted to the garden view rate. We ended up speaking with the evening manager and getting upgraded to building 6. I was a little upset that we were not offered the upgrade prior to spending an hour dragging our luggage around that maze because of our SPG gold status. There was no acknowledgment of our SPG status at check in. Speaking of the Maze... =) I don't know who designed that property but they should have to stay in building 6 just for punishment. It took at least 3 elevators to get anywhere. There were people wondering around holding these little maps they give you at check in. Everyone was lost. It takes a day or two just to figure out what floor or elevator you are supposed to be on to get where you want to go. If it weren't for the snafu on the first day, the resort probably would have been an average stay. The rooms are nice enough though there is only wi-fi in selected public spaces and the pool. The bathrooms were large and clean though they seemed to stop at the tub when they renovated. There is great snorkeling from the beach (great for those leery of snorkeling from a ship in the open ocean). Most of the staff were great. Food prices were typically out of control. We ate in Lahaina quite a bit. They were changing out the lounge chairs around the pool while we were there. The new ones are much nicer and have a cushion. We did have a difficult time finding two chairs together. Lots of people tossing towels on them and then going to the beach. We saw at least 20 chairs in the immediate area that had no one come back to claim the towels. We will be returning to Maui but will not stay at the Sheraton.

Both times we stayed in Wailea (we stayed at the Outrigger which became the Marriott and we loved it!). We decided to come to Maui one month shy of our 5 year anniversary for my husband to run the Maui Marathon. Because all of the marathon events were taking place in Kaanapali we decided to stay in the area, as opposed to Wailea. From our experience on the island we knew that there was a walking path all along the Kaanapali beach area so we chose the Maui Sheraton because we knew it was at the end of the path and we wouldn't have as much tourist traffic going past the hotel or our pool. Of all the hotels in the area, I am glad we chose the Sheraton. The location cannot be beat and for the money, it is a solid, dependable resort (for the most part). From my prior experiences I would have to rate the Maui Sheraton as average. It did not sweep me off of my feet. The bed was okay, the shower was a little less than average. I agree with many other Tripadviser reviewers when they complained about the mildew smell in the bathroom. We were in building 3 with an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153oceanfront\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room and the bathroom was very small and had a mildew odor. I have mold allergies so I was a bit reluctant to stay in the room but it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t HORRIBLE so I decided to deal with it since it was only for 5 days and it was so late at night when we arrived. The bathroom did have Pantene shampoo and conditioner so it was nice to have a well known brand to use. The room was nicely decorated and I am glad they had a refrigerator in the room so we could keep some drinks and snacks cold. The lanai was VERY small. And although we typically don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend a lot of time in our hotel room when we are in Hawaii, it is nice to be able to sit out on the lanai and take in the beautiful scenery. We did not have that opportunity at the Sheraton. However, the lower rooms seemed to have a larger lanai (we were on the 5th floor). The prices at the hotel's restaurants were beyond outrageous. We have been to Hawaii before and are used to the resort prices but I have never seen a place charge $20 for a breakfast omelet (just the omelet - no bacon, no breakfast potatoes, no toast - nothing else with it!). I must say, however, that we had the same waiter for 2 different meals and by the 3rd time he saw us he remembered our names and even came from another area of the restaurant to say hello and ask how our vacation was going. So we were very pleased with the service. We tried to eat off of the hotel premises as much as we could. We really enjoyed our pasta dinner at Longhi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (my husband had to carbo-load before the big race) and we had a typical outstanding dinner at Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (this is most favorite place to eat on Maui). Another minor disappointment for us was from the first day we arrived we received messages from someone in the Sheraton Vacations area (basically looking to sell us a timeshare). They left messages saying they had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome gift\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for us. By the 3rd day of messages I went to the Vacations office just to get them to stop calling. When I arrived I found out that I could not just go and pick up this welcome gift but I actually had to speak to the actually person (sales rep) who had been leaving the messages. I never did go back to pick up my welcome gift. If you are looking to save some money, it is very easy to become a Starwood resorts member on their website (you can sign up for free). If you do this you have an opportunity to save 35% on your meals and to get a good discount on your room rate. Thankfully the hotel allows you to check your bill before you check out (through the TV menu). We found charges to our room that we did not make. I am glad the staff was very responsive in removing the charges \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it just makes me wonder how many people do not review their bills when they check out and pay for food or drinks that they did not order. I know I have mentioned several negative things but all in all we did have a decent experience at the Maui Sheraton.

They also sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne and we had an unexpected lei greeting at check in. Overall, our experience at the Sheraton was very good.

The cleaning lady was very nice, but really didn't do a very good job during our stay. Overall, the staff is very nice, but they do not seem at all happy to be working there which is kind of a downer when your on vacation and in such a good mood.

Any beach resort has beautiful views, snorkeling and diving, gorgeous underwater reefs, etc, many have rain forests and mountain hiking nearby and all give you the atmosphere of the place--wherever that is. So does the Sheraton. Having said that, I will say that the what the Sheraton Maui does, it does very well. It is basically a Vegas production with loads of fake palm trees, pools and waterfalls and a beautiful beach with great snorkeling right from the beach. The rooms are clean and the views are to die for. There is shopping nearby at the Whalers Village and lots of activities going on during the day and the early evening. The bars at the pool area all close by 8PM--so early evening is the keyword. Yes, they have a luau production with hula dancers and fire dancers, as do most of the other hotels in the area. The food at the hotel and in the area is pretty good. It is hard to find any real local food--except the Aloha Mixed Plate, which is really a small lunch place. The biggest problem at the Sheraton is that some rooms are VERY, VERY far away from the main hotel--we were in building 6, which we had to drive to get to. We had a fantastic view of Black Rock, but it took almost 10 minutes to go from our room to the pool--we had to walk to another building, take 2 elevators and a cross walk to get there. it was another good hike to the restaurant and forget about the lobby. God forbid if you forget something or need to go back to your room. There was no transportation available and many people were very unhappy about being \"upgraded\" to this lonely outpost of building 6 and 7. The other problem is that there are very few staff people around to help with directions or other questions. Two good restaurants that I highly recommend are Basil Tomatoes--serves amazing local fish and Italian fish and a place called Fish and Poi which is up the road at Napili Resort. This place had the best local food we had.

The beach (which is public by the way) attached to the hotel is TERRIFIC! Our concierge was nice but not that knowledgable about Maui. The Front Desk behavior was strange...no one is in a hurry for anything. They give you a complimentary Valet Day of parking and then charge you $5/day for the service...don't forget that the valet's are expecting a tip on top of that. Further, you must tell the front desk that you don't want the valet otherwise they automatically charge you....and expect to stand in line for about 15 minutes to do this. The resort is full service and what they don't have they've networked with other hotels up the road (spa for example). My biggest complain is they charge you FOR EVERYTHING. You want a beach chair, $10/per....you want an umbrella, $20/per...you want a cabana, $40/per. You want to sit by the pool, you MUST wear a wrist band regardless of the tan line it might give....may sound like a minor thing, but the security is gestapo-like. We preferred the beach anyway. The bars outside are exorbitantly priced $10/wine in a small plastic cup found at children's birthday parties and $6.00 for beer again in a plastic cup. Do yourself a favor and go into Old Lahaina and stop at the grocery and pick up your own drinks for 1/10 the cost and stock them in the hotel fridge. The hotel menu prices are exorbitant as well. There were TONS of kids wandering around making all sorts of noise. More kids than I would expect at an upscale place like this. Also, the whole place is supposed to be non-smoking; I had to call the hotel security three times. Just sitting out on the lanai enjoying an adult beverage and the fresh air and then \"smokey\" a few rooms down decides to smoke for 2 hours....and you bet it will ruin your fresh air. The hotel grounds are meticulously kept and the views from up above are AWESOME. The water is the clearest I've been in. The problem with Maui in my opinion is that you have to drive EVERYWHERE from the hotel. Contrast that with Waikiki where you can walk everywhere. If you don't want to have to drive to everything, then head to Oahu (Waikiki)....if you don't mind driving, then you'll like Maui. One more thing...the hotel \"gym\" is quite hard to find...you have to go to a particular building, and go to the 8th floor. Once there, you must walk down a hall and take a different elevator down to the 7th floor. Then you must exit the elevator and walk a bit more and you might :>) find it. Plus it's only got 2 ellipticals and 2 treadmills. Sure, they've got about 4 token nautilus machines, but for a place where the room minimum is $500/night, you'd think they'd have a much better facility. All in all we'd choose to stay somewhere else due to the fact that they nickel and dime you for everything and the service isn't up to par with the price you're paying.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Terrible Service\u201d", "Author": "mandc777", "ReviewID": "UR8406897", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton Maui Resort for the first part of our Honeymoon and sadly we didn't feel like we were on a vacation much less a Honeymoon at all.

We called the front desk and they assured us that security was on their way, but after waiting 15 min. we had to call again. Then when we finally got to our room we discovered a large fan/humidifier that had been placed by the beds due to the flooding and carpet damage. Hence our room smelled terribly of mold/wet carpet.

The second day of our Honeymoon consisted of No Luggage still however we found out that the airport had delivered our luggage at 9pm the night we arrived and at 1pm the Next day the hotel had failed to tell us they had our luggage and we were forced to sleep in our clothes. After complaining/commenting several times to the manager on duty about our frustrations the only thing we were offered were 2 drink tickets and they had to be used between 5:30-7:30pm and were only good for One day. We were Very disappointed in the customer service at this hotel and will Not be staying here again.

Departed August 7 Upgraded from an ocean view to a deluxe ocean view in building 6. Nice size room with incredible view but in remote area far from pool and the action. With 2 kids wanted to be closer to the action. Changed rooms after 1st night to building 3. If you have kids, this is the building to stay. Located directly in front of all the activity (pool, night-time music you can enjoy from your balcony, oceanfront room). Of all the hotels on the strip, the Sheraton has the most open space (i.e. walking paths, grass playing area). The Sheraton also has the widest beach area. Even though building 3 is located in the center, their open space makes it feel very comforable. We walked over to the Westin and it was jam packed with people because they do not have the same open space available. Postive-Room location, mini-fri, pool, beach, snorkeling, buffet breakfast ($20/adult, kids free), unlimited number of beach towels you can use at the pool and beach. Negative-Rooms could of been updated, especially the bathroom, there was a mildew smell and that really bothered me. The bathroom in our first room, (building 6) was newer with 100sq feet more space and that was in the bathroom. Rental cost for beach chairs. Sheraton Reservations - recommend to make your hotel reservation directly through Sheraton. We had the 5 Nights for 4 package. We had the 5th night free and 35% off of lunch or dinner at any of their restaurants. This was a deal. Eating at the pool restaurants worked out to be reasonable with this discount. Recommendation: Stop at Walmart at the airport. Buy snacks, beverages, beach chairs ($10/each) and boogie boards ($13/each) and snorkel eqiupment. A big savings compared to renting these things. Take on your trip a soft cooler for beverages and snacks, we hauled it around and again saved money. I give the Sheraton a rating of a 4, not because it was bad, but because there are other hotels that would be more deserving of a 4.5-5.0 rating (i.e. Hyatt, more upscale). We chose the Sheraton based on the Fodors recommendation. Also, we stayed at the Marriott Waikiki for one night and this hotel is a definite 4.5 so I felt I had to rate the Sheraton lower since the Marriott room was far superior to the Sheraton. When we return to Maui again, we will not even stay in Kannapali as Wailia is far more elegant, more of the Beverly Hills of Maui.

The Sheraton, while still a perfect spot for honeymooners, was full of families with kids, and the hotel staff was quite adept at dealing with children and helping them to feel so relaxed and welcome. The accessibility of all the activities at The Sheraton made it so easy to do whatever you want without any effort or hassle. The snorkling was excellent right off the hotel beach and, if you want to take a sunset cruise, like we did, the concierge can book it for you and the boat takes off five minutes from the hotel. This is a great way to get a view of West Maui from the water on a 60 foot catamaran, with an open bar and hors d'oeuvres on a 2 hour boat ride.

This was our first time to Hawaii. The Sheraton Maui is about 50 minutes from the Kahului airport and its a very scenic drive when you get to the mountains and see the ocean. You must take highway 380 to highway 30 to get there. We were told not to go the northern way because of very bad roads. Kaanapali Beach was a great location for shopping, restaurants, activities, etc. without being commercial. We booked a garden view room for 6 nights but received a complimentary upgrade to an ocean view room. The ocean view room just made our trip! We were at the top of the cliff on Black Rock in building #6. The room was great and the king size bed and bedding were heavenly! We were on ground level so we had a great patio where we spent alot of time just staring out at the beauty of the ocean waves and boats passing by. Everything was superclean. The room location was quiet and private but a little confusing getting to the main parts of the hotel. We had to go on two or three different elevators to make it to the beach level or lobby but we laughed about it. The walk through the hotel had breathtaking views and wonderful Hawaiian breezes because of the openness of the halls. The resort grounds were beautifully landscaped and staff were constantly working to keep it that way. We'll never forget the smell of Maui! Flowering shrubs everywhere! The staff always greeted us with an \"Aloha\" and all staff were dressed very professionally. We ate lunch a few times at the outdoor hotel restaurant near the pool where you can dine casually at an umbrella table in your beach attire with a great view of the beach. There was a fantastic singer several evenings singing contemporary Hawaiian--I think he said his name was \"Mondo\". The relaxing music and tiki torches glowing made it a wonderful atmosphere. The beach was great and my husband said the snorkeling was great around Black Rock. He saw a sea turtle and many large, beautiful angel fish. (Wear flip flops on the beach because the sand gets very hot!) There were very nice people vacationing at the Sheraton--couples and families. We always felt very safe. Our part of the beach was the best. We rented an umbrella and chairs so we could be closer to Black Rock. Definitely have dinner at the Hula Grill and Barefoot Bar behind Whaler's Village. Just a 5-10 minute walk down the sidewalk from the Sheraton. Great food, atmosphere, Hawaiian entertainment! We attended the top rated Old Lahaina Luau (book several weeks early) only 10 minutes by car. You do need to rent a car. Lahaina is a great area to spend time. My husband took a surfing lesson there and we had a great breakfast at a corner blue open-air restaurant called \"Longhi's\". One morning we drove up to Kapalua for breakfast and drove around the beautiful area. We also drove half of the Hana Highway and back and went on a 45 min. helicopter tour of the Hana area and Haleakala volcano. Take Dramamine if you have any least bit of motion sickness problems before either of these activities. I thought I'd be ok but the helicopter ride wasn't for me. My husband loved it. Blue Hawaiian Helicopters are the best. It was very smooth and beautiful views. The pilot, Dave, was a great tour guide. While we were in Kahului near the airport, we stopped at a great little museum called the Bailey House. A very kind lady named \"Lani\" gave us alot of historical information on Hawaii. It is definitely worth the time -about an hour-spent. We flew Hawaiian Airlines to Oahu for a whole day to see Pearl Harbor, Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. Pearl Harbor is a must see but we were happy to get back to Maui. We hope to go back to Hawaii in a few years and we would definitely stay at the Sheraton Maui again. The Hawaiian culture and people are just beautiful. We wish we would have stayed a few more days. We needed more time on the beach but thought we needed to see the other sights while we were there, too. (Ten days would be great if you're going to do it all.

My wife and I went for our honeymoon last year and were blown away by the sights, smells, and experience at the Sheraton. We were upgraded to a king ocean view from a queen garden view at no cost. There is also a lot to be said for the location! Close to Whaler's Village you can dine at the food court there or grab small snacks at the mini store located there if you're trying to save some money. Sir Wilfred's there has fantastic coffee! We only ate at the restaurant one night and while it was ok, we would much prefer to have dined another night in Lahaina at David Pauls. The location next to Black Rock also makes for wonderful snorkeling at all hours of the day and in such close proximity to your quarters! Snorkeling gear can be expensive if you rent from the hotel so my wife and I went through a third party. My only qualm with the Sheraton, and I imagine any hotel, is that in order to get a good beach chair near the pool you must get up no later than 5:15am. We're from the Midwest so we were thrown off on our sleep anyway and were waking up that early but saw \"squatters\" who would wake up place towels on the chairs and then go back to sleep until 8 or 9.

We had an ocean view room that included a pretty view of the garden area. The doors and hallways are outside, but that is a wonderful thing in Hawaii with the beautiful tradewind weather. The room was nice enough although there was a ton of dust behind the head posts. The carpet, bedding, and bathroom, however, looked and smelled clean and fresh. The comforters and linens were soft and comfortable, but my husband and I felt the mattresses and pillows were too soft which made sleeping uncomfortable for us. We woke up every morning with sore backs and necks, but it really depends on what type of mattress a person is used to sleeping on. We are just used to firm beds. They have a decent sized mini fridge and a small, but clean bathtub with a detachable showerhead that can be set at two height levels. The pool is a lot of fun - my kids loved the little mini slide and my husband and I loved the way we could travel from one area to another without ever getting out. It is a nice little excursion to swim from the kiddie pool side to the deeper end by traveling through narrow waterways under little bridges and past miniature waterfalls. The beach was also very nice, but it was a little windy during our stay, so little sandstorms kept stinging our skin. The staff was friendly and helpful and they left messages to pass on bits of information regarding problems with some services and to remind us of our checkout time. It was quite a hike to our room, but we love walking, so this was not a problem for us. if you have difficulty getting around, however, you may want to request a room closer to the lobby and pool area.

I figured I could live with a less than fantastic room since I wouldn't be spending much time in it. I was pleasantly surprised with the Sheraton and would certainly return. We received a warm welcome at check-in and I immediately liked the lay-out of the property. While surrounded by highrise (ugly) condos and hotels, the Sheraton has low, sprawling buildings surrounded by a large lawn. I liked the relaxed, open feeling provided by the low-slung architecture. Our rooms (two connecting ocean front - not deluxe) were perfectly fine. They were clean (freshly shampooed carpets, too), not particularly large, but pleasant. Bathrooms were a bit tight and no separate shower, but fine. Views of the ocean, Black Rock, lawn, were beautiful. The beach was fantastic. My children had never snorkeled before. We took advantage of the free snorkel lessons poolside (extremely helpful for beginners with info on fitting mask, breathing, hand signals and pool practice). Then, we took to the ocean and immediately found ourselves surrounded by hundreds of tropical fish, within 15 feet of shore. This is a great snorkeling locations for beginners and kids - the Black Rock extends underwater into a coral mass that attracts all sorts of beautiful fish and sea turtles. We saw several large sea turtles during our stay - the kids swimming right alongside them. (Don't touch the turtles - they are a protected species and we were told it is against the law to touch them.) We rented a cabana for $40 a day - well worth it to keep the sunburns at bay but it does add up. We did not eat dinner at the resort so cannot comment on the restaurants beyond the breakfast buffet (good) and poolside sandwiches and salads (serviceable). Our best dinner by far was at Gerard's in Lahaina. David Paul, also in Lahaina, was excellent as well. I'o was good, not great. Sansei, a sushi place in Kapalua was noisy and crowded but pretty good sushi. Plantation Inn, also in Kapalua has a beautiful room and views of Molokai but very expensive and merely good - not great - food. Overall, it was a fantastic family vacation. The threadcount could have been higher on the bed linens and the bathrooms could have been roomier and spiffier, but we were comfortable and well taken care of.

It is on the very end of a small strip of resorts on an amazing beach with excellent snorkeling. There is a cliff on the property that has cliff diving shows at night. Our room was clean and comfortable (love those beds). We were on our honeymoon and were upgraded and received a wine and cheese basket. The view from our oceanview room could not have been more beautiful. I would recommend staying on the main area (not up on the cliff) so you are closer to everything. I wouldn't say the staff was overly friendly though. Not rude or anything but not exceptional. The resort is very expensive, especially the poolside snack bar but everything is expensive in Hawaii so we expected that. The formal dining room wasn't bad but we much preferred going to into town in Lahaina to have dinners at one of many excellent restaraunts. You must have Hula Pie which is made at Kimo's but you can also get it at some other places.

They had trouble sorting this out and we ended up having our first night in a deluxe ocean view room (I'm just putting this to explain why we saw so many rooms).

Everyone at the resort were more than accomodating. Any requests including pulling up our car to valet were always promptly met. Just know that this is Maui hence if you choose to eat there, you will drop some bucks.

I could not have been more happier with the room when we arrived, the view was amazing, the room was clean and had beautiful Sheraton sweet-sleeper beds with fluffy soft pillows!! We noticed that Building 3 rooms were being renovated while we were there. The hotel is spread out so you have plenty of room without being on top of other buildings. The lawns & garden grounds were immaculate and there were hammocks around that you could just relax on. We had breakfast each morning in Keka'a Terrace which was a beautiful buffet with freshly squeezed juices, freshly made omlets & pancakes ...yum!! Breakfast was about $20 each, not too bad price for a 4-5 star hotel. We also had room service one night on our balcony. There was nightly live entertainment at the restaurant and pool bar which you would watch or just sit back and listen from your balcony. We went snorkelling at Black Rock one morning, hire equipment available at the water sports desk for reasonable hire charge $20 a day or $8 per hour. The fish at Black Rock were beautiful and just swim around you as if you are not there. The hotel pool was fantastic with plenty of lounge chairs available and not being overcrowded.

I would definitely recommend if you stay there do not eat there go to Whalers Village or Lahaina and do not go to the Luau it s expensive and the food was cold and not very tasty, do Old Lahaina Luau. If you snorkel do not spend money on snorkeling boats just rent the snorkels from Boss Frogs which is much cheaper.

The hotel ground are absolutely gorgeous and you cannot find a better beach in Maui. The sand is beautiful and clean. The water is beautiful and clean as well - no rocks/seaweed etc at all. You can run right down into the water with no reservations at all.

Trade winds make it cooler than it would be other wise which is a gift during the day and still nice at night. It also helps with humidity - we travel to the Caribben alot and always feel like we need a shower after dinner because you sweat so much there - not true at all in Maui (in May anyway!).

I would suggest this only for the adventurous. The beachside loading was also a challenge. It is all ok I guess if you have on your bathing suit, bring several towels, and DONT bring anything valuable because there is a good chance it will get wet. The upside - after the beating we took at sea we came in and just cruised up and down the beach to watch the sunset and this part was nice and romantic....and the sunset was amazing...but I am still not sure it was worth it. So overall we really LOVED Maui and the Sheraton. We had an 8 hour flight but I am certain that we will still return.

Booked a package deal through Orbitz with their Hawaii sale and opted against car rental. This trip was a little over our budget so we researched all the ways to cut corners and have a great time without charging up the credit cards. Took a cab from the airport to the hotel-was $90 plus tip each way-an airport shuttle would have been cheaper but we didn't set up in advance. Upon arrival to the resort we were told we had been upgraded from our garden view room to a partial oceanview room with 2 double beds if that was okay. We agreed and then found out that room was not yet clean so an available deluxe ocean view with a king bed was offered and we jumped at the chance. We were in building two room 2420 (fourth floor) and the room was immaculate-no mold or old bathroom fixtures. This room appreared to be recently remolded because the carpet was in excellent condition and the entire room was squeaky clean. Our mini fridge was super cold and our balcony had a great view of the property/pools/black rock/ and the ocean. We never ate or ordered drinks from the Sheraton. We immediately walked over to Whalers Village and purchased snacks from the ABC store. For breakfast and lunch we ate at the food court in Whalers Village and for dinner we ate at the Whalers Village restaurants. Our favorite meal was suprisingly at the Hula Grill (excellent filet and porterhouse steaks), we did not enjoy our meals at the Rusty Harpoon, and although we got a great oceanview on the second floor of Leilanis, I felt their filet mignon was not nearly as good as the one I had at the Hula Grill previously. One night we took the complimentary Westin Shuttle into old Lahaina for dinner at Moose McGillyCuddys. The shuttle drops you off at Kobes, and there is Kimos, Bubba Gump Shrimp, Oyster Bar and Cheeseburger in Paradise all there on front street along with shopping. The shuttle also will drop you off at the Lahaina Cannery Mall right by a safeway grocery so you can really stock up on food. The beach is public but the cleanest I've seen-no seaweed or debris. The snorkeling at Black rock is amazing, but watch out for the crazies jumping off the cliff above. My husband saw a porcupine puffer fish, dog face pufferfish, and a giant sea turtle among other tropical fish. We opted not to rent the beach chairs ($40/day for a double chair with a pull up shade). Instead we headed early every morning to the pool for a shady spot and unlike the other rude guests who laid out towels and then left for hours, we napped by the pool in the shade and enjoyed paradise. We had a wonderful time and were glad we hadn't booked a condo at the Whaler-which was plan B. We were a little timid about the Sheraton due to the cost, but it was well worth it. We had absolutely no complaints about the service or resort. The $18/day resort fee sucks. The beach was not as good as Cancun, but more comparable to the Carribean. The water was mostly clear and the sand is more golden and very hot. The pool was very cold and takes some getting used to. There is a heated jacuzzi and waterfalls/small slide along the lazy river connecting the childrens pool with the adult deep pool. I am not sure why this resort is rated so highly for families with small children on this review forum. We are a young couple celebrating a romantic anniversary and thought the setting to be perfect. After walking the beach walk and seeing all the other properties you will find that none compare to the Sheraton. With the best beach, blackrock, amazing pools and close proximity to Whalers Village-the Sheraton misses nothing.

Getting around the property was easy. Room: We were upgraded from a Garden view to an Ocean view...what a great suprise...although if the hotel has the rooms available, I don't see why they would not do it as it really goes a long way in your impression of the hotel. thank you Sheraton. the room itself was quite big with a comfortable bed, flat screen TV, large bathroom with seperate room for toilet. My only complaint was our particular rooms shower was a bit old and in need of an upgrade. Everything else in the room (TV/BED/TOILET/SINK/FRIDGE/CARPET) seemed to have been upgraded in the last year or less, so it's weird that the shower did not get any attention yet. Pools: Pool and service at the pool were great. Really fun to swim the canals. Beach: Excellent location next to Black Rock and great snorkling. the Sheraton even has free snorkling lessons for all guests. Dining: My wife and I did not eat here because there are so many great options around the island so I can't comment on the food. Grounds: Very well maintatined...granted, we did see some areas that could use attention, but nothing that out-of-the-ordinary. A cigarette butt here and there and some torn up grass. Again, the place looks fantastic!!!! If you are thinking of staying in West Maui, I would highly recommend the Sheraton, we strolled to the other resorts along the beach and while we did not actually go IN them, most of the major resorts have similar pool areas and beaches...although the closer you get to the Hyatt, the smaller the beach becomes.

The clean rooms are a credit to the staff. The luggage people do it well. The bed and furnishings are OK but those extra soft pillows cause more problems for a sound sleep than otherwise. . Not so good..... The bath/shower set up is poor as is the really hot water supply The \"fridge\" could not chill a bottle of drink in 3 days. The room was draught ridden and with the cool Tradies I never needed the air conditioning at any time which saved electricity The nickle and diming[we call it penny pinching] is really sad.

I had booked the cheapest room (garden view) for our family of 4 during Spring break and was pleasantly surprised that we were upgraded to an ocean view on a cliff in building 6 (Hale O Ka Moana). Another bonus was that this building, though a distance from the pool and beach, had its own free parking close by. It had the convenience of a small hotel with the amenities of a first class resort. Although we had to walk and take a couple elevators to get to the pool/beach, the walk was a pleasure with beautiful views everywhere and a peaceful lobby on the eighth floor, open and airy, overlooking the ocean. There was a \"kodak moment\" at every turn. The pictures that the Sheraton has on their web site do not do justice to the pool which is a beautiful flowing river type made to appear as though it is carved out of lava rock. We appreciated the ambiance of the Sheraton even more after we took a tour of the Marriot timeshare property down the beach. Although their units are very nice, the architecture of the towers has a prison feel and their pool, which is also very beautiful, was so crowded that it gave me a very tense feeling when we were led through it. I was a bit concerned that a regular hotel room would feel cramped and that a condo unit may have been a better choice, however I felt the room we had was spacious enough with a wide entry, ample closet space, microwave and refrigerator. I would recommend that the Sheraton replace the double beds with 2 queens, but the beds were comfortable and not rock hard like most hotel beds. Although our room was on the second floor, it was actually the ground floor due to the cliff. I really preferred this ground floor location since our lanai was not enclosed and we were able to walk out onto the lawn area; it added to the open feeling and we were able to whale-watch from our lanai. The Keka'a Terrace restaurant at the Sheraton had a nice setting but the food was not great and the menu limited. There are much better restaurants nearby at Whaler's Village. I recommend the Hula Grill barefoot area for value and quality and the Lahaina Fish Company on Front Street in Lahaina for very casual dining set over the water and great food. If we get the chance to return to Maui I would not hesitate to stay again at the Sheraton, although it is an older property the style of architecture with multiple separate buildings is far superior to the modern box-like prison structures of most large resorts.", "Date": "April 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort in Paradise\u201d", "Author": "lizbonne", "ReviewID": "UR7291956", "Content": "The Sheraton was a great resort.

The views of the ocean and of Kaanapali beach were unbelievable. We had hot sunny weather during our stay. Most of our trip was spent in Whalers Village, in Lahaina town, or on Kaanapali beach. The snorkeling was great at Black Rock, but we had to get to the beach by 7:30am every morning to beat the crowds (even at that time, there were already people snorkeling in the ocean). We saw many varieties of fish (trigger fish, angelfish, tangs, pufferfish - but unfortunately, no sea turtles). The ocean was quite rough, but that didn't deter people from having a good time. The only drawback was we witnessed a woman having a cardiac arrest right on the beach, and although the paramedics tried CPR on her for 45 minutes, she didn't make it. That was the only negative part of our trip. Dining: We had dinner at Leilani's on the first night and watched the beautiful sunset, it was absolutely gorgeous. We also had lunch at Bubba Gumps in Lahaina (a great experience - we had a window seat by the ocean, and fed fish with the crackers provided at our table). The food was excellent - that was probably our most memorable meal of the entire trip. We also had dinner at Hula Grill twice (also very good food). Try the lava flow drink, it's to die for!! The mandatory resort fee was a rip off to us, as we didn't have a laptop to use for the free internet, and since we took a shuttle, the free parking was pretty much useless to us. Also, if you don't want to pay for the beach chairs and umbrella, you should get to the beach early in the morning and just find a spot on the sand to sit on. We were at the beach by 7:30am every morning, and would leave by 10:00am to go do some shopping in Whalers or in Lahaina. By 10:00, the beach gets very crowded, and the sun can get pretty intense!!

Our room was in building 6 on the cliff. Our accommodations were beautiful and the building was very secluded which is what we wanted. You could hear and see the whales from our Lanai. The pools were absolutely beautiful and the beach was the best location along Kaanapali Beach. Snorkeling was great at Black Rock. We saw several sea turtles and lots of fish. They had send champagne up to our room and the concierge was very helpful in giving recommendations and also making reservations for us. The walk along the beach is beautiful. You can walk all the way to the other end and back which takes about 45 min. It is just a real short walk to Whaler's Village where there is a nice shopping area and a lot of restaurants. Our favorite restaurant in Whaler's Village was the Hula Grill. It was fantastic. The town of Lahaina is only a 10 minute drive and there are also several wonderful restaurants there and lots of shopping, art galleries. Would recommend Cheeseburger in Paradise, Pacifico's, Mama's Fishhouse, Hula Grill, Bubba Gumps, We did the Feast of LeLe Luau. Five course meal served by our own waiters at a table on the beach. It was very romantic and more personable. Highly recommend. Book ahear online as it fills up quick. Rent a car and do the Road to Hana trip on your own. What lovely views. Definitely eat at Mama's Fish House! Make reservations. Recommend taking the Trilogy Excursions day trip over to Lanai. Leaves from Lahaina Harbor. It was a great trip and the food was wonderful. Make reservations ahead. The Sheraton has the best beach on the Kaanapali strip area! The staff was wonderful and the resort was very clean. Great Black Rock Mai Tais by the pool!

The hotel's location next to Black Rock made it ideal for snorkeling. The water was not the calmest (because of a week of storms), but there were plenty of fish to see. And, the sunsets were amazing. Each day, many people gathered on the beach or near the pool to watch the sun set directly into the sea. This was immediately followed by the cliff-diving ceremony and the lighting of the torches on Black Rock. What was nice was the extra touches the resort had. Each day, they had some Hawaiian cultural offerings. One day, two locals made fishes out of palm fronds. Another day, they had ukelele lessons. One day, they had hula dancers. We didn't try many of the restaurants at the hotel (they were a bit pricey), but we did have a couple lunches at the Pool Bar. The food was good and somewhat reasonably priced. The only (minor) criticism I would have is that the hotel needs a bit more shopping. There's really only one store, and it sells sundries and souvenirs (at somewhat high prices).

The rooms were clean, adequately sized and the property had the usual assortment of restaurants and nearby high-end shopping places.

Starting from the check-in through the rooms, concierge, pools, beach - everything was great. ROOMS: We had a regular garden view room booked and upon check-in tried to upgrade with no luck. Although, the check-in desk did try and do their best (for 15 mins trying all floors and buildings) to get us upgraded - hey, it was holiday season!! PROs: Spacious, comfortable, clean, well-appointed. Small empty refrig., two double beds (Sheraton Sweet Sleeper but I still prefer the Westin Heavenly beds), spacious (but not very private) balcony. Marbled bathroom was also large and in good condition. Room service was responsive. CONs: View (was not really garden). Entertainment (TV) was not up to par. POOLS: The pool itself is large and divided into small sections - all connected by \"rivers\". Waterfalls and a small 6 ft. slide are to be found while you meander the waters. There is a children's (Keiki) pool on one side (1.5 ft) connected to the larger pool, which is where we camped every morning. There is also an \"adults\" section (although it wasn't restricted to adults) with an 8ft deep end. PROs: Large pool hence uncrowded, ample lounge chairs under sun and shade, courteous and friendly pool attendants, enough supply of towels and swim rental equipment. CONs: Cold water (approx 68F), pool service desk closes by 5 PM (gets less busy - at least in the winter, so don't blame them; pool open until late), swim rental equipment pricey (be sure to bring your own snorkeling gear and inflatables), lounge chairs - although enough - were the regular strap type (Westin had cushioned with pillows - ah!), beach chairs and umbrella rentals pricey ($35/day) and always booked, ditto for poolside cabanas ($75/day) - so book in advance of getting here. BEACH: The beach is beautiful. There is some erosion, but it was fabulous. Black Rock (Lava runoff into the ocean) is right off the Sheraton on one end. The snorkeling at Black Rock is really nice - don't have to take the boat to Molokini and waste time driving to the pier and all of that. It's available to you right here. I rented a window boogie board (had a clear plastic see-thru window on the top end of the board) and took my little kids over to see the fish and sometimes, turtles. It's literally 50-100 ft. out where the fish are plenty and visible. And water is MUCH warmer than the pool - not Caribbean warm, but was probably 75F. OTHER HOTEL SERVICES: KIDS ACTIVITIES - although there was no Kids' club, there were enough activities around the pool to keep the kids busy. Hourly lessons varied thru the entire week - Ukulele (hawaiian guitar) lessons, hula dance, coconut husking and weaving, painting, coconut leaf crafts. There were also pool races and treasure/scavenger hunts, etc. with some very nice prizes. LUAU - every Wednesday. $80/adult, $40/child 6 and over. Would rate it B or B+. But get there at least 1 hour prior to just stand in line else you end up sitting at the back. Ample buffet style food and set drinks for open bar (no martinis available!) CONCIERGE - very helpful and the two of them are also very busy. Also found the vacations desk in the lobby helpful with information on the island. TENNIS - two courts behind building 3 - stay here if you plan on tennis. GOLF - Kaanapali Golf course offers discounts for Sheraton guests - must show room key. Golf course grounds (2 of the tees) opposite hotel. PARKING - $5/day for valet (1st night free). Ample free parking but parking structures near entrance to resort and behind buildings 1 and 2. Smaller parking lot near bldg 3 and 4 - very convenient. Not sure about the other buildings. GROUNDS - Well-kept and immaculate but not as much flora as you would expect.

Large, clean, plenty of space for playing both in the water and in the sand. Located at the end of the Kaanapali walkway, there weren't a lot of people constantly walking buy, giving you a sense of being close to the action, but not in the middle of it. The Westin is located right next to Whalers Village, but the constant foot-traffic and narrow beach take away from the Maui feel. The Hyatt property looked amazing, but it was located at the other end of the Kaanapali walk-way, on a very narrow strip of beach. You'd have to take a walk with all of your gear each day if you wanted to spend it out on the beach. In the end, if you plan on being on the beach the majority of the time, the Sheraton is the ONLY choice for you. If you plan on spending all your time at the pool, the Sheraton is still a great choice, but the Westin and Hyatt have superior pools. (Size, detail, etc.) While the Sheraton's pool isn't the most dynamic, the location away from the walking trail gives you more privacy than the other two hotels I mentioned. As previously mentioned in other posts, buying the book \"Maui Revealed\" really is the best first step toward planning your vacation. We stopped at KMart as soon as we landed and picked up water, beer and other snacks to keep in our hotel. With the high food prices at the resort, we were very happy that we did this. We also rented our snokle gear at the Maui Dive Shop in Whalers Village for about $25 a week - MUCH cheaper than the prices as the resorts and very convenient location for pick-up and return. So in the end, as a young couple (not on our honeymoon), we truly enjoyed the Sherton.

My wife and I have two daughters, ages seven and four. Because of this we booked an Ohana Suite. When we got to the Sheraton and Valeted (first day free, $5/day thereafter) we were directed straight to the bell desk where they had our check in materials already ready even though we were there slightly before check in time. We were taken straight to our room. All the Ohana suites are in building one, which is the closest building to the lobby. The Ohana suites are perfect for families with young kids. The bedroom has two double beds, and the main room has a family room area, and the Murphy bed is comfortable and easy to pull down from the wall. Plus the room has a medium sized refrigerator, plus a microwave. The main room has a large walk in closet, so there's plenty of room to store your bags once you unpack. The bathroom is huge, with a separate toilet , plus a bath with shower and a separte solo shower. The location is also key. The rooms are right next to the kids pool, which our youngest loved. Our room was on the ground floor, which meant we were roughly 20 feet from the pool, and we had an ocean view also. The pool is nicely set up with the kids pool on one end, which leads to a winding \"river\" which ultimately opens to the main large pool. This way most of the guests with kids are on one end of the pool area, and anyone who wants to avoid families can. The Sheraton's other main selling point is the beach. They probably have the best beach on Kaanapali of any hotel. The water was actually warmer in the ocean than at the pool, although both were plenty warm. We rented a beach cabana one day to try and stay out of the sun a little, and that worked out great. Food was only OK at the hotel. We had the breakfast buffet most days. For just two people it's a little pricey ($22/person) but since kids eat free for a family of four it's a decent deal. We also ate at Tappan Dan's for dinner one night, which is basically a Benihanna type of restaurant, and was pretty good. For lunch you can get burgers, hot dogs and sandwiches pool side, although they're a little expensive. Whalers village is only a short walk down the beach, so we spent a lot of time there.

We decided to try a different hotel on our 3rd trip and were so disappointed that we went back to the Sheraton this time! If you love the beach, snorkeling, or diving and can splurge, then this may be the resort for you! You cannot beat the location--it's right on Black Rock on Ka'anapali beach...amazing snorkeling and diving basically right outside your door. The lagoon-style pool is fantastic too (and there's a nice children's area as well). The resort is pretty spread out so you end up doing a lot of walking, but the grounds are absolutely gorgeous, and my husband and I enjoyed our strolls through the grounds and on the beachfront sidewalk down to Whaler's Village. Try to get an ocean front room in building 4 (Hale Nalu)...you will not be disappointed! The rooms are very spacious and the beds are very comfortable--they have upgraded the mattresses since our first trip in 2000. Eat there only if you must--the food is OK, but there are so many other places in Maui to get a fabulous meal (hint, hint...get the Maui Revealed book!) that it would be a shame to spend your money at the Sheraton any more than is absolutely necessary.

It is situated near black rock which is where you want to be. Snorkeling, beautiful waves, great piece of sandy beach. People from all over the island know to come to this beach! The pool is nice too... It's quite large and there's a lazy river that runs throughout the pool area. You have to fight for chairs sometimes, but just wake up early - dont sleep your vacation away! Lahaina is by far the best town in Maui for shopping and food. The Sheraton is so close and there's even have a trolley that will take you the mile or so down the road. Also, they upgraded us to one of the two top suites for only $100 more a night. This room is usually nearly 1k a night, but we only paid $400 for it. This is a bargain if you know how expensive other average rooms cost. We were right on top of black rock! We are owners at the Westin Ocean Resort & Villas, but we have a very nice place in our hearts for the Sheraton. It is ideal for everyone.

Use the valet service - it is worth the $5 daily charge to not have to walk to and from the garage, and they are very quick to bring your car. Our room was fabulous, the bed comfortable, and enough space to stretch out. I cannot say enough about the staff at the Sheraton - always a smile on their face and an aloha. Remember - you are on an island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean - it is going to be humid and a bit musty - it's paradise, not the desert. The beach is breathtaking, and the views are spectacular from every room (even the mountains views). The best deals can be found at Whalers Village a short walk down the beach path - breakfast at Rusty Harpoon is delicious, the view incredible, and much cheaper than the buffet at the Sheraton.

They even wished us a happy anniversary! We were given leis and escorted with our luggage to the room, the bellman stopping here and there to point of things of interest. The Our front door faced the West Maui Mountains, and below us was the self-parking lot which made things easy for us when we wanted to go somewhere. A few minutes after checking in, the bellman returned with a bottle of complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary. Inside the room we had a good-sized safe, coffeemaker with Kona coffee, and refrigerator. There were complimentary robes for our use while we were there. The bathroom was nice. The king-sized bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in! The lanai wasn't large, but there was plenty of room for the table and two chairs there, and sitting there in the morning, listening to the birds, the rolls of the ocean and whisper of the palms became one of my favorite things to do. Housekeeping was good. Never had a problem with them at all. On the morning of our anniversary we left very early to see the sunrise at Haleakala, and when we returned, they must've noticed the anniversary cards on the dresser because they draped our leis nearby in the shape of a heart--a very sweet touch. The grounds are lovely, right on Ka'anapili Beach, at Black Rock. Great snorkeling there. We rented a cabana one day and a gazebo by the pool another day. The pool is a lazy lagoon, beautiful and relaxing, with separate areas for the kiddies and adults. The meandering turns often left you in secluded spots where you felt like you were the only ones there. Plenty of lounge chairs, though if you want a particular spot, you'd best go down early. Poolside service for the bar and food was good too. The cliff diving ceremony at sunset is a wonderful touch. We managed to catch it twice during our stay.

We got a terrific deal due to a special package offered by Starwood Vacations. They lured us with an incredible price in the hopes that we would take the tour of their new Vacation Ownership (aka TIMESHARE) resort up the road next to the Westin. We were under absolutely no obligation to do so, but did anyway since we got some great additional incentives. The package was for 5 nights, but we added an extra night at regular rates because we wanted more time on the island. There was absolutely no hassle in doing this. TIP: Join the Starwood Preferred Guest Program (for FREE!) and you will get a discount on the room rate! When we arrived, we were told that we had been upgraded to an Ocean View room, but it had two double bed, and there was no way they could find us another room that night (it was 10:15 PM). We took it the first night, but decided that we really wanted to share a bed since this was a romantic getaway. We were moved to a garden view room, which was fine since we live near the beach in Southern California and didn't care about seeing the water. Unfortunately, there was a problem with the air conditioner in this room (3129) which left the room very humid and smelling of mildew. We were moved to our final room (3501), which had a problem with the air conditioner staying on 100%, making it way too cold, and the toilet SCREAMING when the water was filling the tank. A call to maintenance got both the problems resolved within the two hours that we were out of the room on a shopping trip. TIP: Stock up on drinks and snacks at the 24 hour Safeway in Lahaina, 10 minutes away. The only problem that couldn't be solved was the fact that we were right next to the elevator, so starting at 5:45 AM it got noisy. Also, we could hear water running in adjacent (above and below) rooms through the pipes all hours day and night. All of the staff members were extraordinarily nice except for the front desk person who made our last room change. We stated our problems with the room very clearly and without making any demands whatsoever, but she acted as though she was doing us a great favor (\"Someone else that is arriving today is supposed to have that room, so you had better go check it to make sure it is ok.\" - why even tell us that we were taking someone's room?). As we walked through the halls and walkways we were always greeted as we passed by staff members. We definitely felt like guests, not customers. The quality of the room was excellent. The bed was very comfortable. The showers have adjustable massage or spray action and the water pressure is more than adequate. The bath is a shower/tub combo. In the standard rooms the toilet is in the bathroom, as well as a single sink. The bathroom was always well stocked with towels, soaps, and shampoo, and is equipped with a makeup mirror and hair dryer. Missing from the bathroom is a ventilation fan, the addition of which would reduce steam and other bathroom problems. The furnishings were adequate in number and quite comfortable. The closet was large enough for our needs, but since we brought too many articles of clothing, we had to call down to order and extra dozen hangers, which were delivered quickly. The in-room (in the closet) safe mounted to the floor was huge - I stored my 15.4\" widescreen laptop and digital SLR camera comfortably with plenty of room to spare. On our small lanai there was a small round table with broken glass and only one chair. The higher you go in floor, the smaller the lanai (the ground floor room lanai was big enough to host a small party). The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and for the most part well maintained. Honestly, we didn't have a chance to experience them much since we were always out enjoying the island. On our last day there we laid out by the pool, actually on a lawn between the pool and beach access. We were able to have a bit of room around our lounge chairs, but we felt very lucky to find any in proximity of the pool. TIP: Get to the pool by 10:00. Be warned that while you can place personal articles on lounges to reserve them, the staff may remove the articles if the lounges do not look like they have been used for more than two hours. This is to be fair to other guests. As noted by others, the hotel tacks on an additional $17.77 per night resort fee for things that should be included anyway - local phone calls, the privilege of self-parking, and high-speed internet access (via a network cable in each room; it works well, by the way. I found one open WiFi access point but never got it to do anything interesting.). Valet parking is an additional $5 per day, first night free. If you are going to self park during your stay BE SURE TO TELL THE FRONT DESK or you will be charged the daily valet fee. We ate dinner in the Keka'a Terrace hotel restaurant one night, and we a bit taken back by the $78 tab for appetizers only, plus one $7 glass of wine, especially since we didn't think the quality was particularly good, definitely not good enough to justify the price. The dinner entrees are also quite pricey. We had lunch at the same restaurant on our last day and were VERY happy with the food and the price. TIP: Eat dinner elsewhere (unless you are going for the prime rib buffet, which we didn't try), but do try lunch, especially the Hawaiian Plate Lunch. My mouth is watering just writing about it. There are entertainers all around from mid morning until late evening. You will find a variety of activities including family-friendly outings and nighttime SCUBA dives right off the beach in front of the hotel. Snorkeling off Black Rock is FANTASTIC. TIP: Don't settle for looking at the fish where everyone else is floating, Swim out past the point where the crazy kids are cliff diving and go around to the right. You'll thank me. Note that it can get a little rough out there, so don't try it if the surf on the beach is high or if the waves seem somewhat violent on the shore. TIP: If you are not going to snorkel but want to swim in the ocean, move at least 100 yards down the beach from Black Rock to avoid some of the big rocks in the waist-deep water. The only real downside to this location is the loooong drive to get to activities on the rest of the island. Honolua Bay, 25 minutes. Kihei (great place to leave for SCUBA or snorkeling at Molokini) 45 minutes. Starting point of Hana Highway, 35-40 minutes. Kahului Airport 35-45 minutes. Haleakala, 1 hour 15 minutes with minimal traffic. Snorkeling from the beach in the areas south of Wailea, 60-90 minutes. Ok, enough of that. What you should expect: Clean, comfortable accomodations on beautiful, mostly quiet grounds at a price that can stretch some budgets but is easily justified. Rest and relaxation. Classic Sheraton service.

Calling the hotel direct I was given the impression that a deluxe ocean front room would be in building 6 on the black rock overlooking the ocean, but when we arrived we were given room in building 5 with two double beds with our balcony overlooking part of the building 6 parking lot with the ocean visible beyond. I called the front desk about our room and they indicated that the king size bed was just a request and that they would see what they could do. They were able to move us the following day to a room in building 6, with a king size bed. In our opinion the room in building 5 was not comparable to the buiild 6 room. In fact it looked like our room was meant to be a kids room that was next door to a larger room, where there was one door to access both rooms, and each room had also had its own key access. Once move to our new room we were satisfied, we we on the second floor and had a great view of the ocean and could hear the wave crash against the shore. We kept the balcony door open at night and the waves were almost too loud. Our room was nice and clean with a refrigerator and microwave. Note that it takes a little to get oriented at the Sheraton with its large property layout. From our room on the second floor of bldg 6, we had to go up one floor take a walkway about a 15 yards, take an elevator up to the 8th floor, and walk about 20 more yards to another elevator that we then took down to the first floor to get to the pool, beach, or breakfast across the lawn. We were in our room when the earthquake hit at about 7am, and everytining shaked quite a bit for a few seconds, but nothing fell off the wall or off a table. The hotel lost power immediately after the earthquake and didn't get it back unitl about 1:00pm. While power was out our electronic room keys still worked and the elevators worked. I thought the Sheraton handled the earthquake and power outage fairly well, as they we able to still serve breakfast. We had the breakfast buffet included in our hotel package and though it was well worth it (the normal charge was $25 per person). It included; the ability to have a custom made omelet, pancakes, waffles (some days), french toast (some days),scamble eggs, sausage, eggs benedict, pastries, fresh fruit, and more. In though the food was very good. We did not eat at any of the other hotel restaurants. We ate our first night at the Hula Grill, had a great view (which you pay for since almost all the entrees were over $30 and the food was only ok.). We also went to the Old Lahaina Luau, whose entertainment was great, but I thought the food was only OK. We ate at the I'O restuarant on 505 Front street in Lahaina which has a good ocean view from the outside patio, and the food was fantastic, but the bill for me and my wife was over a $100. We also ate at BJ's Chicago Pizza in Lahaina and had a great time; the food was good and reasonable, they had good entertainment; someone playing a guitar and singing mostly oldies with the rest of the music synthesized. I also was initially informed that half of the hotel pool was going to be renovated at the time of our stay, but was pleased to see that all work was completed. We though the pool was great., with its lagoon design connecting the adult pool area with the childrens area by a winding river passage. The Sheraton is on the widest part of a nice beach, but it is not the best swimming beach for kids, since the depth drops off pretty fast and the waves can be pretty big that break next to the shoreline.

I wrote a lengthy review of this hotel after our stay there but Expedia never posted it, so I'll try it here. First the good part. The Sheraton Maui is one of the best locations there is. The beach is awesome and the snorkling right in front of the hotel is better than almost anywhere on the island. We saw more fish and turtles there than we did on the snorkling trip we paid for. Its also great to be able to walk to whalers village for shopping and restaurants. Now the bad part. This hotel is over priced for the quality of the rooms and service you recieve. When we checked into the hotel I noticed the service was lacking. No one offerred to take us and our luggage to our room, we were merely given directions. When we got to the room, which was dated and worn, I went to the bathroom. While standing at the toilet I saw pubic hairs stuck to the wall. Not something you expect to see when your paying as much as we were. When we left the room I stopped by the front desk to tell them of this and the clerk was rude. I attempted to explain where the hairs were and she ignored me, simply calling housekeeping in the middle of our conversation. No surprise, when we returned to the room we found the hairs still there. Later in our stay we saw someone had left a dirty plate of food and their pool towel on a planter box by the stairs we used daily. We thought that was poor behavior by someone but were more shocked when it remained there for over two days. It wasn't like it was hidden. It was right there. How could housekeepers and groundspersons just leave it sit there for two days? Any quality hotel has managers that walk the grounds and would catch something like this. The attitude with the staff at this hotel appears to be they don't have to care because they have the best location. But when you are paying over $400 a night, you expect better. We recommend renting a condo nearby for half the price.", "Date": "October 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "WhiteZinfandel", "ReviewID": "UR5942803", "Content": "My husband and i checked in to the Sheraton Maui on the 6th September as part of our honeymoon.

Our stay at the Sheraton was was a little less luxurious then we expected. Our first night as honeymooners in Hawaii was spent is separate beds! We did not receive our proper room. 2 double beds sounds cozy for newly weds, sure, but not after a 12 hour flight and no sleep. So we started with a very nice view of the front gardens, but then we were moved to a lovely view of the rear parking lot and tennis courts to obtain the proper king size bed. (if you use a travel agent, they will use the guaranteed bedding excuse...) So, with that, DO NOT book a Mountain View room, its not an upgrade. The standard Garden Views are much better. Besides the rooms being very average, the food was also. Restaurants were just OK at best. All of the great places in Maui to dine, the 2 restaurants here do not even compare! That and hotel charges for everything.... I mean EVERYTHING. The coffee, newspapers, the safe in your room.... 18.00 per day, which is not included in the cost of your room?!?! I understand Hawaii is expensive, but that is why you stay at a Sheraton, correct? Hospitality? They charge you gratuity on top of your gratuities! Also, if you would like a nice glass of wine as an evening cocktail.... better do it before 7pm or bring your own. The bars and lounges outside close at 7?! Black Rock is very nice to have, but it draws large crowds to your \"home\" beach. With that, we found the Sheraton to be a nice hotel, but average resort. The grounds were very nice, pool was great, bartenders outside were awesome.... but the rooms, front desk service and overall value fell short. I know this contradicts most of the reviews posted, but we honestly were not impressed for the almost 400.00 per night honeymoon stay. Go down to the Hyatt!

I researched for 9 months prior to making my choice. After considering 20+ hotels across Maui I narrowed down to the Westin & the Sheraton (Both on Kaanapoli). I chose the Sheraton for the larger rooms, beach and better chance for a free room upgrade. We were not disappointed! The beach is large with the best snorkeling on the island. I saw turtles and hundreds of varieties of fish.... The Westin does have a super pool, but the beach in front of the Westin is too small - Also the Westin's rooms are small... Our room at the Sheraton was large the refrigerator was great - the Bathroom was plenty large. The room as well as the property in general was in excellent shape. The grounds were exspansive with grass trimmed much like golf course fairways. Take my word, you cannot get a better combination of beach, pool, ambience, and location than the Sheraton (especially if you are a \"beach \" person. If you are stricktly a pool person and do not mind smaller rooms, the Westin is very very nice - Newer building nicely appointed but grounds are a little constrained - The grounds are very ornate! and on a whole, nicer and newer than the Sheraton. The Westin is right next to Whalers Villiage an up-scale shopping and moderately priced dining destination (The Sheraton is a 5 minute walk away) I was very impressed with the shops and the prices for food at the 3-4 restaurants was not out of line.... I wish I knew how some folks get better rates at the Sheraton than $250 per night - I spent 6 months shopping rates - I do know that some conference rates are lower but there is little chance for a room upgrade... I think I might have paid $20 to $30 more a night but the room upgrade was awesome and not as probable at the lower rates - I talked to several folks who did not get an upgrade - I think my agent and broker helped to get the upgrade. Our room overlooked the grounds and the beach - buildings 3 and 4 are the absolute best locations - the even number rooms face the water. We visited the Grand Wailea in Wailea - It was a magnificent place, probably 3 times more rooms than the Sheraton...(many more people put in about the same size property) But Wailea is isolated and there is very limited dining and good shoping on that part of the island.... Kapalua is even more of a micro destination with nice accomodations but limited beach and dining etc..... Kaanipali is the absolute best destination on Maui with Lahaina only a 5 minute drive Great shopping food and nightlife!

We ate at the hotel Prime Rib buffet and were pleaantly suprised at the price and quality. We got there kind of late so they were running low on somethings, but we were completely happy. The hotel grounds and location is what makes it key. The design is awesome and it is lovely maintained. I loved seeing the geckos or lizards running around the outside of the buildings at night. They were oh so cute. Check in the lights on the outside of the buildings and you will be bond to see them, they must like the heat of the lights. The hotel's pool is awesome and so relaxing. They were working on part of it and there was still plenty of space. Never did we feel crowded there at all. There were a lot of fellow honeymooners at our hotel. The beach and snorkeling around black rock lives up to what they say. I saw 2 octupus, 1 sea turtle and plenty of fish. I would say not as clear as Molikini, but well worth the cost = free. Molokini is cool, but not enough activity other than fish and it cost $94 or so. Local offshore snorkeling is comparable for free. I booked the most basic room and we were given a king room with garden viewand of the tennis courts. Hotel was sold out, and they were remodeling one whole building so upgrade options were hard to come bye for free. We asked on day 3 of 7 and they had a 2 double bed room with deluxe ocean view which we took and loved despite the 2 sep. beds. We made it worked and loved the sunsets nightly.

One suggestion is to stop at Long's Drug Store on the way (near the Lahaina Cannery Mall) and buy snorkeling gear/food/etc. there. It's much cheaper to buy it than the 20+ dollar per day rental - then you can use it all week! Long's was a lifesaver - we bought snacks, drinks, and coffee there - room service is expensive and so are the restaurants. Save your money for dinner.

The price is expensive, until you remember that you are staying at the hotel that is at one of the most popular attractions, Black Rock and it's beach. You are a five minute walk to Whaler's village, and a 10 minute drive from Lahaina. We got a junior suite in building 2 on the 4th floor. The view was amazing. Our large balcony looked across the lawn area to the beach and a full ocean view. Each night we watched the sunset from our Lanai, it was beautiful. The view stretched from the lawn area on the left, across the pool area on the right, and we could see Black Rock and the whold Sheraton beach. The restaurants were clean and average price for Maui hotels. The buffet breakfast was good as usual. The room service was a bit pricey, even by room service standards, but the service was quick at least. Housekeeping staff were very pleasant and had the room cleaned within an hour of when we left, no matter what time we left it... it was amazingly timed. We rented a car and had to park int he parking garage, which was a little bit of a walk, but not too bad. The pool area was great, water was clean, plenty of chaise lounge chairs, but not much shade. If you want to be pool side, but be in the shade, you better go down early to stake out your spot. One day we rented umberella and chairs on the beach, which worked out very well for $15.00. Especially since you could move the shade as the sun moved, very nice. I also did a basic scuba lesson one day, which was fabulous. It started in the pool for about 45 minutes... then went to a beach dive for another 45 minutes. The instructor was very nice and reassuring.

Let me first say that Maui is awesome. So much better than Oahu. If I went back, I would try to fly into Kapulua airport rather than Kuhuiui. The main reason is proximity and getting from airport to hotel. From Kuhuiui it is a beautiful drive on a two lane road, but bumper to bumper making the 25 mile drive take well over an hour. Kapulua airport would have been 5 minutes! Not sure on the price difference though. Room location was #4313 right against Black Rock and on the beach, beautiful views and accessibility. Room was small and very much outdated. Really needs remodeling. Due to its aging, it did not appear very clean. Really not what I expected for $420/night. Most of the hotel for that matter was in dire need of renovations. If I rated Maui alone, it would be a 5 of 5. The Sheraton however is a solid 3. Breakfast buffet was free (promotional deal when booking), but not very good. Same crappy food everyday. Service was not very desirable. In addition, the birds flying in and attacking your plates and table when you got up to get something was very displeasing. It was almost Hitchcock like. Pool and beach were amazing, yet crowded. Snorkeling was awesome right off shore, but as with anything in Hawaii, get there early to get a spot. Restaurants we ate at were as follows: Plantation House (Kapaula golf course) enjoyable 15 min drive north. - Best food during stay bar none! Scenery/food/service was second to none. Hula Grille (whalers village Kaanapoli) dinning room area, not barefoot bar: Excellent dinner and service. Very much recommended. You will end up buying a bottle of the Hawaiian vinegar for bread dipping to go! Rusty Harpoon (whalers village Kaanapoli) Meals were okay, but nothing to brag about. Service was good. Ruths Chris (Lahina) I've never been disappointed about Ruths before, but this time I really was. Very overpriced and steaks were lousy. Not what I expected from such a prestigious chain. Longhis (Lahina) This was very advertised, but food and service was far from good. We should have known since at 7pm there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.

The bellman that took us over to our room (in a golf cart) was very friendly and ansewered a lot of our questions about the property. The concierge was great at getting us last minute dinner reservations and she had a great deal of infomation and knowledge to share. Our maid service was excellent and never intrusive. We only ate breakfast and lunch at the hotel but the buffett was wonderful with several stations and a huge selection of food for even the pickest eater. We stayed in building 6 which is a bit of a hike to the pool and beach area (you have to ride 3 elevators to get there) but the location is so spectacular that you don't mind. The sun sets everynight on your lanai. We walked down to check out the other hotels that we considered, the Westin and the Hyatt. While they had very impressive swimming pools, the beach area in front of each was much smaller and they Hyatt actually was quite narrow with a few rocks scattered about and not much room to actually lay on the beach (you would have to lay poolside which looked amazing too - not a bad choice at all). They are all walking distance to each other, so walking down to the beach in front of the Sheraton would not be a problem, but if you want to actually lay in front of your hotel on the beach then this is the best place. The beach in front of the Sheraton is wide with plenty of room for everyone. Even though the hotel was full it never felt crowded. The other hotel grounds looked like they were packed. We only had trouble securing chairs and an umbrella on the one day when we arrived at the beach after noon. We found out that if you can get a cabana ahead of time by reservation of if you stop by in the morning, you can secure your chairs and umbrella for the entire day. The will set it up and put a name tag on it which secures it until 5:00. The swimming pools were lovely, but not the waterpark the other two offer. They were much calmer with a \"lazy river\" winding under bridges and connecting several smaller pools. This would be a great place for couples or honeymooners because the other pools are very Disney like. The pools and the grounds are very relaxing and tropical with a lot of character and great plant life to make you feel like you are at an isolated resort. The other hotels are quite beautiful but they have the feeling that they are in the middle of a strip of hotels on the beach walk. If you want the beach then the Sheraton is it. If your more of a pool person and don't care about the beach then try the others. There really are no bad choices among these three on Kaanapali. The snorkeling location on Black Rock is the best and being so close to Whaler's village is great too.

Even if we were in another building, come on people, a little walk never hurt...the spreadout nature of the Sheraton is what makes it great.

Naturally the suite was very roomy but we've always found that the rooms here are very comfortable with plenty of room on the patio for at least two chairs. The snorkeling at Black Rock is great if the weather is clear. If there has been a lot of rain you get sufficient run off that the water clarity suffers. In the summer GO EARLY! The beach is packed by 10:00 am. That said, if you swim around the right side of the point you will almost always find that there are no crowds. The current can be stronger here but if you're a good swimmer you'll always be rewarded with lots of fish and the occasional sea turtle.

We arrived at the Sheraton on Tuesday, June 13th around 2PM. Upon pulling up to the valet we were greeted with gorgeous orchid leis and my son was even given a boogie board that had been left behind by another family (nice touch)! We then were told we would not be able to check in at the curb but would have to go to the front desk. My husband is a platinum Starwood rewards member so he had put in a request for an upgrade. We didn't really want building 6 as so many people rave about because we have a 5 year old son who wants to get to the pool/beach ASAP when he gets up in the morning. The girl at the front desk, kindly told us that we would be upgraded to an ocean view junior suite but it wouldn't be ready until 4 BUT she was going to contact housekeeping and put a \"rush\" on our room. They gave us 2 free drink coupons to have drinks by the pool. I changed my little one into his swim suit and away we went to the pool. At around 3:30 we decided to just \"check\" to see if our room was ready - it wasn't and we received a little bit of attitude from the front desk agent. We were only checking because she said that she would \"put a rush\" on things......anyway, we were checked into our room a little after 4. The room was terrific! We were in building 3 and faced the pool/ocean/grounds and we were right off the elevatore. I was a little worried about that but we didn't hear a thing! The upgrade was WONDERFUL living room with wet bar, seperate bedroom with king bed and huge bathroom (tub and toilet seperate). BUT where was our little one to sleep???? We were told that we would have to pay $65 for a roll away a day....when we made the reservations we were very clear about needing a room that accomodated 3 people. We were willing to change rooms we told the front desk but were told there were no rooms to change us to.....I think there may have been more than one convention going on.....after a short discussion with the front desk manager we received a roll away for no charge. After the whole checking in and bed ordeal things were smooth sailing! The room was always cleaned and ready for us by 2 (one day I went up to get something around 11:30 and the room was done!). They supplied us with plenty of towels and always replenished the toiletries which were Aveda and great! We had a mini fridge and a microwave so we went to Safeway and picked up breakfast items and snacks. It was hugely convenient especially with a child. We ate lunch a few days by the pool and the food was very good. The child's menu couldn't be beat except I didn't know why a burger and chips was $7 but so was a PB&J!!! I thought that was a little ridiculous. The drinks by the bar were \"ok\". At $8.25 a drink they should have been better.....We ended up buying wine and rum and a few mixers to keep in our room. Much cheaper! The one drink I did like very much was the \"Hula Punch\". We didn't eat dinners on property at all because there are so many fantastic restaurants on Maui we wanted to get to as many as we could. A couple to remember: (1) Roy's Kahana was very good - EXCELLENT service! Everyone there was so accomodating and helpful. A fly flew into my glass of wine so the server immediately removed the glass and offered me the wine menu so that I could order another glass on the house. Nice touch! (2) Plantation House Kapalua - always excellent food and awesome views but we do have a gripe about the hostess & manager. Our reservations were for 6:30. We arrived at 6:15 and there were MANY tables empty but were told we would have to wait. At 6:30 when my husband checked to see if our table was ready (we were all famished) he got reprimanded that \"you were early\". Now most places are happy if you arrive early especially if there are a lot of tables open. Once seated it took our server a good 10 minutes to even greet us (once she did she was great). But as we ate our meal we watched the manager go from table to table greeting the patrons - as a matter of fact he went to every table around us but ours! How strange! I thought both the hostess and the manager acted in poor taste. (3) Pacific'O's - great food, great service (we were 20 min. early and seated without a problem!). ask for a table on the beach (but wear your Off! - mosquitos!). We did take advantage of the Kid's Club for our son. We did the 1/2 day morning program which included lunch for him and we used the service for 2 evenings so we could have dinner. Our son LOVED the program there. He received a backpack & canteen on his first visit which he thought was so \"cool\" and then for their night program they got a disposable camera and went on a \"hike\" around the property and were encouraged to take pictures of Hawaii animals and flowers. Very nice touch. One thing I noticed one day was that there were a group of people from the Westin using our pool (you get wrist bands by the pool every day to identify you as a guest). I knew that Starwood had done away with the \"stay at 1 use all 3\" policy so I asked the pool attendant and was told that Westin guests can use the Sheraton property but Sheraton guests can not use the Westin property! What is that all about??? When making reservations the Westin and the Sheraton were exactly the same price (the sheraton even a little more expensive) so why should the Westin have priority over the Sheraton guests. We just wanted to check out the pool with our son one day. The pool attendent said she didn't agree with the policy either and that more people should contact Starwood to discuss this issue. I might.....I don't know how important it is to me...... The beach at the Sheraton is terrific but when snorkeling at Black Rock you need a traffic cop to patrol. My husband got kicked in the head once and I got kicked in the stomach. Even first thing in the morning the water is very packed with people. Black Rock is a great snorkeling spot (there are other great spots on the island too though - Honolua Bay, Cliff House, Makena beach, and Polo Beach to name a few). The beach is very crowded though with both guests and non guests so many times we got discouraged. So one day out of curiosity we wondered what was on the \"other side\" of Black Rock. What a treasure we found there!!!! A beautiful wide soft sand beach that was virtually EMPTY!!! THe water was Caribbean blue and calm (even in the afternoon trade winds) and the snorkeling on that side of Black Rock was just as great (without all the people). Both times we snorkeled there we were the ONLY ones in the water! We did a snorkel sail which we booked right there at the Sheraton on the Teralani 2. It was very nice and considering the boat can hold 49 people there were only 12 on it that day. It was like a private charter! The water was choppy that day so on the way out both my husband and I were a little green. I even had a hard time eating lunch! We've stayed at the Marriott Kaanapali and the Renaissance Wailea so we had something to compare the Sheraton to. The Sheraton is a very nice, clean hotel. It is on the quiet side with not a lot of kids but if you want it noisy and with a lot of kids stay at the Westin or Hyatt. Overall, we were very pleased with our stay there. We try to stay in only 4 or 5 star hotels and it's definitely not a 5 star but it is a good solid 4 star!

We received a fairly good room rate by calling Starwood (we are SPG) and getting an ocean view. When we arrived, we were upgraded to a Junior Suite. Our suite was nice, but it was ground level in Bldg 4. Though I liked it, I do wish it were a floor or two higher so we had better ocean views. Nonetheless, our patio was very private and the room quite large with a separate eating area and kitchen. Not bad for about $238/night. This hotel, in my opinion, is the best on Ka'anapali. The Sheraton by far commands the best section of real estate along this very busy beach. The grounds are large, well-manicured and very spread out. The views looking back towards the middle of the island are phenomenal. The rooms are just okay, but the bed is very comfortable. I liked the pool - though we really didn't use it much. No need with Ka'anapali beach right there. My biggest disappointment was the cost to rent chair and/or cabanas. $30 a day? Get real. That's why I went to a hotel ON THE BEACH - to lay on the beach in a nice chaise lounge, and you're going to charge me extra to do so? The Sheraton is great for couples - I saw far less children at this hotel than I did at the Westin, Hyatt, etc. Nonetheless, it still seemed good for families. We are from the East Coast of the US and awoke very early each morning. Therefore, we got to enjoy the beach while it was still quiet. The beach gets quite crowded by 11:00 am, especially on weekends when the locals are out enjoying the ocean in addition to the tourists. If you do get beach chairs, I strongly suggest getting them as far from Black Rock as possible on the Sheraton property. It is much less crowded the further one gets away from this area. Black Rock has good snorkeling (and very easy), but I highly advise getting there before 9:30 to get the calmest sea conditions and to avoid the crowds. Black Rock gets very crowded later in the morning and it continues all day. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Sheraton. My only complaints are the cost of beach chairs and the so-so rooms. I don't give this property a five-star rating for these reasons, and because we moved south to Wailea for the remainder of our stay and stayed at a standout property down there.", "Date": "June 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orange County, CA", "Title": "\u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the not so ugly\u201d", "Author": "familyintheoc", "ReviewID": "UR5332361", "Content": "My husband and I, and our 2 children (5 and 8), stayed at the Sheraton May 29th - June 4th. We booked the mailed invitation deal of $775 with $100 in g/c and $185 off an Avis rental car. We booked an additional night through their website, for a total of 6 nights, 7 days. We have traveled to the Big Island and Oahu several times, but this was our first trip to Maui. We never stay in less than a 4 star hotel and we love to travel, though we mostly stay on the mainland. I called the Sheraton ahead to make sure we would not have to take a timeshare tour and I was assured we didn't. We were contacted by a Starwood vacations rep and conversed with her via email several times before our trip. Keeping all that in mind, upon our arrival we were given a lei greeting at the valet and were whisked off to our room. I've read many talk about an upgrade, and the Starwood rep knew it was our 10th anniv., however we were put in their basic very tiny room overlooking the tennis courts. Literally, there was no room for a family of 4's suitcases, I had to move some furniture outside it was so small. After going to the pool that afternoon, we came back to the room to shower and the tub and floor and walls were covered in black mold. There was no fan in the bathroom so it was a breeding ground. We have asthma, so I called the front desk and they sent someone up to show me another room. The new offered room was the same size with a view of the pool and beach. Not worth the entire re-packing, so they offered to clean it up with bleach in the morning. The next morning we decided we would try to move, since the bleach may make asthma worse, and the front desk decided to show us another room, which was a little bigger and had a better view. That room # was 2411. We packed up and actually had way more room for suitcases in the new digs. After getting a message from the Starwood rep. we went to get our g/c and she sneakily tried to book us on a timeshare tour and no wasn't an option. Not wanting to cause a major scene, we left and later left her a note that we were not interested. Just our food charges were over $1500.00, not including alot of misc. and lobby store shopping, so they did not lose any money on us! Starwood could have been honest about the offer instead of telling us they just wanted us to try the Sheraton out! On a better note, the grounds were lovely, very tropical and we loved the cliff diver and firedancer. A few times the cliff diver would let our kids help light the tiki torches, he was so nice. The pool was great, never very busy and a great temp. We rented a beach cabana one day and it was fun, and the snorkeling was great, though not as much coral as expected. We loved the Kekaa's terrace restaurant, the staff were fabulous and gave us special treatment as the week progressed. My husband had a great lobster and steak dinner one evening, and their is live music and a hula dancer each night. The salad bar free with your meal was a treat and our kids always ate free. Room service was fine, though we were bummed it had limited hours. If you are hungry at an off time the pool bar is the only place to get a bite and it was mediocre at best. We needed a microwave in our room for the week and it was $100.00....should have just bought a cheap one at walmart and left it, lol. Maid service was good, and everyone around the resort were very nice. We checked out all the hotels around the area and we believe the Sheraton was the nicest. It never felt crowded and the location was absolutely ideal. Valet would have our car waiting if we called ahead. We didn't use the concierge but we did take a ride on the Reefdancer and it was really neat. We tried to talk the kids into a helicopter ride or a submarine ride but they would only compromise on that! We had lunch one day at The Four Seasons in Wailea, we are big fans of the 4 Seasons, and it was nice (though expensive- $160 for 4), but we weren't that impressed with the style of the hotel, it didn't seem Hawaiian, just modern. Waliea beach was ok, but the beach in front of the Sheraton and the Black rock was stunning and wayyyyy better. We walked to the Grand Wailea and we weren't impressed neither, their grounds were far less manicured and tropical, an the pool didn't look as great as it did online. We also ventured to Kapalua one day and the Ritz wasn't anything to write home about neither, the weather was awful there and windy, and the beach is very far from the resort. Overall, the Sheraton is truly the best place to stay on Maui in our opinions, and even with the Starwood issues and the black mold prob in the beginning, we would certainly return. We'd just be smarter next time and book a nicer room ahead of time! With all the stuff to do on Maui, it is perfect for anyone. One last note, do not visit Twin Falls on the road to Hana, the trail gets ridiculous and it is way longer than the tourist books say....kids can't make it! And don't fly Aloha airlines, we tried them for the first time and we will never fly them again. Their food wasn't good enough to feed to a dog, the service was bad, and it is basically a daycare in the air with parents who don't watch their kids letting babies and toddlers run the aisles.

A beautiful view of the ocean with the islands of Molokai and Lanai in the distance, soft sheets and down blanket, big bathroom with 2 sinks. Quiet room, no babies crying, no cell phones ringing, we even saw a rainbow while opening our front door. There was a private parking lot by the room, at no extra cost. However, it is a HUGE resort. One in a strip of other major chains and condos. Lots of people by the HUGE pool, which winds around in a big loop. The kids all stayed at the shallow end of the pool, and the families sat on those lounge chairs. There were really no kids at the deeper end of the pool, where the adults quietly sat and soaked in the sun (no music playing until much later in the afternoon, which was pleasant). The beach, which is right in front of the hotel, gets very crowded (the beach is public and gets people from all over for snorkeling). The hotel is at the famous \"Black Rock\" where everyone on the west side of Maui comes to snorkel- so snorkel early or risk fins in your face. Whaler's Village, which is a 10 minute walk away on a path along the beach, is not more than an upscale mall including the teenage mall rats. We liked eating at Leilani's and Hula Grill at the entrance of Whaler's Village. Tropica (at the Westin, just past Whaler's V) was overpriced and the service was awful. Aloha plate was an inexpensive and casual lunch spot in Lahaina, a 10 minute drive from the hotel, with decent food. Everything is extra at the hotel. On the beach, prepare to pay $15 for 2 beach chairs, and $15 for an umbrella (there is no shade otherwise- not even at the pool). Bottled water in the room was $5 (even though it was free at the Sheraton Kauai). Got ripped off with a $45 manicure. However, service was excellent and very friendly. Rent your snorkel gear in Lahaina for a fraction of the price that the hotel will charge you. Make all your plans and reservations before or immediately on arrival because things book up quickly. Follow the advice in Maui Revealed. We went to a luau in Lahaina called the Feast at Lele- which was intimate, entertaining and had great food! (The Old Lahaina Luau- which is supposed to be \"the\" luau books up months in advance). We took a van to sunrise at Haleakala rather than drive it ourselves- which was a great idea. We watched the sunrise and were then driven up even further to the summit. Arranged it through the hotel and it included a delicious sit-down breakfast at the Kula Lodge.

We booked the Spring Fling Rate of $195 per night plus 2 nights free using points. Our room was located in Bldg 4 right next to Blackrock which was exactly what I wanted as well as the request for a high floor which was also part of my reservation notes. We had the same room all 7 nights. We received a room with 2 balconies, one which faced the beach that all the rooms in bldg 4 have but, we also had a second balcony that was HUGE. Big enough for a party of 20 people. The views from the 2nd balcony were amazing of the West Maui Mountains, beach all the way to Kahana and the beach in front of the Sheraton. The bed was comfy, however the wood furniture needs refurnishing. I almost went out and bought some Liquid Gold to cover the scratches. It would be a real easy fix and then no one would really notice all the missing paint and scratches. The room was small. The closet is in the Bathroom. The dry wall in the bathroom needed some repair. Again, an easy fit if it was your home... if you know what I mean. So beyond all the repairs, the double balcony made up for all of it. Just Amazing! We did not really spend much time in the room .... just on the balconies...so we could over look the much needed repairs. Coffee every morning on the big balcony watching the sun rise over the West Maui Mountains. Very Relaxing. Every day/ night started around 4pm there was live Hawaiian music which flowed up to our room. We were surprised with a ok bottle of Champagne for our 20th Anniversary and enjoyed sitting on the balcony with the warm trade winds and music. We had 2 dinners at Keka'a Terrace, both very good. Fish was excellent plus they have a salad bar. The music continues from the ocean bar after the cliff diving and fire torches to the outside portion of Keka'a Terrace restaurant. We ate there on our last night with hula, music and the trade winds blowing. Very Romantic. Overall, I would agree with most that the location is the best. Fun to walk to Whalers for sunset but, get there by 5:45 for a seat at any bar for 7pm sunset. Snorkeling was excellent great red coral plus lots of fish. The Maui Aquarium was fun. Mama's fish house was great and even the salads a Cheeseburger in paradise were good. Our favorite 2 restaurants were Mala Ocean Tavern in North Lahaina (good parking) and Mama's fish house. We did eat at Aloha Mixed Plate, but just next door is Mala and the views are 100% better. I eat at L&L all the time at home and the ribs at Aloha were very good if not better.

One drawback was the beach was very crowded since black rock is right there and that's a prime snorkeling spot. Didn't have any problems getting a chair at the pool. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants at the hotel. We chose to try the numerous places that our friends suggested. And they were all great. Breakfast, try Gazebo in Napili and The Plantation house in Kapalua. Fast food take out, Honokowai Okazuya & Deli. Try the ono (wahoo) there. Outstanding. Sushi, definitely hit up Sansei in Kapalua. Back to the hotel (pardon the pun), overall it was great, especially for the price.

We got the room for $195 a night through bookit, but add to that a 17.71 daily \"resort fee\" for parking, coffee in the room, newspaper, and the fee isn't optional. The first day of valet is complimentary, then 5 bucks a day thereafter, plus tip, but you are already paying for parking in the resort fee. There are lots of spaces in the parking garage, and it's very close to the lobby so you aren't saving yourself a lot of time by using valet. Remember to tell the front desk you wont be using valet parking after the first day. Your room key gets you into the parking garage. The room was clean, the bed had nice linens, the bathroom had adequate towels, soap, lotions, shampoo, conditioner. There is a small fridge, and it costs extra to have a microwave in the room. There is a lot of closet/dresser space. There is a laundry facility in building 4, WAY across the complex. It's 2 bucks for the washer, 2 for the dryer, and 1 for the detergent. If you do more than one load, or have family sized laundy, you would do better going into town, or at least buying a box of detergent at Longs. The service was pleasant. I had emailed asking for a king size bed and we were not given one; I asked reception to change it and it took about 10 minutes but it was changed. The travel agent in the lobby is very nice, but you will get better deals if you look around, but it is convenient for them to do all the planning for you and print out your tickets. The food by the pool was average; we had nachos that quickly turned soggy. The breakfast buffet was expensive; 23 bucks for each adult, but we liked the variety and the food. A BETTER breakfast bet is driving north to Napali Shores (you'll see an itty bitty sign on the condo sign for \"The Gazebo\"), park, walk through the complex down to the water, and you'll get to The Gazebo restaurant. Their Big Kahuna omelet and Macadamia Pancakes fed two adults for under 25 bucks, and we couldn't eat it all. Get there by 7:15 am to avoid lines; otherwise you'll wait 30 to 45 minutes in line to be seated. The snorkeling at Black Rock is okay but crowded and you have to watch out for people jumping off the rock onto your head. You'll do better going to Makena Landing or 2.1 miles north past Office Road to the reserve. The beach at the Sheraton is lovely and perfect for families. The pool is beautiful; we got out there early and were the only people in it. We really enjoyed it. I would stay here again, but only if I got a deal. I wouldn't spend $400 a night, because I didn't think it was worth that, but I would spend $200 a night, due to the nice facility, convenient location, great pool and beach, decent snorkeling, and atmosphere.", "Date": "May 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maplewood, NJ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Deal at the Sheraton\u201d", "Author": "MsMaplewood", "ReviewID": "UR5048144", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton Maui 4/19-4/26.

My only recommendation when staying here would be to avoid eating at the Sheraton restaurants. We tried the breakfast buffet one morning and the food and service were both horrible.

My wife & I stayed here in March 2006 and loved it. The grounds are soo beautiful. I've traveled a fair amount (domestically & internationally) and this is one of the top five most beautiful hotels that I've ever stayed at. I love the open air lobby; it has such a tropical, laid back feel. It was pretty early when we arrived in Maui and I wouldn't normally ask to see if we could check in so early, but my wife just said, let's give it shot. I was surprised to hear we were able to check in. All staff were very friendly our whole stay there. We got a mountainview room, and thought we lucked out because not only did we have a picturesque view of the mountains, but we actually had a slight view of the ocean too. It wasn't the beach right in front of the hotel, but just north of it. Since we were facing east, we saw the sunrise one morning from behind the mountains and it was beautiful! The room was very very nice; nothing spectacular, but definitely very nice. The parking garage was a hassle to get to and you could definitely get lost, so I would ask an employee for directions or just use valet. The pool was nice. The employees were pretty knowledgeable about the ocean. We didn't get to go snorkel at Black Rock, which was very disappointing; there was high surf on the last & only day we had time to go. The beach in front of the hotel is pretty narrow (from the edge of the water to the back end of the sand). It was always very crowded, so we actually walked down to the beach near Whaler's Village (a short walk); there was way more room to spread out there. We also ate a couple times at Whaler's Village, but we found ourselves driving to Lahaina alot because there were so many more dining options. For the runners out there, there wasn't really a great place to go running. The beach was fairly angled (not to mention crowded) and the path in front of the beach was full of people (but not angled). So, we ended up running on the roads (not crowded or angled), but there's only so much road before you get on the main highway, if you will, and we didn't really want to venture out on that road.

I was at the Sheraton-Maui from 3/24 thru 3/30 and I can honestly say that it was one of the most fantastic resorts I've been to and in the past six weeks I've traveled the globe staying in great places. You've all read about the location and it is fantastic. Its easy to get to from the airport. You will need a rental car as its more than $60 for a taxi ride from the airport each way and that will pay for a sub-compact for the week. In any case we arrived to the free valet parking (first day) and a lei greeting and check in was less than a minute with a complimentary upgrade from the garden room we booked to a full ocean view. Note that I did not even ask-they already had the upgrade before I even said I had an SPG card. At no time were we asked to do a timeshare presentation. The hotel is trying out a new way of speeding up the check-in and arrival process and from my point of view it worked great and was super smooth and the staff was extremely pleasant. We did eat at the hotel restaurant Keka's Terrace and the Mahi-Mahi was fantastic after a long day of traveling. We were in building 3 on the top floor(6) with a view thru the palm trees of the ocean and a bit of the pool. The grounds were magnificent and very well maintained so I have no idea what the previous reviewer is talking about. Never was anything out of place even as Maui went thru 40 straight days of heavy rain and flooding. The sun never did come out fully so we were able to get chairs by the pool or spots on the beach. Always had no problems with service outside.The hot-tub is well hidden and many people miss it altogether. Pool was a little cool as there was no sun that week. This is a large property so depending on which building you were in it could take 10 minutes to get to the parking garage, but most people go to Hawaii to relax-whats your hurry? why complain. You go to Maui for some seclusion-yes it can be crowded at times, but it is a resort with what 600 rooms? on the whole the pace of Maui is perfect-very relaxed. The location of the Sheraton is great just at the end of the row of resorts and walking distance to Whalers Village shopping center. I went up to the Ritz-Carlton and down to Wailea to see the Four Seasons and frankly thought the Sheraton was their equal. The service was superior. Our TV remote stopped working and then the TV altogether and within 5 minutes of informing the front desk there was a maintenance man there to repair it (the cord had pulled out of the tv and it was covered by a plate to keep the guests out) so my wife could watch LOST. We were also entertained by the whales breaching. We saw them from the room as well as the beach. There were a few sea turtles around Black Rock too, but alot of snorkelers kind of sent them swimming away. EVERYBODY walks down to snorkel Black Rock! Surf was rough, although not nearly as rough as down the beach towards the Westin and others where there were some big waves. Although the weather was bad due to a low pressure system affecting all the islands we had a great relaxing time. There was not one thing that was bad so again I think the previous reviewer had an axe to grind. Its not cheap, but nothing on Maui is. Despite a funnel cloud on Maui and a tornado on Lanai along with severe flooding the trip was great. Dinner on our last night was at Teppan-Yaki DAN in the hotel and it was great with a great show-make sure you get reservations and note they are closed Sun/Mon.

A rental car was included in our deal; we arrived at the Sheraton to be greeted by friendly people with leis, our room was upgraded (bldg. 6, first floor, opening out to a lovely lawn and a sweeping ocean view)and our room was big, clean, and had very comfortable beds. A plus for us animal lovers was that a couple of feral cats were being fed outside our room (we left some $ for the nice employees who did this) and we enjoyed watching them eat and play. They were upgrading the pool \"slide\" and we wondered how that would be given construction noise, etc. Not a problem. I suppose if we'd had kids along, it might have mattered -- and the reciprocity with the Westin next door had been revoked, which, again, might have been a problem with a family group, but we were content to stay where we were.

(Took along \"Maui for Dummies\" which has excellent recommendations for food.) Had fabulous sushi at a place in Kanapali (spelling). Despite the fact that the place was huge, we never had that \"big hotel\" feeling, and fortunately our building had been renovated so the rather dilapidated carpet in some of the halls wasn't still in ours. We did do the \"presentation\" for a timeshare, only because we wanted to go horseback riding and the payback for attending covered that cost. We told the people before even signing up that we would not, repeat not, ever sign up for a timeshare, so we didn't feel as though we were cheating them.

I stayed here March 1-4, 2006, just a quick side trip from the Big Island. The Sheraton Maui is an ideal hotel in about the most perfect setting on Kaanapali Beach. Close to shops, restaurants and Lahaina. The snorkeling off Black Rock is truly some of the best and you are guaranteed to see sea turtles and eagle rays on occaission, too. This was my first time actually staying at the Sheraton Maui. All other times on Maui we would spend a day or two on the beach in front of the hotel enjoying the snorkeling, sun and sand. While the hotel underwent complete rennovation about 5 years ago, it still looks great-I was on Maui in December 2005 and visited this property and they were doing typical low season house cleaning back then and it showed on this trip. The only negative thing I will say is that the pool's chemicals are awful...it smells like windshield wiper fluid so I did not spend any time in the pool, but, why would you when you have the ocean twenty steps in front of you? I will most likely not stay here again only because I have other favorites on the island that are much more secluded and more Hawaiian. However, I highly reccommend it for families and honeymooners. Keep in mind during winter months, the beach in front of the hotel almost disappears but returns in the summer for perfect beach walking! Lastly, restaurants--Mala in Lahaina & Mama's in Paia are not to be missed! Also, for the Buffalo NY's review before mine...all beaches in Hawaii are public...which is why Hawaii is so special...no one is excluded from the beauty of nature...if you want private, head to the Carribean or Mexico!

We went for 6 nights and didn't have time to do what all we wanted to do and see. We didn't get to do the Volcano tour, but I heard it's a must even though you have to get up at the crack of dawn to go.. The drive thru Hana is so worth it.. Seeing all of the Island and all of the lush area of the Island. The hotel itself was nice.. A bit older from what I would consider a 4 star hotel, but it was still nice. I loved being able to swim right off the beach and snorkel.. They have a big black rock right by the hotel that has tons of fish swimming all around it, so great for snorkeling. Be aware of the bugs.. I'm not sure if this is a problem at other hotels, but we saw three roaches in our room.. I had read reviews before and new this might be a problem so we didn't say anything until our last days on the trip.. The hotel was really nice and offerd to change our rooms, but we had one more day and somehow I didn't think changing rooms would help the bug problem.. they did however offer a dinning gift card which was nice. Just be aware of the bugs and leaving your slidding door open isn't a good idea because of bugs possibly getting in. The food was really good at pretty much everywhere we went. I would recommend the Macademia Nut Waffles for breakfast over at the Grand Waliea Hotel. The Grand Waliea is a VERY NICE Hotel, I've also stayed there twice in previous trips to Maui, but it's extremely expensive for a beach front room in the 500's. I would recommend checking out that area, maybe get up and go have breakfast in there grand eating area. and then check out the beach and then later drive over to Mama's Fish House for lunch.. It's been known to see alot of surfers there.. We went for dinner, so no surfers when we went. Mama's Fish House is pricey, so I wouldn't recommend it, if on a budget but it's nice and well known.. I would recommend getting a rental care, because there's so many places to go and see.", "Date": "March 9, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Views/Location & Wonderful Service!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4594636", "Content": "My sister and I stayed at this hotel two vacations ago and I can't stop thinking about what a wonderful time we had and our hotel had a lot to do with it!

We stayed in Waikiki at the Halekulani for $350 in 2004 for our honeymoon and we had better poolside service. The room was quite small for the money (again, compared to the Halekulani). The location is nice with Black Rock snorkeling which was very good. We did have a huge cockroach in our room the next to last night we were there.

The hotel was wonderful, and we had a great time. We were upgraded from a mountain view to a partial-ocean view room upon arrival. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure what was partial about the ocean view, as it had an incredible view of the North side of Kaanapali. Not sure if we just lucked out, or if they did it for our anniversary, or if giving them our Starwoord Preferred Guest number in advance helped. The hotel rooms are of typical size. We did not have any of the room problems mentioned in earlier reviews. We stayed on the top (6th) floor of our building (#3), which made our view better, but I noticed that the size of the lanais get smaller on the higher floors. Our lanai was only a few feet deep, with room only for one chair and side table. If you want a bigger lanai, you may want to get a lower floor level. Here are some more tips based on our experience: Pool/beach lounging: When we first got there, it was during the peak season, and the hotel was full. As a result, the lounge chairs for the pool were all claimed by people leaving towels, books, and the like on them very early in the morning. There was also a long line to rent beach lounge chairs as soon as the rental desk opened at 8 am. Fortunately, I had called a week before we arrived and reserved a beach cabana for the days we planned to be on the beach, at $35 per day. Even though we noticed that other hotels don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t charge quite so much for their cabana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, we thought this was money well spent. We never had to worry about getting in line early in the morning, and the cabanas have a sun shade that you can put up or down as you like. I did notice that after January 2nd, the rush for lounge chairs decreased quite a bit as peak season had ended, so the rush on pool chairs and rentals might only be an issue during peak seasons. Activities: The Teralani catamaran snorkel cruise was excellent, which I highly recommend. Driving to Hana was also well worth it. Hana itself is okay, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the drive there and the stops along the way that are the real attraction. Snorkeling at Black Rock is excellent, but can get crowded. Lots of people come from other areas to the stretch of beach in front of the Sheraton, as it is probably the best stretch of beach along Kaanapali. The pool at the Sheraton is nice, but some of the other resorts have pools that are more like a water park, such as the Westin, the Maui Ocean Club, and the Grand Wailea on the south side of the island. If you are bringing the kids and they want the water park experience, you may want to consider one of those hotels. If you want the best beach, go to the Sheraton. Restaurants: We ate at many great restaurants while we were there, but also had some disappointments. In general, the restaurants located at hotels were less appealing than the stand-alone establishments. Hula Grill was my favorite. Just about a quarter-mile walk along the beach path from the Sheraton in the Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village (a very nice outdoor mall). Both their dining area, as well as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153barefoot bar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd were excellent. I also enjoyed Leilani\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village. Lahaina has many great restaurants- we ate at Ruth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Chris because my wife had never been to one, which was great. We also ate at Mama\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Fish House on the east side of Maui, which was excellent with an incredible view and grounds, but they try to up-sell you on everything, the most ridiculous being coffee after dinner \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can get the house coffee, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to talk you into the premium coffee for even more $! The breakfast buffet at the Sheraton was very good, but way overpriced at $25 per person. Tepanyaki-Dan was also very good, but it took 45 minutes before our table\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Tepanyaki Chef to begin cooking. The Sushi restaurant at the Mariott Ocean Club was good, but way too understaffed with their servers very overwhelmed despite their best efforts. The most disappointing meal was at the Tropica restaurant at the Westin. We singed up for their New-Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve Gala Dinner for $95 a plate, and had terrible service. They were completely unorganized. Meals on your own: Everything is expensive on Maui. Tropical drinks at the Sheraton go for about $9 each, and dinner for two is usually going to run between $70-$140 or more very easily. Because of this, we decided to do most breakfasts and lunches on our own, and then order as many drinks and go to as many nice dinners as we wanted. We stopped by the Safeway in Lahaina to stock up on breakfast and lunch groceries, and made use of the refrigerator in our room. The ABC store in Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village also has some grocery items. We also picked up a travel cooler at Long\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Drug store in Lahaina to take lunches with us to the beach. This worked out very well, so if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to stick to a budget, this helped out a lot. In all, we had a great time. While some of the resorts in Wailea might be a little more luxurious, the Sheraton seemed to strike just the right balance between being a beautiful upscale resort while having a laid back atmosphere.

I traveled with my husband and two sons, 12 and 15. Check in was great. The valet was ready to help with our bags and the front desk check-in and check-out was a breeze. They were friendly and top notch. They gave us a lei and helped us get familiar with the area and our room. We got upgraded from a ocean view to an ocean view deluxe. Our suite was great. We had 2 queen beds, 1 \u00c2\u00bd baths, a family area, a beautiful view of the ocean on the nice sized deck, and a small refrigerator, sink, and microwave. The location (building 5) was right by the beach and pool. I really enjoyed the yoga classes in the morning. They really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have many activities for my family. They offered yoga twice a week while we were there. They also had two aqua-aerobic classes twice but the pool was too cool for me. I would have liked a little more organized activities. We loved our room and the area. Here is the problem. They have way too many people to accommodate at the beach. They lounges were rented out when we checked. There wasn't even much room to throw down a towel--we ended up right in from of the path leading from the pool area to the beach (right in the way!). That was the only day we spent at the beach because every day we tried it was the same situation. The pool chairs filled up quickly also. That isn't a problem because we are from the Midwest and getting up early and throwing a towel on the chair isn't a problem. What was a problem was that the pool was cold!! It isn't heated. For me and my family when it is in the lower 80's we need the pool to be lukewarm at least. It was icy. I am surprised that more people don't mention this. We went to the pool about 4 times and every time there was less than a hand full of people actually in the water! We tried but just couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enjoy it. Also, I felt guilty saving a spot for my family when people around me are trying to get a lounge and there aren't any! But if I didn't hold one my husband and kids wouldn't have one when they would come to join me. That just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t right. I thought the Sheraton did a lot right but they were crowded and the pools need heated. Also, the pool side food is not recommended. Really because we planned on doing one fun trip a day and spending the rest of the time at the beach or pool the lack of beach accommodations and icy pool really made our down time complicated. We struggled with knowing how to spend that time. We love people but we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like crowds. The beach was crowded. The walk on Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali was crowded.

For our family, Sheraton was the preferred location overall. Your opinion may be different. Read on. Westin Maui: 1. Extremely hectic feeling (the landscape is awesome with waterfalls but add a ton of people noise during the day and it loses ambience quickly) 2. Has more staff on hand to assist you 3. Keiki (Children's) Camp is awesome (especially Nicole, their counselor) 4. Ono Grill serves decent food at high price 5. Terrace serves pretty good food and great view 6. Very helpful and friendly staff 7. Very nicely equipped workout room (didn't use a minute of it!) 8. Good pools Sheraton Maui: 1. Awesome snorkeling right at your footstep 2. Relaxed and more serene atmosphere (reminds us of Jamaica) 3. Ample parking 4. Fabulous view (if you get ocean front) 5. Fairly helpful staff but minimally staffed compared to Westin 6. Restaurant food match up to prices quite well (except for the breakfast buffet) 7. Kid's pool - wading area and 3 ft area Not very impressed by both locations' rooms and bathrooms but no complains since we spent minimal time in the rooms even though we had ocean front/view rooms. If you have little kids, both places are fun but Sheraton has the kid's pool. Older kids will prefer the Westin slides at their pools. If you want to try out snorkeling and scuba, definitely pick Sheraton because it's right at your doorstep. We decided on the Starwood properties over other properties like Hyatt and Ritz (all about the same price as we received great package offers.) We checked out both locations and was very happy with our decisions. Hyatt probably has better pools but was even more crowded! The thing that pushed us to Sheraton over Hyatt was the beach. Review on Hyatt's lack of beach was the major reason we avoided Hyatt and the review was correct. To get my little ones to the beach was not as easy at the Ritz as it was surrounded by the golf course. If you decide on Maui, do get the \"Maui Revealed\" book if you intend to venture outside of your resort. You'll find great tidepools, beaches, activities and food recommendations. As for food, if you decide to eat at Whaler's Village, we love Leilani's (lunch and dinner). Hula Grill was quite good too. Rusty Harpoon service and food is mediocre at best (lunch and dinner). Sansei close to Ritz at Kapalua is as good as advertised. Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina is decent but Da Kitchen in Kihei serves awesome local food. For Califonians, you will most likely find David Paul a tad bit overrated. Wished we had time to try Pacific'O. We found no reason to try Moose McGillycuddys or Roys as they're readily available in California. Hope this helps. Definitely get \"Maui Revealed\" book. Enjoy your trip.

We stayed in two different rooms: Room 6104, building 6, 1st Floor. This was a nice room, especially since it had a king bed, but....after flying for 5.5 hours and another 1.5 hours between luggage and getting to the hotel, we arrived at about 11 pm. only to be greeted by a little twit at the front desk, who will remain nameless. She sighed and typed, sighed and typed, rolled her eyes when we told her that I had re-confirmed our reservation the previous day, had a confirmation number and that the room we requested, and paid for already, was in building 5. She insisted that no particular building was guaranteed and that she'd have to put us in Bldg. 3 until something else came available. I told her that we had paid $550 extra for a Deluxe Ocean Front room in Bldg. 5 and that was where we wanted to be. More sighing, typing, eye-rolling, etc. This continued for about 10 minutes. I am usually a very patient person, but at about this point I was getting angry. She then said they \"might\" be able to put us in an Ocean View with a king, but not a Deluxe Ocean Front. Finally one of the other front desk people came to her and \"helped\" her find a room in Bldg. 6 with a Deluxe Ocean Front w/King bed. I really wanted to throttle her at this point, but was too tired to work up the energy. So that was our first \"Aloha\" from the staff. I must say, however, that she was the only staff person we had trouble with our entire stay. Everyone else was very friendly and wanting to assist in any way possible. The next day my husband called the front desk, asked for the manager, and told him what had happened the night before on our arrival. He apologized profusely and said they would have a Deluxe Ocean Front available in Bldg. 5 Saturday morning. We told him that would be fine and we did move that day. Actually the porter moved our luggage over to Room 5806 while we spent the day in Oahu. The rooms in Bldg. 5 are much nicer than in Bldg. 6. A bit bigger, crown moulding, even in the bathroom, ceiling fan, doorbell, and much bigger balcony. The room we were in was actually part of a suite. To get to our room there were double doors then our room was on the left with another door on the right that was a really big room. Next time we'll be staying in one of those! I cannot comment on the food as we ate elsewhere on this trip except for the day after we arrived we spent a couple of hours at the Lagoon Terrace, had a couple cocktails and sandwich, which was fine if expensive. The pool was very nice and we enjoyed that several times while there. It was never terribly crowded either and the hot tub was nice too. We did snorkel at Black Rock and saw some great fish. We simply rented our gear right on the beach there for $8/hr. The nightly dive into the ocean by the young man never got boring for us watching him make his way across the beach, up the rocks (barefooted of course), and paying tribute to the ocean by throwing his Lei into the water and diving gracefully into the water below. Cocktails were good with liberal amounts of alcohol in them, nicely served. Of course everything at hotels is expensive here so I won't go in to that. Being in those buildings we were able to park up near where our rooms were, which was very nice. TIP: If you are in Building 5 you can drive up to another entry area with groceries, etc. and don't have to walk all the way from the parking lot with heavy stuff.You can't park there but it is a good drop-off location. TIP: Stop at Safeway on your way to the hotel to pick up those extras you need to get. It's cheaper than getting them at the hotel or in Lahaina's ABC stores. We also brought along a soft-sided cooler that folded into my suitcase. THis came in handy when out being a tourist and it'll save you some money on drinks and snacks. We also used it to bring beverages down to the pool. Also, if you have to check out from your room but aren't leaving until later in the day, the baggage can be left at the front desk in a secure room and you can either go out and about, or stay and enjoy your last hours at the pool, etc. You keep your key-card and you can use the health facility for showering, etc. They have towels, blow dryers, lockers, and showers up there. In closing, we will go back to this hotel. We adored our room in Building 5 with our views of the mountains, grounds, and ocean. Particularly leaving the sliding door open, listening to the luau down below with the music and the warm breezed blowing. Magical!!! We loved the hotel, the room, the people and enjoyed peace and quiet when we wanted to, explored the island and fell in love with Maui, in general.

Valet Parking was very reasonable and self parking was free. There are only a few things I see that could make this an even better hotel. One would be to redo the lobby adding a lobby bar and create better views of the ocean and property. There is a nice water feature around the exterior of the lobby but it actually blocks your view of the nice streams with fish and the swimming pool below.

We agreed to take a \"partial ocean view\" room with a king instead and to our surprise, we were placed next door in a room that was closer to the ocean. Hmmm. Kind of blows away the \"free upgrade\" deal that honeymooners are told they are getting. Not a deal breaker though. We would have appreciated something for our inconvenience, but received nothing.

Because there is one BIG wild card: events they hold on the grounds. Big, loud events, with big speakers pointed at your $450 lanai. We went to Maui with our little boy to get a break from our very hectic and stressful lives. To us, this hotel meant that after our son was asleep (about 8 pm), my husband and I would be able to sit on the lanai with some tea, and listen to the ocean in our very expensive ocean front room. We desperately needed and expected quiet! But for 4 NIGHTS out of our 6 NIGHT stay, there were events taking place outside our window. Our son could not sleep with the loud music! How the Sheraton can justify this is absolutely beyond me. When you complain, they're apologetic, but that doesn't help you feel any less disappointed.

While Sheraton can't get credit for that, having a room right ON the beach sure was nice. Our first room was smaller than the second. I highly reccomend building 4 or 5, as we didn't care for the room on the otherside. We had both a full ocean view and a deluxe ocean view and loved both of them. Our room wasn't outdated at all and had the largest bathroom of any other room we have stayed in (and husband travels for work). We can't wait to go back and wil stay here again. I loved it!!!!

We can't figure out why the Westin is slightly higher priced except for maybe the sheets have a higher thread count. I would recommend the Westin however for kids as their were many more of them and the pool was a virtually a kid's playground-not as suited for honeymooners.

We were booked for their Honeymoon special (upgrade to an ocean view room, champagne at arrival, etc.) but we had to ask for everything upon arrival (got our champagne 2 days later) and it looked as though they gave us a room in Building 2 that was reserved for someone else but I have no complaints about the room. The room was spacious, clean, and had a great view of the property and ocean. The staff were nice but the young woman who checked us in seemed inexperienced and led to my frustration when I asked her questions and she had to ask others before she answered me. Then the day before we checked out I had a phone message that said I didn't give her my booking voucher from my travel agent showing payment...which I had and the desk clerk had given back to me saying she had all the information she needed. (What was needed was better desk staff training). Anyway, our bed was wonderful...the best I have ever slept in and it was nice having coffee, and a refridgerator in the room...cut the cost of eating out for every meal. All the other staff we came into contact with were wonderful...we were given a lei at arrival and greeted by a very friendly gentleman who greeted us every time he saw us...made us feel very welcome. We didn't eat on the property (thought it was kind of expensive) but found nice places to eat within walking distance (the Hula Grill - their fish & chips were yummy). The staff near the reception desk gave us chocolates, helped us book a dinner cruise, and get pineapples to bring home and were able to answer any of our questions (they sit at desks opposite the reception area so be sure and chat with them). The Pool at the Sheraton was really nice even though a small area was being worked on. We didn't have any problems getting drinks and there were always lounge chairs available and more friendly pool staff around to help you if needed. The pool was clean and we enjoyed using it nearly every day...(it seemed that most people preferred to sit around the pool than get in the water so it was never crowded). We didn't have any problem parking our rental card and although you are charged a daily resort fee (of $17) it was reasonable to what we had to pay in Oahu...and so much nicer.

We honestly felt that for these people perhaps they just can't be happy with anything. We discovered that many people who vacation here are from the west coast and vacation here regularly. Perhaps their expectations are a bit unrealistic. We have traveled to many other vacation resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico so we felt we could objectively rate this resort.

We had two rooms next to each other and were in block 3 with an Ocean View and a very short walk to the beach. The hotel is fabulous and without doubt the best on Kaanapali. We had 12 days at the hotel at the end of the season and had the best vacation ever. A few tips / comments which I hope will be helpful: 1. Try priceline - we paid $150 a night for the hotel which by all accounts is a real bargain 2. DO NOT USE BOSS FROGS - please - they lie in their adverts - you can get cheaper masks and snorkels at Whalers Village at Maui Divers - they will also provide a real fish guide and de-fog - also the people they have are actually human and can hold a conversation and explain what is needed etc rather than simply be an outlet for selling trips etc 3. The restaurant at the hotel is a great buy if you have kids as they eat free and with the buffet it is a rel bargain. 4. Contrary to popular opinion (or is it just marketing?) BJ Pizza in Lahaina is awful - you will wait over half an hour for a part baked pizza with a base of at least an inch! 5. Try Bubba Gumps Shrimp in Lahaina as they do a great fish and chips and it is really good value. Other places to eat that we tried were: - Hula Grill - went there twice and enjoyed it - Leilani's - OK but not as good as Hula Grill - Food Court (Chinese) - actually quiet a nice meal. 6. There is a coffee shop in the hotel but you have to ask for the coffee to be extra hot as they barista (apologies to all Starbucks employees) does not have a thermometer and was always making cold coffee (used her hand to guage the temperature) you would have thought after being asked over 5 times she may have cottoned on to the fact that she made cold coffee?! 7. Lahaina is a great place but it is really costly to park but well worth a few visits. 8. Maui is expensive but it does not need to be - we had breakfasts in the room as Shearton provide a fridge and also had most lunches there too. From the garbage outside other rooms I think we were not alone in this. If you are going to do this then go to Safeway in Lahaina and make sure that you join their loyalty club as they have some great buys. 9. There are millions of activities that are offered and with 4 kids we could only do a few but would really recommend: - surf lessons (Royal Lahaina we used but they are busy an IF there is surf on Kaanapli I think that a more local one may be better) - Sunrise on Haleakala - it is a really great view but getting up at 2am is not so great 10. Please object to the management about the resort fee as if you don't it will continue forever and it is an abhorent practice - we had two rooms and managed to get them to waive half the fee for one of the rooms. 11. The pool is a great place and if you go to the Keiki pool (if you have kids of course) then we got beds by the pool on all the days that we went there. 12. We liked the Hard Rock in Lahaina too and they actually have something different (to PB&J, Chicken Strips, Burger etc) for Kids I hope that this is helpful Overall a realy great hotel and beautiful setting", "Date": "September 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales, United Kingdom (UK)", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute heaven, best hotel & location!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3834356", "Content": "Well what can I say - my rating explains everything!!!!

The first time I went there they were building the Whaler's Village. As a child I stayed at the Sheraton and the Maui Surf. With our children my husband and I have stayed at the Westin, the Marriott and for the first time since the remodel, the Sheraton. I booked our reservations through Starwood in May. My intention was to book at the Westin but the woman at Starwood said that we should take advantage of the Stay at 1, play at 3 offering and get a full ocean front room rather than paying the same price at the Westin for an ocean view. And we could STILL GO TO THE WESTIN POOL! Well....you know the outcome of that. Without any warning they discontinued that program. Check-in: Our first room was in building 3. Lovely room. You could see the ocean if you went out on to the balconey and walked to the far end and leaned over. I was very unhappy. It took our bellman 5 minutes to arrange to have us transfered to a lesser room in the old building. But this room had an ocean view. They did deduct $10 a night for our room. The bathroom was dirty. And being on vacation, I cleaned up the surfaces myself as opposed to complaining and pulling a princess act. (I am NOT a germaphobe or unduly fussy). The fact that we didn't get our ocean front room was disturbing, but we're on vacation. The next morning my daughter and I were in the bathroom. She turned on the shower which contains a handheld shower head. I hear a huge thud. The very heavy shower head missed my daughter by inches. By now I was furious. My daughter would have been gravely hurt and the room was dirty. I went to the Manager, at 7 a.m. and was not the happiest of clients. My daughter could have been badly hurt (the most importent issue) due to a faulty shower head, I had to clean our bathroom, and we didn't get the room we paid for initially. (I had the paperwork with me.) We did get our room changed. This time we did get our ocean front room in the far building. It was nice (not spectacular), clean, and the shower head secure. We then went on vacation. The pool at the Sheraton doesn't have the bells and whistles of the Westin. But unlike the Westin it is calm, clean and you don't have to scream to be heard. The pool staff is wonderful. We rented a gazebo for 4 days and while pricey, about $70 or $75 per day, we didn't get sunburned. They definitely need more gazebos. We would have rented a gazebo everyday, had they been available. The pool food was very mediocre, usually cold. And if you want to eat by the bar the wait was 40 to 45 minutes for a hamburger. The excuse was that only 1 side of the barbque was working...for a week. The girls who walked around taking orders seemed to bring the food more quickly. They were truly very nice. The Starwood Concierge was very helpful with dinner reservations. We knew where we wanted to go from previous visits and she suggested some additional places. The Room Dance, as I call it, seems to be a more common practice. I am tired of going to a nice hotel with confirmed reservations and being given a lesser room hoping that there are no complaints. We don't always complain (because we were able to check into our room in Italy at 10 a.m. instead of 4 after travelling for a day, we were exhausted and happy to see a shower), but I sincerely tired of what seems to be a increasingly common practice.

We were right next to the beach (in the side of Black Rock itself) and had a view all the way down the beach, the ocean, the pool, the gardens, and the mountains. The room itself was average, but the bed (Sweet Sleeper) was very comfortable with down pillows and comforter. As for the beach, it is absolutely the best location on Kaanapali (and we think the best on Maui)! The ocean was calm, which was great for snorkeling or swimming and the water was very clear. Sheraton has the biggest beach (by far) for a resort on Maui (as far as we could tell).

My only complaint about the Sheraton was the poolside dining. We tried lunch at the pool bar one day and found it to be too expensive for what you got and the quality was not very good. This complaint was very minor for us because we just ended up walking down to Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s village for lunch. We did eat breakfast at the Sheraton buffet twice and really enjoyed it, but it was $50 for the both of us so we ended up going to Safeway for food and ate on our lanai most mornings.

Turned out to be better than expected! We usually stay at 4 and 5 star hotels. I'm not sure what this is rated, but we were very pleased and comfortable. We've stayed at the Grand Wailea. The beach at the Sheraton is better than at the Grand Wailea. It's a beautiful, wide, sandy beach at the end of Kaanapali Beach protected by a cove where Black Rock is, and the water is clear at least 20' down. (We didn't go out much deeper). Snorkeling is right in front of the beach in the cove, and kids can jump off Black Rock. Snorkeling rentals are ridiculous, though, because you can buy a mask and snorkle down the street at Long's Drugstore for almost the same price. Or just bring your own from home. The swimming is fabulous, the fish and sea turtle were beautiful to watch. You don't have to drive anywhere to snorkel. It's right there! Also, here's a tip on the beach chairs. Those around the pool are first come, first serve. Be prepared to get up early if you want a shady spot. We're talking 7am to get down there and put something on the chair to save it. If you want two chairs on the beach with umbrella, it'll be $30 and the rental hut opens at 8am. Again, line up by 7:45 am. They're usually gone by 8:45 am. If you want two chairs with the attached covering thing that goes over them, that's $35 and you can reserve those in advance, but do it your first day there because they also book up fast. They also have cabanas around the pool that fit four chairs underneath. We didn't check into that but I heard one person say $75/day. The rooms have all been refurbished so they look more modern. In fact, we could still smell fresh paint in our room and lots of the rooms were still being renovated. But we heard no noise from it, so it didn't bother us. Beds were comfortable, bathrooms were modern. The grounds are huge and spread out! We really liked that! Kids can play on the grass. There's a big area at the front of the hotel near the beach for weddings and events. If you go down to the Westin, which is also a Starwood property, it's jam packed in! People were wall to wall in chairs around the pool, and the beach is not as nice. Although they'll even tell you at the Sheraton that if you want to use the spa, use the Westin's, which I did and enjoyed it. It wasn't the Grand Wailea Spa, one of my fav's, but it had a steam room, sauna, and very small jacuzzi (only two can fit comfortably). But the quiet, waiting room was beautiful with chairs and recliners overlooking the ocean and fresh beverages, tea, and biscotti. And the treatments were great - a Lomi-Lomi massage and a Tropical Scrub with Vichy Shower. The breakfast buffet at the Sheraton has just about everything, but for $22.50/person, come on, $50 for two for breakfast?! The nice thing is they have a mini frig in the rooms and we went and bought fruit and drinks at the Safeway 5 mins. down the road (near Long's). The gym was not much to speak of, just a few treadmills and a couple other machines. When we arrived, it was late at night and my husband and I were given two double beds on the bottom floor facing the mountains. We had asked for a king. So then we were taken to a king room, also mountain view, but it had an air freshener machine blowing and that can only mean one thing to us - they're trying to get rid of some odor. So we still voiced our displeasure and ended up with a king bed suite (larger room) on the 5th floor ocean view! Patio fit 2 chairs and a small table and the view was fabulous! The staff were always very attentive and friendly. You can self-park to save a few bucks over valet. There is a $17/day tax added/room. Daily maid service, daily paper. Good restaurants in town - Longhi's & Gerards in Lahaina and Sansei in Kapalua. Five min. walk to nice shopping & eating at Whaler's Village.

It only took us 40 minutes or less to get there from the airport. My husband parked at the front of the hotel and right away there was a guy who approached him and showed him where we will be checking in and had someone help us out with our bags. (The guy was \"The ambassador of Aloha\" for the hotel). As we were checked in the front lady greeted us with our leis. And with that we got another surprise, our \"partial ocean view room\" was just upgraded for free to the \"ocean front room\". We were going to hint to them that its our 5th anniversary but she upgraded us without being hinted. My husband even told her that we have the partial ocean view, making sure we dont have to pay extra, but she somehow just ignored that and gave us the better room for free anyway. The view was amazing. And our room happened to be nestled to the \"big rock\". And being on the 2nd floor was extra helpful since we have our 1 1/2 year old son with us. The balcony overlooks the entire beach front and ofcourse the room was great too, nice king size bed, great bathroom, we used the fridge alot, the cabinets were spacious, everything was perfect. The service was wonderful. I had signed up for a their Hula lessons. So my family and I was waiting by the activity tent when we noticed that the \"ambassador of aloha\" walked by the pool area (we are already sitting by the lounge chairs) and noticed that he was looking for someone. I just found out that he was looking for me. Unfortunately the hula lesson was cancelled since the instructor had an emergency and is about to have twins. (I totally understand that, being a mom and all) So he was looking for me since he left us a message at our room but we were already downstairs waiting for the class. So he was roaming around the hotel asking around where I am since they did not want me to be dissapointed with the hotel. (I really liked that!) Since I know how big that hotel is and I can imagine how hard it was to look for one person in such a large place. Everyone in the hotel was friendly, they will greet and smile at you at all times as you walk by them. Checking in on you if your having a great time. The free classes that they have are nice too. The staff are very friendly. The food at the Lagoon Bar was great. You have to try the nachos it fed me, my husband and our son. And ofcourse the Lava Flow was excellent. This was my family's first trip to Hawaii and as first timers our expectation was extremely high. The Sheraton Maui had exceeded our expectations. The hotel was beyond beautiful, the staffs are friendly and extremely helpful, the food was excellent, the pool is so pretty with water falls, adult section, kids section and baby section, the beach front is the best location because of the black rock. (You have to see the sunset, cliff dive, it was very dramatic) So all I can give the Sheraton Maui is 5 stars and 2 thumbs up and more. My family and I will definitely come back and I recommend for you to take your family here too and I guarantee you will have a wonderful vacation.", "Date": "August 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cbest location beach, unwanted critters\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3758325", "Content": "I stayed at the Sheraton in Maui from July 29- Aug 5 in building 3 with an ocean view. We went with family frineds and requested a room next to each other but when we got there that didn't happen. We both still got our ocean view rooms, which was even better then we expected, on the same floor. The room was very nice but had a light musty scent. The a.c worked great. We always had a nice cool room to come back to. The beds rocked! So comfy I fell right to sleep everynight and never had trouble with the beds. In past hotels I have had hard beds that feel like sheet metal. The TV was a bit small. The balcony was nice it had two chairs and a small round table. The bathroom was a good size, even for 3 girls. =) The showered worked great as well. Then the very unwanted happend, the first morning of our stay I went into the restroom to find a roach. I HATE HATE HATE bugs. After that we seen a few a day, mostly in the restroom, 2 in the safe (yes, they even got into a locked safe), another 2 in the closet, and 1 in the dresser. Not fun for me at all. Thank God my mom was there to smash them. There is a note telling you that you might have \"critters\" due to tropical climits but I expected WAY MORE from a Sheraton. Our family frineds did not have any unwanted visitors but they did have a really strong scent of mold. Not good at all. As far as the location on the beach its awesome!! We went snorkeling and seen so many fish. It really is a sight to see. The beach is very clean and very child frinedly. The pool is awesome too. You have to get up early if you want a chiar by the pool, they go quick. The pool is really big, its like a lagoon that children young and old will love. It has a small slide as well. The walk to Whalers Village is about 10-15 min. not too bad, plus its all beach side. I highly suggest NOT eatting at Hula Grill, not one of us liked it. They had BAD over priced food. We never ate at the Sheraton so I can't comment of the food. The parking is easy and if you valet they are all really really nice. Bell boys are very nice and helpful. The front desk girls didn't give the warmest welcome. The over all look of the hotel is really nice, clean, and welcoming. I would stay here again because of the great beach location. Oh one last thing I didn't care for was the resort fee, we were out so much of the time that is kind of a waste of 17 bucks.

Everything except scuba was arranged in advance through the Sheraton concierge (very easy) who has a list of activities on their web site. The activities for 5 people, excluding scuba, cost $2000. I recommend all the activities. Whalers Village is nice for an evening stroll. As for Lahaina I recommend dining at Cool Cats, Mala and Coolers for casual dining and above average food.

When we arrived on Maui it took us 2 hours just to get here from the airport, traffic was horrible, due to on-lookers for a car that had been abandoned from an accident.

The rooms were prety decent and clean, and the beds were extremy comfy. The view of the grounds , beach, and ocean were truely breathtaking. The following morning we were still on Dallas time and were up by 5 am so decided to take advantage of the close to empty beach. Go snorkeling early if you want it all to yourself, by early we mean right after sunrise. The snorkeling there was great, saw many fishes, and even a few giant sea turtles, the turtles are definently not shy as they will come right next to you. This is all on the hotel's beach. We tried the hotel's breakfast buffet , while we were eating we were chuckeling about a guy's reaction when he took a look at his bill that the waiter placed in front of him, we soon had the same reaction. Be prepared to pay at least $22.50 a person for an average meal. by the way the pool is great for kids and anyone whole enjoys wading around. We would recomend going down to Whaler's Village to eat. While you're in Maui you must try the 38 mile Haleakala Volcano bike ride, while you're biking down there's a great Mexican Restaurant and many little shops.

Had a rental car and the self parking lot was easily accessible and never a problem to park in. We did experience a problem with our oceanview room on arrival as all of the flowers off of the lanais in our particular section were stone dead and somewhat took away from the pool and oceanview. We made the management aware immediately and they were willing to move us to another room which was slightly larger but not oceanview so we opted against that. In effort to accommodate our concerns they did wave the daily resort fee for some of the time we stayed and as well gave us a dining certificate and promised they would have new flowers planted on Monday, as this was a Saturday. Monday came and upon our return from the beach as promised, new flowers had been planted. We had a few minor problems with a lamp fixture and a broken spring in one of the beds and again they addressed them and compensated us with more dining certificates. A downside was the cost of eating at any of the resort dining facilities as well as the choices were not particularly kid friendly. We drove into Lahaina and ate a couple of evenings there. Getting a chair by the pool was not always possible, but the beach is beautiful and the sand so white and clean we only took a few dips in the pool. Had picked this place because of the recommendations for snorkeling right off of the beach and it did not disappoint us as many beautiful fish as well as sea turtles were seen without having to go through the trouble of booking one of the many available snorkeling tours.

Overall, a very nice hotel in a great location. Our room was pretty average (where was the fan in the bathroom???), however, the beds were the most comfortable beds ever for a hotel; we slept great (it would have been nice, though, to have the option of getting two queen beds instead of two doubles). Our room was in building 3 with a nice view of the grounds, the pool, and the ocean. We liked the convenience of being able to self-park at the hotel, whereas at other resorts you have to use the valet service, which gets very expensive! Loved the beach and the snorkeling! On the downside, however, we tried the breakfast buffet one morning at around 10:30, got seated, had our first round of food, only to have the doors close at 11:00. It would have been very helpful if the hotel had posted the hours of the breakfast buffet; we might have gone earlier. The food itself was pretty cold and below average, and way too expensive for the basic eggs, bacon, etc. We had a much better selection of food at the Hyatt breakfast buffet and it was $1 cheaper! We were also very disappointed to find out that the \"Stay at One, Play at All\" was no longer in effect as of July 1, 2005. One of the reasons we chose the Sheraton was that it gave us the option of trying out the other Starwood pools. Why weren't we notified in some way that we would not be able to do so? A very bad decision by the Sheraton!! We might have reconsidered our decision to stay there. Also, our room was not always cleaned on a consistent basis. One day it would be cleaned by 11:00, other days it wasn't cleaned until almost 4:00. It's very frustrating to come back after a day in the hot sun wanting to relax in a clean, air-conditioned room, only to find out that it hasn't been cleaned.

We have 2 young children and wanted to find a calm beach and a hotel with a water slide. After much research, we chose to stay at the Sheraton because of the protected beach and the advertised \"stay at one, play at all\" privileges that would have enabled us to use the water slide at the Westin. My son was quite excited to use the water slide and we tried to use it as soon as we arrived. However, we were terribly disappointed to learn that we were not allowed to use the pool facilities despite receiving a brochure at check-in that described the privileges. When I showed management the brochure, they said it was given to us in error and that the privileges had ended the month prior. They explained we still had the privilege of making room charges at Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurants \u00e2\u20ac\u201c imagine that \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could still do everything that entailed getting another buck out of us. I booked the hotel 6 months in advance and complained that I should have been notified of the change so that I could move my reservations over to the Westin. The best they could do was to apologize and credit our account each day for the daily room charge. Yes, it was nice that they gave us a credit, but tell that to my son. The worse part about the whole circumstance is that they allowed the Westin guests to use the Sheraton pool. It really made us feel like second-class guests. It sure was something to sit around the pool and listen to other Sheraton guests complain about the same treatment. We stayed in a deluxe ocean-view room at the top of black rock. The three elevator rides to the beach were not bothersome as you never had to wait for the elevators, and the walk through the corridors offered some good views of the grounds and ocean. Our room was a good-sized room with a great view off the balcony. I would say the room quality was only average, and the carpet could have used a good cleaning. Our toilet started leaking from the floor and they fixed it promptly; however, it threw off the maid and our room was never cleaned that day even after we called to let them know. We really loved the beach at this resort; although it was hard to find available chairs and umbrellas to rent. Snorkeling was awesome and we always saw the turtles. The sand is nice and no rocks or shells to hurt your feet. The grounds were maintained very nicely and the kids enjoyed the fishpond. It was very nice that the hotel was walking distance to Whalers Village as we had many good meals at the restaurants there. I do not recommend eating at the Sheraton, unless you are too tired to do anything else. The food is only mediocre for the money you spend. If you have a car, drive everywhere else to eat. I highly recommend going to the Hyatt for their Luau. The entertainment and food was outstanding and the service was beyond expectations.

I chose this location with some reservations after reading a few bad posts but the location drew me to stay there. We arrived at noon and were quickly checked in, even though we were alittle early. We stayed in building 6, which is a full-ocean view on top of black rock. Yes, you have to take 3 elevators to make it to the beach, but it was well worth it because of the great location. I never found the elevators to me a problem, more of an amusing journey than anything. The room was basic but had a great view; the premium price is for the view of Lanai and Molokai, definitely not the room. The people were generally friendly, with the exception of the Spa. The spa people really need a lesson on customer service. The best however, were the bellboys. They were quite friendly. Not once did I feel the cheesy sales pitch of a time-share people. I saw them daily, but they were not a problem. The daily room charge of 17.50 is cheezy, but it seems all the hotels are adding this charge in. Buy water, drinks, snacks elsewhere and save some $$. Frankly, I preferred a drink I made and enjoyeed on the balcony far better than the weak drinks at the bars. One mixed thing is the location of the beach, which gets quite crowded. You must reserve lounge chairs at least a day in advance & chairs with umbrellas are rented at a first come, first serve starting at 8am. A plus is that you are within 5 minutes walking to Whalers Village where there are restaurants and shops, but if you like less people on the beach try the east side of black rock, it is less crowded. We ate at the morning buffet and found it to be good with friendly wait staff. We ate 2 times and had drinks at the bars and found it to be average. We had drinks at the bar one evening and found the service to be below average. Do watch the evening torch lighting and cliff dive; it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to enjoy a wonderful sunset. Lastly, snorkeling. They charge scandalous amounts for rental of snorkel gear. Buy your own and pack it, you wont be sharing, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll save a lot of money, will have it every day and will be able to keep it for your next trip. I saw dozens of turtles right off black rock, but it was crowded with lots of people also. If you stay on the east side of black rock in Kaanapali try the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old airport\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little less crowded. Also, if you really want to see coral and lots of fish in a less crowded environment, try Honolua Bay, past Kapalua. Great snorkeling off on the right side of the marine sanctuary! In closing, you can find a lot better and a lot worse. I think the best thing as you embark on your Hawaiian adventure is to breathe deep and use a little Aloha spirit, then its all good.

The hotel was wonderful! We arrived late afternoon on Saturday (after a couple of VERY long flights). We were greeted at our car by very friendly staff (Aloha! almost becomes annoying). The gentleman told us that there must be a mistake because our room only had a king size bed. Trust me that would not hold the four of us. We were told that our travel agent made a mistake. Our travel agent had booked the lowest cost room (partial ocean view), but those rooms only have king beds. The staff was VERY helpful getting this changed, we never had to complain at all. The manager came out and gave us the deluxe oceanview room. A four level upgrade at no charge. This all took maybe fifteen minutes and was handled very professionally. We were led to our room by Benjamin. He was extremely friendly and helpful and really made us feel welcome. Gave us all the info on the hotel and the surrounding area, plus sight seeing tips. My experience is mostly with Florida and Caribbean resorts, with this being our first and probably only Hawaii trip. The view from the room was certainly deluxe, outstanding view over the ocean over to Molokai, but the room was strictly Holiday Inn. Small, clean, with two double beds. I'm used to more in a 'deluxe' room, but I understand that is expected in Hawaii, we pay for the location. We did have a problem in the room. After taking a shower we learned that the bathtub was clogged. We called down to housekeeping before stepping out and it was all fixed when we got back. Not a problem for us. We used the beach and the pool quite a lot. Both were perfect. We had great weather and neither the beach or the pool was crowded. Even at 11AM we had no trouble finding pool chairs. The pool is quite large, basically a very nice sized 8' adult pool connected to a 3' children's pool via a 5' pool 'river' for about 30 feet. A 3 foot slide separates the two sections. A small hot tub is right off the center of the pool. A very nice upscale resort pool, unfortunately it closed at 8PM. No real surf at the beach, waves 1 to 2 feet, some kids trying to boogy board but not much of that. Sand was perfect for sandcastling. But watch unprotected feet! Pool deck and sand get VERY VERY hot. Always 5 to 8 kids jumping off of Black Rock, they sure were a lot braver than us. We never saw any apparent cruise ship crowds using the beach, it always looked less than half full. We ate breakfast at the hotel twice, standard buffet fare with an omelet station. It was over $100 for the four of us, but we're used to resort costs. Our first server's name was Jessie and he was excellent, talked to us about the food and Hawaii and a little about his background. Another excellent staff member who helped make this a more personal experience. When we returned two days later, we had a different server, but Jessie came over to say Hi and check on us, by name. We looked at the evening buffet, but it didn't have a very good selection, so we passed. Lots of places around the hotel to eat. I think we went to Hard Rock that evening. We also ate at Teppan-Yaki Dan's. A great chef although this experience felt somewhat like a production line with different servers and the brief appearance by the chef as he went from table to table. Food was good, but of course expensive. Our room did require us to take three elevators from our room to the beach/pool/lobby/restaurants, but only took a few minutes and was not a problem. A small price to pay for our quiet room looking over the Pacific. Our section also had a private parking lot which was very convenient. We passed by the timeshare desk every day and were only greeted with an Aloha! each time. They never tried to sell to us. We did go snorkeling once while we were there with the gear from the Hotel ($33 for 1 hour for 4 of us). We were told we could go to Boss Frog and get it cheaper, but we only intended to go snorkeling once. We saw fish and turtles, it was very nice. There were probably always about 10 people snorkeling, but there is a lot of room. One large turtle came into the beach area in about 7' of water, very cool. We never use the fitness/tennis/golf facilities so I can't comment on those. We watched the evening torch lighting and cliff dive, but after seeing kids diving from there all day, it didn't seem like much. Wonderful staff, beautiful location, great beach, great pool, not crowded. What more could we ask from our vacation?

It was beautiful w/ tradition and we made a point to catch it the rest of the time we were there. Get to the pool area about 30 min before the ceremony so you can relax and really enjoy it.

We snorkeled one day and rented our equip. from Boss Frog's next to Bad Ass Coffee just a short drive from the hotel. The hotel wanted around $9 for the day; Boss Frog's was $1.50.

We were in the central building facing the pool and ocean (an oceanview room) and that location was perfect. We could be at the pool w/o elevators in 60 seconds.

We swam w/ a huge sea turtle two days in a row! The resort itself is a beautiful setting and the pool is above average though not as awesome as the Westin next door. The deluxe oceanview room we stayed in was fine...clean...functional, etc. You ARE paying for the location, location, location staying at a resort like this. Don't expect a luxury suite for $350 a night like you'd get at home where you live. Do expect a beautiful facility, a very nice pool, a terrific beach, and a convenient location just 5 minutes from Lahainia to the South.

The resort was not overly crowded when we were there...but certainly there's a lot of people around the pool...don't be unrealistic...it IS a resort after all!

I am SPG Gold but no room upgrade - we booked Oceanview and got it. We were in building 4 and feel that - short of a suite - it's the best location in the resort. You're convenient to the pool and ocean, and a quick walk to the parking lot past the tennis courts. Thanks to an earlier reviewer for the tip that first day's valet is complimentary. Take advantage of it, particularly if you're just coming in from a Mainland flight. The room is unbelievably small. We didn't care because we weren't there much, but they are tiny! Greeting and check-in were great, Lei greetings and helpful staff. The room has an open fridge and, other than the obligatory $5 bottles of water, was free of high priced food traps. WiFi didn't work well but we could get a limited signal; room had a wired connection that worked about 75% of the time. We came here from Kauai, and immediately noticed the change in the staff and the guests - no eye contact and very little interaction that we didn't initiate. If you're from Southern California, you'll be very much at home here. If you talked to a fellow guest about where they were from, it was almost always Marin, Oakland, Orange, Riverside, or LA county. Ditto the other comments about guests getting up at the crack of dawn to secure a shaded pool chair. We were out at the pool around 9 or so and managed to find a spot but the choices were very limited after this. We knew better than to eat at the hotel's restuarants since no food was included in our package (we had a convertable car packaged with the room). Since our flight left late, we checked with Dollar about how much more we would have to pay for a couple hours that weren't included in the room package. First hour was $25 (acceptible), 61 minutes or longer less than a day is $76 plus all the airport charges (not acceptible). No budging on this, so we checked our bags early and traded Dollar for Hertz ($42 for 3 hours of a car, but just not giving any money to Dollar was worth it). We knew where the fitness center was, but it's tough to locate for new guests (2 or 3 elevator rides) and it is thankfully open 24 hours. The equipment is in bad need of repair and looks horrible. The elliptical machine's electronics and resistance didn't work at all. Hello Sheraton, if you're going to charge us a \"resort fee\" and tell us that it includes this, how about popping for some maintenance? As others have said, the Timeshare (\"Sheraton Vacations\") were located where you were forced to walk by their desk to go anywhere from building 4. Although they weren't obnoxious other than the fake smile and \"Aloha\" when you walk by, come on, Sheraton. Give us a break from this junk. There were two luaus going on both nights and we could see as much as any guest (more than we wanted to see) from our room. The Sheraton had always had a great fireworks show, and that was one of the reasons for staying there over the 4th (because of our past experience). We were disappointed to find that they discontinued this, starting this year. Lahaina had a great show that was visible after a walk down the beach. The coolest side trip we took was with Kahi Sindiong - he operates Ekahi Hawaiian Canoes at the end of the walkway (the other end of Kaanapali Beach away from the Sheraton). He charged us $50 a couple for to paddle along in an authentic Hawaiian outrigger racing canoe, complete with Hawaiian sea-turtles and great scenery. Find him if you can, you won't regret it. Best food on Maui is still Mama's Fish House. It's an hour ride from the Sheraton and worth every mile. They have lunch and dinner - we made it to one of each. There is a Roy's up the road to the left and in Kihei / Wailea that would be second choices to Mamas. Also great food and service at Ruth's Chris in Wailea, Good experience at Lelanis, so-so exeperience at Kimos in Lahaina, poor experience at Rusty Harpoon, and a bad experience at Bubba Gumps. Our flight was much later than the checkout, and the hotel offered us 1 pm checkout and access to the fitness center facilities after that (showers and towels are already there). No recognition of SPG Elite status. Bottom line, this is likely to be our final stay at The Sheraton Maui. Sad, because the property is in a great location and is well maintained. Fix the fitness center, train the staff, dump the Timeshare scum, and recognize your loyal guests.

This was absolutely the worst vacation experience we have ever had and that was purely the fault of the hotel staff.

After being scolded for asking to check in at 11:30 a.m. and being told firmly (not asked, told) that we would have to wait 3 1/2 hours to check in, we were phoned on the morning of our departure to see when we would be leaving because they needed the room for other guests.

The area around Black Rock was good for snorkeling, but be warned, there are about 30 or 40 or so people snorkeling with you during all times of the day. The pool area was also crowded. It was difficult to find shaded areas, and on the beach there was no shade; if you wanted a cabana shade you had to pay some crazy price for it.... leading up to my other complaint .... it was so pricey. Yes I know it's a fancy resort in Maui, but when I'm already paying hundreds of dollars to stay a night, I don't feel like I should pay $25 for breakfast or $38 for shade on the beach, or a $16 \"resort fee\".

Oh, and if you don't like Mexico because of the \"timeshare\" sellers, don't kid yourself....they do it at the Sheraton as well........", "Date": "May 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3467339", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Maui for 6 days in April and it was perfect. When we arrived we were greeted with leis and they immediately gave us a double upgrade without us having to ask. We had reserved a garden view room and ended up with an ocean view. The staff was attentive and courteous. Fellow guests were polite - rooms were nicely appointed and quiet - and the pools were beautiful. The location of the Sheraton is awesme - one of the best snorkeling locations on Maui is right off shore at Black Rock. And the torch lit walk to Whaler's Village and the other resorts is a beautiful backdrop for the impressive sunsets. We didn't try the restaurant, but the poolside grill/bar was good. The hotel has a very imprssive collection of koi - and when you walked alongside the pools they would follow you! The gym had cardio and universal equipment - but no freeweights that I remember - it did have showers though which was nice. The only 2 things I would critique are: 1. on some days, there were not enough lounge chairs by the pool, and guests tended to \"claim\" chairs with wet towels and sometimes not return to use them. 2. while self parking was easy (and free!) there were a limited number of spots in our lot and we returned from a luau at 11 one night to find it full.

The reviews here are mostly good and that's accurate. I had to register to post because I can't think of a single bad thing to say about the resort. The grounds and buildings are just beautiful, I've never stayed anywhere quite like it. Everything was wide open, there really are no \"doors\" anywhere, ohter than on the guest rooms. Breezes blew thru the lobby and all of the hallways. Even the elevator lobby areas were open to outside with beautiful tropical wicker type furniture. The grounds were paradise. The Sheraton really has a lot of land and is spread out...which we found to be a good thing. Walkways and tiki torches, greenery, flowers, palm trees, koi ponds, pools, waterfalls, lazy rivers...it all runs throughout the area. We walked down to the Westin one day to check it out...and while it is beautiful and the pools are something to see, we chose NOT to spend any time there. The buildings were darker and more closed off. They felt less tropical. Around every corner, Westin is trying to sell you on your next vacation with them in any and every state, plus they hit you up for timeshares. Also, the Westin is formed in a U-shape open to the ocean, so they are limited on space. Their pool area is crammed in and as one other poster noted, it's very LOUD at the Westin, with kids playing and waterfalls flowing. I know, this is not a Westin review, but I thought a comparison might be helpful to some. We went back \"home\" to the Sheraton fully glad it was the property we chose. We got a lei greeting upon arrival and dropped our bags off in our room. They had is in a room with 2 double beds, not what we requested. But, they said to check back in the morning. So, rather than unpack and settle, we headed out to the cabana by the pool for our first Mai Tai. Sure enough, first thing the next morning they moved us to a room on the 5th floor with a king/sweet sleep bed, with a partial ocean view. The rooms are very nice and well kept. The bathroom is large with plenty of counter space for toiletries. It's so nice to be able to set things out and leave them there. The bed and pillows were very comfy. The Sheraton is in the perfect location, it's beautiful with Black Rock right there and the snorkeling was great. It's also so nice to take the sidewalk path along the ocean to head to Whaler's Village and the restaurants down that way. Hula Grill, Lailani's, etc. Have some HULA PIE at Lailani's! Also as other reviews have posted, if you're looking for some good meals to save a buck or two, Castaways was great for breakfast. CJ's deli was good for lunch. Maui Taco's was tasty. Dinners were pricey so we tried to save some on other meals. The staff was friendly and helpful. Drinks the pool are pricey but good. We never had to hunt for a pool chair. And, we did get a late check out at 1PM the day we left, for no extra charge. I suppose it depends on who you talk to/work with for service...room upgrades or late check outs. But if one person tells you no, I'd say it wouldn't hurt to ask someone else an hour later!

We found the staff to be exceptionally helpful with anything. We had about 40 guests for our wedding and the desk staff helped with welcome bags for all . They were willing to help us in anyway. The staff constantly greeted us whenever they saw us. The bars at the pool were used alot by all of us and were great. Watch out for the Mai Tai'! Very good, still think about them! Had an outdoor massage the day of our wedding and it was wonderful. After our wedding festivities we went on our honeymoon to the island of Lanai and expected the same if not better service at the Manele Bay Hotel but it did not compare to the service at the Sheraton.

Unfortunately, it seems some things have changed in the last 2 years. We found the staff to be stand offish and not very helpful this time...the main difference is that they seem very stingy with everything. After booking us incorrectly in a double bed room instead of a king they had no other rooms available to make it right. Even given the inconvenience, they really didn't seem to care. On the last day, we requested to check out later. First, they told us it would be $50 to check out at 2:00 instead of 11:00 am and $150 if we wanted to stay until 4:00 (before it was only $50 to stay until 4:00). We agreed to stay until 2:00 and pay $50 and then the front desk told us that we could not do it, even if we paid...that we would have to leave no matter what. We worked it out and stayed until 2:00 but only after having to fight for extra time that we were paying for. The other disappointing thing was the crowds...we went at the same time of year last time and never saw the beach and pool so crowded. The last day there was not a single chair to sit in by the pool, unless you saved one by 8:00 am. We ventured over to Wailea and Makena and found those beaches MUCH less crowded (and great for bodysurfing and boogie boarding too!). Next time we return to Maui we will definitely stay on that side of the island. On a positive note, we tried The Feast at LeLe for the first time and LOVED it...better than Old Lahaina Luau in our opinion.

We stayed 5 nights from 4/12-4/17. We really enjoyed our stay here. We had a Garden view room which we booked through Costco. Our Garden View room was on the bottom floor so there wasn't much of a view but we still had a very large balacony and the price was right. We had no complaints with the room. We spent a lot of time at the bar overlooking the water, let me warn you the drinks are expensive. About $9 for a cocktail but the view is well worth the price. Be careful though because at $9 each the bill can add up fast We only ate at the hotel restaurant once for lunch and we had a salad and a sandwich but we enjoyed it.We had a good pork sandwich from the bar menu though. Other restaurants that we ate at that we would recommend were Kimo's in Lahainaa-this place has great fish selections and we have eaten here our last 2 stays and enjoyed it a lot. We also ate at Leilani's several times and we ate at there bar/grill menu, very reasonable and good food. We also ate at Hula Grill which was good and we also tried Sansei sushi in Kapulua. Sushi was good but our bill came to about $91 for 2 and I was not that impressed for the price. We eat a lot of sushi in California so we are kind of spoiled and not easily impressed. We tried the rusty Harpoon, also in the whalers village-we were not impressed at all and would not recommend it. Food was not goodm slow service and for the price you pay it is not worth it. Stick with the Hula Grill and Leilanis if your going to the Whalers Village. We did the Snorkel trip to Molikini for a second year in a row. We took the suggestion from the \"maui revealed\" book and went with the \"Four Winds 2\". Last year we went with the \"Pride of Maui\". I would not recommend the Four Winds-the boat trip to Molokini was very slow and it was a very bumpy ride. Lots of people getting motion sickness. We also got sick and we even took medicine. Last years trip on the \"Pride\" was much smoother and it's a larger boat. The crew seemed friendlier on the \"Pride of Maui\" and made you feel more welcome. Overall I would not take another trip to Molikini and would not recommend you go. If you are staying at the sheraton the snorkeling out front at Black Rock is far better than Molikini-trust me! You will see much more fish and more variety than you will on the snorkel trip. If you want to blow $80 a person on the trip you will have fun but there was very few fish and not much variety. The visibility is good but not much to look at. Save your money. You will really enjoy the snorkeling at the hotel. We saw a turtle the first day within the first 5 minutes we were in the water. Snorkel around the point and you will find more turtles, lots of fish, big schools of fish, lots of variety. This snorkeling is far better out front of the hotel than on the snorkel trip. We also played Golf at the Kaanapali Golf course, north course. I am not a very good golfer myself. My boyfriend and the other group we played with were not impressed with the greens.They all commented about the fact that they were in not that good of shape for the $130 price we paid.

We had a great room overlooking the pool, the beach and Black Rock where we could enjoy the Cliff Diving ceremony every evening right from our balcony. The snorkling right off Black Rock is one of the better places on Maui. We encountered not only many beautiful fish, but even giant Sea Turtles. The kids loved that!

Off-site, we rented gear for 4 of us for the week that was less than the daily charge right at the beach) The beauty was the location. Walk out of the room, through the exspansive Pool area, onto the beach and into the water. It's all right there. The staff at the Sheraton were great also.

Hope this helps your planning. You have to rent a car. We had a Sebring convertable with discounts paid $266/week, pretty reasonable. As you leave the airport you will drive by a K-Mart. Stop and buy an inexpensive styro. cooler, soda, bottled water etc. It will be a lot cheaper here than later. We wanted to go to the top of Haleakala for the sunrise the first morning. Being from WI. you will wake early. I woke up at 2:45am. The first night we stayed in a hotel in Kihei. It cuts off a lot of driving than starting from Kanapali. It was 1:45 from the base to reach the summit. An easy drive, the road is smooth and wide. The view and experience is second to none. It was truly a remarkable experience to see the sunrise over that crater. It was about 30 degrees which isn't bad for a midwesterner, but the wind was about 30 mph and the wind chill would freeze you to the bone so take warm clothes and gloves. The person taking the pictures without the gloves will suffer. That be me!! If you do anything in Maui this is a must! We then stayed at the Shereton in Kanapali. We had a oceanfront room that they upgraded to a deluxe. The room was spacious and comfortable and we were able to see whales right from our lanai. We had read some bad reviews about the rooms at the Shereton but the beds were very comfortable and we were pleased with our stay. Of course for the price you expect to be. When we arrived they gave ua a lai and had us sit down and relax while they loaded our luggage onto a golf cart for our transportation to our room. No formal check-in, very nice touch. We had read a lot about incidential charges that are aggrevating. Well, they do charge for chairs on the beach and they charge a $14.50/ day resort fee just like many other hotels. That's Hawaii, get over it or it will ruin your vacation. We snorkeled at Black Rock, right off the beach at the Shereton. We saw some pretty neat fish and four sea turtles which were neat but I would also recommend going to Molikini snorkeling if your serious about better snorkling. It is nice though to have that right off your beach. Whalers village is a short walk or drive to shopping and some dining. Get a nice hawaiian shirt at Tommy Bahama's. Expensive but very nice. Hey, it's your vacation! We had dinner one night at Swan Court in the Hyatt. The Hyatt was another hotel I thought would be very nice to stay at. Swan court is another must! The setting is second to none and the food is delicious. We ordered two appetisers and two salads and shared an entree. That way you can try a lot more dishes. They were very kind to bring our entree on two separate serving plates. (no extra charge) Service was great. Call for res. They open at 6:00pm. Go early and ask for a table by the water. If you like to dine, you will remember it for a long time. They validate your valet parking. Best dinner we had in Maui. Went on a helicopter ride with Blue Hawaiian. If you do this, this is probably the best. However, it was $400 for 45 minutes for two. Probably wouldn't do it again. The small thing that ticked me off was after the flight we had to pay $3 for parking at the heliport. You would think for $400 they would validate your parking. Again, you have to let those things slide. Took day trip south to Wailea and the south shore. A lot of nice beaches and sites and some good restaurants and shopping in the shops of Wailea. Also drove up to Iao Valley and the Maui plantation. Nothing great but nice to see. Went to the Old Lahaina Luau. My wife wanted to go more than I, but I really enjoyed it. You saw how they buried and roasted the pig; had a great variety of food; a great variety of tropical drinks, all included and good entertainment. Unless you like eating wallpaper paste stay away from the poi, no matter what anyone says, take my advise. I eat anything, but that stuff is nasty! If you go to a luau make sure you pay the price and go to this one. Others I have attended in the past for less were less! We also drove around the northern tip of Maui. I know it says no rentals beyond a certain point but it really is ok if you drive carefully. But it is at your own risk. Hey, if your one of those yahoo's that rode a bike down the volcano you certainly can do this. Make sure you have a good map with sites to see and milage markers or you will miss a lot. We went as far as Kahakuloa. There is a wonderful gallery there with very nice souveniers and a much needed bathroom. Prior to that you will see the stand with the \"best banana bread\". We concur, $5 for a mini loaf, a nice snack. You could take drinks and water in that cooler you bought at K-Mart earlier. You should always have liquids to drink. The views are much like off Hwy 1 in Ca. south of Big Sur. Very nice. Touring the golf courses in Kapalua are worthwhile. I would have loved to golf but my wife isn't a golfer so I spent my money in the pro shop! We took the road to Hana but were disappointed. We had high hopes because we love the outdoors and hiking but after taking that northern tip trip, the views just couldn't compare. Part of this was because there has been a bit of a drought and the waterfalls were just not that impressive. We bought the CD that describes the trip. It was probably worthwhile but the guy talks fast and I missed some because I was concentrating on my driving. It is a very winding road and I even was a bit motion sick at the end. I think its insanity to drive there and back in one day; especially when you have a property like the Hotel Hana Maui at the end. It's not a place for small kids because they would be bored but it is a wonderful relaxing property with a great spa and good food. We only stayed one night but wish we would have had two, so we could have enjoyed more. No clocks, TV's or phones; and really nothing else there, other than some nice spots you can drive to past Hana. But a couple of days of nothing but laying by the pool, a spa etc. would really put you in a good mood to travel back home. Especially if you were travelling to snow and 20 degrees. Leaving in the morning to go back to the airport is about 1:45 min. Most of the traffic is of course driving the other way to Hana. I could have written much more. We always left about two hours in the afternoons for pool or beach time in the sun. Wow, what a life. Someone ask me why I live in Wisconsin!. By the way gas is $2.66/gal, $3.16 in Hana. We bought a tank from the rental car co. at seven cents/gal below market and just went back with little gas in the tank. That way you don't have to worry about stopping at a station at the end.

The other 5 we were in Waikiki on Oahu. The Sheraton Maui is a WONDERFUl hotel. We were treated like royalty the moment we drove up. From the time we got into the parking lot, we never touched our bags until we were ready to leave. The resort is spread out and depending on where you are staying, there is some walking involved to get around. However you quickly develope \"routes\" in your head and can get around very easy. With such a large spread, the resort never seems crowded and the air is full of the flowery smells of Hawaii. We stayed in an ocenview room right on the black rock. It was great! The room is clean and comfortable. I have read reviews complaining about the matresses. I can't speak for all the rooms, but ours was like sleeping on a cloud. It was very comfortable. The resort has a prime location for swimming, snorkeling and scuba. It also is only a short walk up the beach to Whalers Village and many shops and places to eat. We found that the pool side bar does serve lunch and snacks but seemed expensive to us. $30 for hamburgers (no fries) and chocolate smoothies for 2. Neither of us drink very often so I cannot tell you what the alcohol prices were. Better off walking up the beach to the Hula Grill. The fruit sampler platter is awesome, as well as the other food. Very reasonable and a great view. We did break down and have lunch at the resort though, we just were enjoying laying around too much to head up the beach to the restaurants. The pool is also great. I read a poor review or 2 about it and do not know why. It is very large and lagoon type. You will spend alot more time in the ocean than the pool but the pool is great. You also have pool priveleges at the Westin Maui 2 hotesl down. They have a water slide and waterfall and a grotto type area. Very nice, but very kid friendly. If you are a family with children, they will like this pool a lot better. Honeymooners or older couples will like the Sheraton pool better. Contrary to another review, there IS a hot tub. You just need to look for it. You cannot swim to it. It is on the ocean view side , screened by plants and up a few stairs. Ask someone who works there to point it out if you can't find it. The pool area is very large, with many foot bridges crossing it. Walk around it and explore and you will find the tub on your own. One thing I cannot stress enough is to use the concierge service. They are GREAT. We planned virtually no activities until we got to the resort and did it all on the fly. The concierge got us great deals, directed us where to go and took care of all reservations. They simply bill the cost to your room, so you go to many of the activities, show ID and off you go. No paying and all that at the location, it is already done. We ate most of our meals in Lahaina and never ate in the regular restaurant at the resort so I cannot rate it. There is a Japanese restaurant called Tepanyaki Dan on the resort and we did eat there. It is excellent food and a lot of fun. We sat at a table with 2 other couples on their honeymoons and had a great time. If you have never eaten in a Japanese style restaurant before, just remember to allow yourself time. You are not in and out in 30 minutes. Also you will need to make reservations ahead of time to get in. It is popular and not very large. A bit pricy but worth it for the experiance and the special occassion. The only negative I have is that the hotel (and the one on Oahu) tends to nickel and dime you. The room we stayed in was not cheap on either island. You would think coffee would be included but if you make it in the room, or tea or hot chocolate, you will be charged. They also charge you for the use of the beach chairs, NOT the ones at the pool but the ones that you take onto the sand. For what you pay for the room, I would think that would cover chairs, but Hawaii is a bit on the pricey side. Just take a few extra towels from the kiosk by the pool and you will be fine. The staff is very friendly and we did not have a single problem with our stay. Tip: If you go up to Haliakala ( I know I spelled it wrong) to watch the sun rise dress WARM. It is COLD before the sun comes up. If you have the room in your luggage pack gloves (yes, gloves) a hat and a warm coat. We had brought light jackets with us. I wanted to bring coats but my wife thought I was crazy bringing stuff like that to Hawaii ( I saw people on tv wearing the stuff before we left home...but anyway) all we brought were jackets. We took the robes that the hotel provides with us and wore them over our t shirts and under our jackets when we got there and made due. We also took towels and draped them over our heads held on by our ball caps to keep our ears warm ( you are 10,000 feet up). In addition, bring a flashlight.

The Sheraton grounds are large as well, giving it a less crowded feel. We went down to the Westin to use their pool, but felt like everyone was jammed into a small space. The path that runs the length of the beach ends at the Sheraton, so there are not as many people criss-crossing in front of the hotel. The room was large enough, and well appointed. The beds were a little to soft and sagged in the middle, but were comfortable enough. Although you don't go to Hawaii to watch TV, the hotel should be embarrassed by the 19\" TV. The room also lacks any kind of internet service. The service at the Sheraton is spotty at best, indifferent at worst. We did have some pleasant experiences with certain staff, but overall it was pretty bad. For example, we sat at a table at the poolside bar for 30 mins without a waitress even addressing us. It's not the type of service that I would expect from a Sheraton or a resort in Hawaii. In the end, though, it really didn't matter.

We said fine. Next day, we were moved to a wonderful room on the second floor in building 4 that overlooked the entire beach and ocean. The front desk also gave us two free drink coupons to be used at the two bars located poolside, which we thought was very nice. Our new room was very convenient to pool and beach. We did not expect to be given such a nice room. I have read complaints about bathrooms w/ mold and tired worn furniture and beds but our room was none of those things. The bed was very comfortable. If you get building 4, the rooms closer to the beach are the nicest. Building 3 faces directly towards the beach but is set back about 100 yards.

You have to pay for the cabanas and lounge chairs on the beach. $30 for the cabanas and 15 for set of 2 lounge chairs on the beach. At least parking was included.

The good points was the hotel being a low rise, it did look a lot better than its high rise neighbours and also being close to Black Rock. Like others have mentioned, it was a bit of a maze to get from your room to the pool and whilst we are in our 30s was not too much of a problem but for older folks may be a bit much. The pool was beautiful and we really enjoyed swimming in it every day. The pool sunbeds though did leave a lot to be desired. A lot of the beds with the umbrellas were broken and all the beds were very gruppy. Plus they were all tied together so you couldn't move them and they were right next to each other. Another downside is many of the guests would leave the hotel towels on the beds from first thing in the morning and either wouldn't come back at all or returned at the end of the day. Very frustrating when there was such a lack of useable beds. We had booked a king ocean front and were upgraded to a 2 double bed ocean front room. Whilst a fine big room and bathroom, we did want the king size and plus it wasn't really necessary for us to have a second double bed. The room was tired but you can see the Sheraton are in the middle of renovation so hopefully this will improve in the future. We did have unusual odours in our hallway but the housekeeping sorted this out immediately. Another gripe we had was the daily $12.50 resort charge which covered free local calls, coffee sachets (two) provided in the room, daily local newspaper and free parking. Any hotels I have stayed in the past automatically provide all these services free of charge or as part of their room charge. Again, agree with our reviews that the service around the pool etc, was very poor and to try and get the attention of the waitresses was unbelievable even though you were sitting right near the bar. A few other guests also complained about this. For evening entertainment at the Sheraton, its an early affair and everything pretty much finishes by 10pm. Whalers Village isn't too bad but apart from the three restaurants and shops, does not offer much else. We used to head to Lahaina each night (about $10 in a cab) which had much more to offer. Nearly all the restaurants we ate at were of a good standard but nothing outstanding. Being from Ireland/UK, we were disappointed that there were no bars or pubs and to have just a drink, you had to use the bars in the restaurants which wasn't exactly our cup of tea. The best one for just a drink was the Hardrock Cafe. Would definitely recommend the Helicopter trips. We did ours with Sunshine Helicopters and booked it through Tom Bareback Cashback Tours in Lahania (about the only operator that doesn't try and sell you a timeshare!). We did the Hana Highway Express trip but after doing the helicopter ride, it was a bit of a let down. For breakfast, we continued past Black Rock and up to a cafe bar called the Castaway which was recommended to us by a local and definitely did great food. Plus a fraction of the price compared to Sheraton's breakfast. Whalers Village has an ABC store so stock up on your water, etc from there as the hotel will charge $5 for a bottle of water. Also, there is a 24 hour Safeway in Lahaina. Even though we had a good time ourselves and the beaches, etc were fabulous. I definitely would not be returning to the Sheraton or Ka'annapli as its a bit too touristy/commercial for me.

We stayed at the Sheraton Maui and had a wonderful time. After a day of flying from Wisconsin to Hawaii we arrived at the hotel in our rental vehicle (a must have in Maui) at about 8:00 pm. We were greeted by a very welcoming staff. When booking our honeymoon through a travel agent we only booked a garden view room, but per the advice of our travel agent we asked about the possibility of an upgrade upon our arrival. The front desk stated the hotel was booked the first 2 nights but said we could be upgraded to an ocean front room for the remaining days of our stay. Our 1st floor garden view room was nice and the hotel had a bottle of champagne waiting for us too. It has a lanai/patio and was next to the croquet lawn. We got the culture/sticker shock of Hawaii when we just wanted some water and ordered 2 bottles of it from room service and it was over $11.00 (we found a pop machine down along the beach walkway that had bottled water at a great price, so we stocked up!) Also - be wary about having your lanai door open because we did find a cockroach in our room. I called the front desk and they apologized but advised those are common in the islands. The next day while we were out the hotel transfered our bags to our new room and we were set in a room with a spectacular ocean view and large bathroom (and no cockroaches!). When we were booking our honeymoon we were debating on whether or not to include the breakfast buffet in the package. We didn't, and although we did eat at it one morning and it was very good I am glad we didn't pay the extra money to have it included. Activities start rather early in Maui because by noon time it is very hot. We were usually on the road to an activity and wouldn't have had time to eat the buffet anyway. We booked our activities through the concierge desk at the Sheraton, and I wish I could remember his name because he was great! He was so helpful and helped us decide on what we wanted to do and then made the calls to arrange everything. He had great advice, especially when we were debating between options because he had done practically all of the activities so he gave us first hand advice. Things we did: *Haleakala (since we were off on the time difference it was perfect opportunity to get up VERY early and drive to the top to watch the sunrise on our first morning. There are biking tours, but we choose to drive ourselves since we had the vehicle). *Luau at the Hyatt Regency. Highly recommend it because it is Hawaii! Also nice because you can just walk down the beach to it. *Snuba & Snorkeling, through Aqua Adventures. Would definitely recommend them over the large boats that take alot of people. The crew with Aqua Adventures were great! I was nervous to Snuba but they helped me and they got to know everybody by their first names. It is a smaller boat (about 20 or so people) so you get great service. *Road to Hana, Beautiful sites! but very curvy road, but very glad we did it. Don't forget to stop and fill up with gas, buy snacks because there are no stores along the way. We also bought the Hana CD that was being sold at a stand next to a gas station and it was helpful. You play it while driving Hana and it points out things we would have missed (you also get a styrofoam cooler w/ ice too.) *Dinner cruise aboard the Teralani 2. This was great! Relaxing dinner and drinks on a boat that was casual. Can't wait to do it again. *4-wheeler adventer ride on Haleakala (then walked over the vineyard next door!) *Surf lesson. Was great fun! The Sheraton has the best beach along the stretch of Ka'annapli. The other hotels seemed very nice too (Westin, Hyatt, etc) but the beach was the biggest at the Sheraton. The Sheraton is spread out with lots of garden and walk ways/grass areas but it does not take but minutes to walk the area. The bartenders were very nice and made great cocktails. The pool area was also very nice and had many chairs spread out around it (in contrast to the other hotels where they had many chairs but were practically on top of eachother). My husband went for a quick swim while I was finishing packing and he said he say something floating in the water, but who knows. Whalers Village is also right down the beach bath and has a couple restaurants and a variety of shops. (We ate at Lelani's and can't wait to go back) All in all we had a great honeymoon and can not wait to go back to Hawaii. We truly enjoyed our time at the Sheraton but there are so many nice hotels in Maui that we may try something new.", "Date": "September 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Redondo Beach, CA", "Title": "\u201cA very nice and relaxing environment...\u201d", "Author": "drumeister", "ReviewID": "UR2581855", "Content": "We just returned from a 6 day stay (9/9 to 9/14) and have to say overall were very impressed with the hotel. My wife and I (no kids) went just to get away from the grind at home and relax and that is exactly what the Sheraton is good for. After reading all the reviews on this webpage, I was a little concerned about certain things but am now very pleased that I overlooked these and came here anyway. Highlites: Upon check in, we were greeted with nice leis and walked right up to registration with no lines. We had booked a partial O/V room, but were immediately upgraded to an O/Front room on the top floor of building 3 (6th floor). The view was very nice although blocked by alot of palm trees (we are in Hawaii, right?), but you could see the grounds, the ocean, and the island of Lanai across the water. The balcony was very small which was a drag as my wife and I like to sit out in the morning with our coffee and enjoy the view. It was hardly big enough for both of us to be out there at the same time! I was told the lower the floor, the bigger the balcony so being at the top I guess that is what we sacrificed. My only other complaint about the room was the size of the bathroom, it was tiny. I could not imagine having a whole family trying to use this let alone just the 2 of us. The room was very clean though and all the fixtures and furniture seemed to be in good shape. We did not have the A/C noise problem that I have read about in several reviews, we slept well. The beds are comfortable but the pillows were not nice to sleep on. If you like a firm pillow, you may want to bring your own, these were so soft it felt like there was nothing there. Overall, the resort was very uncrowded, we found out that they were at 60-65% capacity which was great for us. No offense, but when I go on vacation the last thing I want is a crowded environment or a bunch of kids running around and screaming. It was quiet, mellow, and allowed us to really relax. I don't think I have ever been to a resort that size that was so peaceful! I kept waiting for the traditional party animals to break out in the pool in the afternoon (which usually happens at most resorts) but it never did. The pool was awesome, a large deep 8' pool to swim laps in (if you like) that turns into a floating canal of a river that winds through the property lined by lava rock and waterfalls. My only complaint would be that they need a pool bar of some kind as you have to get out of the pool every time you want a drink and go stand with the people eating their lunches to get a drink. Drink prices are way high, $8-10 a drink. Suggestion for those who like a strong drink: order the \"old style mai tai\". You will only need one or two of these and you are good to go for the day, wow! Also, the hours of operation of the bars are strange: there are 2 poolside bars and they are both closed by 8pm (one closes at 3pm) with an inside bar closing at 10pm, nowhere to go for a late night drink if you want to wander. You can take the 10 minute walk down to Whalers Village if you want to continue your party or a 5 minute cab ride into La Haina where there are plenty of bars and clubs. Back to the pool..if you lay by the pool the chairs are free and there were plenty of chairs every day we were there, we never had to go without. If you wanted a prime spot (like by the waterfalls) you did have to go down early and claim your spot but it was easy to do. As for the beach chairs, I had a real problem with having to \"rent\" these. These should be an a first come, first served basis. Paying $30 a day to sit in a chair is outrageous and I could not justify doing it. Sit by the pool for free and walk onto the beach, it is right there! Also be prepared to rent snorkel, fins, mask, rafts, and anything else you want to use in the pool or ocean, none of it is included. I brought my own mask and snorkel and figure I saved myself $75 by weeks end! You will want to snorkel at Black rock and I believe it is one of the best spots on the island to snorkel, and it is right there in front of the hotel! I took a day and went to 2 other places around the island that were recommended to me as the \"best\" spots and I was disappointed with both as they were not clear and the variety of fish was nowhere as good. At Black rock I swam with Sea turtles, Eagle Rays and dozens of other varieties of tropical fish. I went out at least once a day and was never disappointed. The sunset ceremony each night was a nice touch and a great way to end the day. With acoustic live music and a torch carrier that runs through the resort and up onto the cliffs, lights the torches for the evening right as the sun is setting, then dives into the water was great. We went every night we could and saw some incredible sunsets. As for food, we had the breakfast buffet a couple times and most of it was real good. The omelette bar was great and all the frest fruit and juices were nice. The preheated remainders were a typical buffet type of food. We did have dinner one night in the main restaurant and had a very nice prime rib dinner, and I also experienced an amazing coconut shrimp dinner via room service. Overall, the food was very well presented and very tasty. The staff were great. They were always super friendly, corteous, and always greeted us with a smile and asked if there was anything they could do to make our stay more pleasant. This went on throughout the entire week, we did not have one unfriendly situation. Lastly, if you are going, 2 recommendations: The sunset cocktail cruise on the Terelani 65' Catamaran was a definite highlight of the trip. Drinks, food and a cruise off the coast on a beautiful boat was a perfect end to one of our evenings and last, If you are a scuba diver, I did several dives with LaHaina Divers. It was a great experience, the crew was nice and helpful, the boats were clean, plenty of room and the gear was all up to date. I have been out with many dive companies and these guys were one of the best.

The beach is beautiful and there is good snorkeling at \"black rock\" in front of the hotel. The views are awesome from many of the rooms.

The whole family received a nice lei from the parking valet. We checked in at the valet's desk and were immediately whisked to our room. Valet parking is free the first night. After that, you either self-park for free or pay $5 a day for valet. We were automatically upgraded to a \"junior\" suite. It was very nice. Being on the ground floor on the ocean side, it was very convenient to the pool and beach, but didn't have much of a view. We asked the valet to have a roll-away bed and crib brought to the room, and when we got back from dinner, both were in place as promised. The room itself had a nice \"living\" area with a couch, chair, coffee table, entertainment center, and a good-sized TV. Off to the side was a kitchenette with sink, refrigerator and microwave. We put these to use and saved some money on breakfasts and lunches. The living area was separated from the bedroom by a solid-core door. The bedroom was large, with a king size bed and plenty of space besides. There was another smaller TV in the bedroom. The bathroom was off of the bedroom and was fairly large. Our first-floor room was obviously meant to qualify as a handicapped room, because handrails were everywhere in the bathroom. The single sink was also the kind one could roll a wheelchair under. This was not as nice as a cabinet would have been, but understandable under the circumstances. The room was quite clean, the furnishings were up-to-date, and all the finishes were in good condition. A few very minor complaints: we were next to the self-service guest laundry and we sometimes heard the quarters dropping into the machines, the bedroom AC rattled sometimes, and I never figured out some of the light switches. The grounds were spacious and beautiful. Large open areas made for a relaxing feel. We all loved the big winding pool - we couldn't tear our three-year-old away from the little slide the entire week. The location near black rock is ideal. The snorkeling is good near the rock - we saw sea turtles, manta rays, and the usual tropical fish. The kids loved the koi fish ponds near the restaurants. Ask a waiter for fish food around 9:45 AM. The live music after 4 PM was very nice. I really enjoyed lazily floating in the pool's waterways, looking at the gorgeous scenery, and listening to the music. The food at the restaurants was generally good, but not great. Some of the hot items on the breakfast buffet were quite dry. The teppan-yaki place was fun, but most of the food tasted the same. The angus beef burger on the lunchtime grill menu was actually very good. Prices are high, but not too over-the-top when compared to the rest of the island. All the staff members were very helpful and polite. The beach concierge staff at the kiosk were kind and efficient. The front desk staff arranged for a very late checkout since we had a red-eye flight home. I agree that the Sheraton should just roll the \"resort\" fee into the price of the room. Calling it out as a separate line item makes me look for the specific ways it is applied. The only thing it really seems to get you is the daily paper (all ten or so pages of it). They try to say it gives you the right to park your car yourself (uh, thanks?) and have a safe in your room (yawn). If they just increased the price of the room by $15 bucks it would leave a better feeling.

The crowds are a real contrast to our November and early June visits to the island. But back to the Sheraton - additional plusses are the excellent housekeeping service, the small refrigerator in the room, and easy self-parking. The two major downsides are the quality of the in-hotel restaurant (high prices with surprisingly bad food) and the ridiculous $15/day fee for \"free parking, local calls, and newspapers.\" In addition to the already high room prices, a rollaway cot would have cost us another $50/night. There are other excellent values in the area that I would use next time, giving up mainly the Sheraton's fun pool system. If you have cash to burn, make a reservation at Roy's Restaurant - wonderful! If you're on a budget, check out Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina - absolutely the best local food and service! The only other comment I'd like to make is to remind visitors to respect the culture of the islands - I saw too many instances of rude mainlanders, demanding hotel guests, and fast drivers, all acting like Ugly Americans.

During our stay, we checked out every property on Kaanapali and the Sheraton fit our needs best. That's not to say that the other properties weren't nice or didn't have their merits, just that the Sheraton seemed to offer the best mix. It is a beautiful facility with outstanding location; more then that however, the Sheraton, unlike the Westin in particular, had the right mix of things going on without the overwhelming intensity and feeling of crowdedness that plagued the Westin. Getting a pool chair at the Westin was like going to war. Doing likewise at the Sheraton (a better overall pool, minus the Westin's thrilling waterslide...a must do!!!) was easy to do until late into the morning. The rooms at the Sheraton are nice enough, although we were only in ours to sleep and shower. The bathrooms had a large amount of space. The beds were decent and the decor was passable, if just a little dated. The only real issues we encountered were a toilet that was almost impossible to flush and a widely malfunctioning safe. The on-site food ranged from decent to good. The breakfast buffet was quite tasty and relatively affordable since the kids eat free with a paying adult. We ate dinner one night at Teppan Yaki Dan, which featured much better food then I expected (although my wife was hit by a flying piece of hot lobster...a casuality we overcame with the Sheraton picking up the cleaning bill) Other highlights included outstanding snorkeling every morning off Black Rock (we saw countless fish, nearly a dozen sea turtles, an eel something that looked like a barracuda and a manta ray..but sadly, no sharks) My recommendation is to go early in the morning (we went at 6:00am) and swim completely around Black Rock for the best encounters. The concierge was very helpful and the pool and snorkel rentals very good as well. My only real beef with the Sheraton was the meager facility it tries to pass off as a workout room.

The pool was great and unlike the Hyatt or Westin we didn't have to wake up at 6:00 AM to claim our chairs. My kids had a plast swimming down the laggoons and jumping off waterfalls. The pool service was perfect and we didn't have to fight for a waitor. The beach is the best in Kaanapali. The beach is literally huge and the hotel rents lounges on the beach. They also provide the pool service for those who rent beach lounges. It really shows why the hotel and beach were on the Travel Channel for best beach service hotels in Hawaii. At the hotel you can rent snorkel gear to snorkel at Black Rock right in front of the hotel. It was an amazing experience and there were swarms of fish. You can'y do this at the beaches in front of the Westin, Marriott, or Hyatt. Also my sister-in-law who was staying at the Fairamont visited us at the Sheraton and said she is staying here from now on. The hotel only is four stories and its private location at the north end of the beach makes it feel more secluded than other hotels that are 6 stories and crammed in.

After reading through the Sheraton's satisfaction guarantee, we decided to ask for an upgraded room. We were met with a bit of opposition and told an upgrade might not be possible due to overbooking. After much debate, we got our way, and we moved the following day to the 6th floor, directly above our previous room. The hotel clerk assured us that it was a much, much nicer room. Well if losing about 25% of the previous room's size and 75% of the balcony meant nicer, than I guess that's what we got! I called the front desk again and they transferred me to the manager (which in all honesty, I don't believe I was speaking to the manager). I was told that our \"upgrade\" was the view and that the actual rooms got smaller the higher the level of the building. The view was much better, but it still wasn't what we wanted. So, I asked for a suite and I was told they were all sold out and there was nothing else they could do. Some satisfaction guarantee huh? lol Also of note. The rooms themselves were not very clean. Our bathroom in both rooms were filthy. The light fixtures literally had a coating of dust on them. The pillows on the beds are more or less worthless. They are like sleeping on pieces of paper with the way they disperse when you lay on them. Maybe we were being a bit to picky, but when you're on your honeymoon, you want it to be absoultely perfect. Oh well, you live and you learn. The beach and water is very nice though. Perfect for snorkeling and scuba diving.

The beach was unbelievably beautiful and the snorkeling around the black rock right outside the hotel was decent. The pool was also very nice, but a lot of times it was impossible to get a chair. The set up of the hotel is a bit wacky and definately takes some getting used to, but our room was kept clean and stocked. Expect to pay for anything you want to do. It doesn't seem like anything was included in the resort fee. Overall we had a wonderful time. It would be hard to ruin such a beautiful place.

Beautiful grounds, friendly service and the best beach in Kannapali. Spent 1 week of our honeymoon in Feb and it could not have been better. Snorkeling right in front of black rock was better than the 2 snorkeling trips I paid to go on. Crystal clear water and a ton of tropical fish. Even saw a sea turtle. The resort charges you a 15 dollar a day resort fee for newspaper, coffee and parking. Beach chair rental on the beach was 2 chairs for 15 daily. The pool area was great. Many spots to choose from along the pool area. The food at the hotel was very good but priced just like any other hotel in the world..HIGH. Take the 5 minute drive to Lahina and have your pick of many fine restaurants and shops. Take a day trip down to Big Beach past Wailea was the best beach I ever saw. Clear Blue water and white sand beach surrounded by mountains. Barely anybody else there.

We checked in on Valentines Day and were very happy to find out that out partial ocean view room was upgraded to a deluxe ocean view on the ground floor of building 6 which was on the back side of the black rock. (3 elevators to get to the beach from buildings 5 and 6 but probably only 300 steps to get to the beach. I didn't think it was that bad. It was quiet with private parking.) Every morning we would watch the whales from our lanai and feed the birds. The grounds are beautiful, the beach is one of the best I've seen at a hotel in Hawaii, and the pool is fun. It meanders through the grounds of the hotel with a hot tub and a kiddy slide. The hotel staff has the \"aloha\" down. They are very nice and helpful. I also met several guests there that were willing to be social, it was a very friendly environment where people just went to relax. The Torch Lighting Ceremony was fun. Drinks at the pool bars are half price during the day making it almost affordable. It seemed like one pool bar had half price from 1:00-3:30 and then the other pool bar had half price for a couple hours after 3:30. The hotel was one of the first built in the area. Our room was clean and updated but the fixtures were original, which was fine. For restaurants, we went to Kimo?s. It was good but I've had better. I thought the portion of fish was small. It was one of the most popular restaurants for diner. Reservations recommended or expect to wait after 5:30. Longhi's was ok. The clams and fish were a little fishy tasting. Both are expensive. If you want a cheep breakfast & dinner & early bird specials, McGillacudy's, upstairs across the street from Kimo's. I liked Cheeseburger in Paradise also, nice view, & evening entertainment. We also liked Giovanni's, on the left as you turn towards the Sheraton off the main road. We like their pizza. If you are willing to drive a about 40 minutes, Joe's in Wailea is expensive $20-32 a plate but has great seafood. I generally don't like the Wailea area, too snobby, but Joe's is great. The Lahaina area is much nicer, friendly, relaxing. I like shopping along the ocean-side boardwalk. Other things to do, we took a day trip to Molokai, taking the ferry in the morning, renting a car there, (Try to get one through Budget if you can. The one we were given through an agency other than Budget had about 75,000 on it. It was basically an island bomb but it got us where we needed to go.) driving seeing the island, and taking the 2pm ferry back. It was nice, the people were friendly and we had huge beautiful beaches to ourselves. We took the Fair Winds II to Molikini. It was a fun trip; we saw LOTS of whales and the captain had a really funny personality. It was one of the bigger, seemed less crowded boat going there. For driving, we liked the road to Hana, several waterfalls, red sand (Koki Beach) & black sand beaches. It will take you about 3 hours to get to the Sacred Pools though. The road is a small 2 lane, most bridges are 1 lane. People drive slow and are courteous. The road north of Lahaina going through Honokowai is more dangerous, few guardrails, one lane portions that are mountain on one side and cliff on the other. The road is paved but it is a little unnerving especially when meeting other cars.

Our room was spectacular, with a beautiful ocean view, and was easily twice the size of the typical hotel room. (We paid for ocean view and may have been upgraded.) Check in was seemless, with the bellman meeting us at our car and taking us directly to our room. Service throughout our stay was friendly and attentive. This hotel is one of the oldest in Maui, but was completely renovated in recent years and the public areas, while not plush, are definitely worthy of a five star resort. In my opinion, the hotel has one of the best locations on the beach - at the quiet end with Black Rock, but within easy walking distance of Whaler's Village, the Westin, the Hyatt, etc. Its pools, while beautiful, are not as elaborate of those of its sister property the Westin. Thus, there are fewer families with children at the Sheraton. However, guests of the Sheraton have full access to the facilities at the Westin and other Starwood properties on Maui.

We bid this on Priceline one month prior and ended up getting it for the rate that seems to be pretty common for it. We were getting married on Maui and were hoping to get a nice room for the stay. My fiance' called ahead and added her Starwood card number to the reservation with the hope of getting some priority but was not too optimistic based on the tone of the girl on the other end. When we checked in, the place was nearly full (Valentine's Day weekend and President's Day weekend) so we were given a garden view room on the second floor of building two facing the tennis courts and a double bed but were told that if we called them Saturday morning (our wedding day), we could probably be accommodated for an upgrade. We weren't overly optimistic since it was Valentine's day and we figured the rooms would probably be packed by then too. We were wrong. We got back late in the day after our wedding festivities concluded and we were upgraded to a magnificent ocean view room suite in the building on top of Black Rock, overlooking the ocean, the entire resort grounds and all of Kaanapali. The room had a private entry shared with one other, much smaller room and ours was about 1500+ square feet with a patio that was close to the size of the entire room we were just upgraded from. They brought up a complimentary bottle of champagne and we relaxed in the room for the remainder of the evening. The most amazing room I'd ever stayed in; easily a $1000/night plus room. All in all, the first two nights we probably could have pushed for a better room if we had wanted but the last night completely made up for it. The staff was extremely helpful and kind once we arrived, the grounds were immaculate and there are numerous things to do on site or by walking down to Whaler's Village (shops and restaurants) about 5-10 minutes down the pathway.

It really ruined the vacation. The lobby was not all that impressive. When we got to our room is smell like urine and there was no lanai as promissed. We did not even let the bell hop leave and called the front desk. I was told that there were no more rooms in my category and that we would have to stay there. I told them that this was unacceptable to either find another room or upgrade me. After 20 minutes the front desk called back and said that the found another room. We went to our room and it felt damp but my wife and I said we would try it. The veiw was of the tennis courts, garbage bins and golf course. I must say though that the beach was magnificent. Although you had to pay 15 dollars a day per person for a lounge chair. That was outragoeous, so we went to the local ABC store and purchased a beach mat. The worst was yet to come, our room was infested by roaches. My wife and I were horrified. We had the creeps staying in that room. We decided not to switch rooms because we did not want to spend a few hours of our precious time packing and unpacking. When I went to see management about it they took a very cavalier attitude about it and suggested that they were some other bugs and not roaches. The nerve. The only thing they offered me was a refund on my $12.50 resort fee for the days that I spent there. I did not feel that this was right. I spent Thousands Going to this supposed First Class hotel and accept for the natural surroundings it could have been any roadside motor lodge. When I came home I wrote a letter to the General Manager and after 2 months got a reply. They gave me 10,000 Starwood points which would not even cover a night in this hotel or other first class starwood properties. My Vacation was ruined. I would not recomend this hotel at all.
