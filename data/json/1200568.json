Hotel location is good. Mall of the Emirates is on the other side of road and is about 5 mins walk. Front desk staff (Ms. Yogita) was very nice n helpful but the hotel itself is not up to the mark. To start with hotel room is too small with no mini bar. There is just a hand wash liquid in bathroom on the name of bathroom amenities which has to be used both for bathing n washing hands. Size of the bathroom itself is too small. No tissue was provided in bathroom. Very limited choice of channels on TV and most of the available channels are in Arabic. While checking in it was told that common PC (2 nos) in lobby can be used for free for accessing the internet but the next day, it was told to us to buy internet pack. Price of the room service was exorbitantly high, may be more than a 5 star hotel. One bottle of water, which is AED1.5 in market they are charging AED 15 and it took 30 mins to get the water in room. There is neither any bathrobe, nor any sleepers or tea coffee making facility in the room. All in all it seems more like a hotel with 2 star facilities at the price of 4 star.

In other circumstances, it could be a 4 out of 5. Bad luck means: connecting door to a room with very noisy people. As others have said, it's a very clean hotel, if very basic. Too basic even for a Ibis. But it's worth the price. Maybe a bargain in a expensive city. Close to the Mall of the Emirates (5 minutes walk), which has a metro station and a lot of shops and eateries. But in the hotel's street there are a couple of grocery stores and some turkish restaurants. Room is small, but I think it's not tiny. (I was travelling solo.) Air conditioning works well. Bathroom is, as in others Ibis, basic: a small shower and a washbasin. TV has a fair selection of channels. Windows don't open. There is a paying wired internet access in the room, but the lobby is a free wi-fi hotspot (ask the front desk for the free password). Staff is helpful and polite, but not extremely attentive. Correct in all cases. I took the buffet breakfast, and was generous in the line of a 2 or 3-star hotel. Staff was slow cleaning the tables and preparing them for the next customer. My bad luck: there is a mosque near the hotel, that calls muslims around 5am. And my room had a connecting door to a room with several people that started praying loudly after the mosque call. So, while the room was more or less quiet (some traffic because it was in front of elevators), this 'middle-of-the-night' religious thing broke my rest. Maybe walls isolate sound well, but it's not the case of doors. After visiting other Ibis around the world, this one looks too basic: no paper nor pencil to take notes; no bathroom extras as a solid soap, a little hand towel or a shower cap; towels looked very, very reused (I didn't expect a fluffy, egyptian cotton towel, but not either an overlaundered one.) Fixes: renew the towels, add some extras to the room (at least paper and pencil) and expedite cleaning during breakfast. In any case, I recommend this hotel, not just because it's cheap but because it have a good level in its category.

I was only expecting a continental breakfast since we only paid \u00a346 for the room per night however the breakfast range and quality was fantastic. The area was really nice (opposite from the Burj Al Arab) and also close to the public beach. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here if you want a cheap but nice hotel in a good part of town. We also arrived at 8am in the morning and the hotel staff were great and had our room ready. There are also lots of taxis outside this hotel so it is not difficult to flag down taxis.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for clean, large rooms and fantastic service\u201d", "Author": "TLTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR116876044", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights, the rooms were clean and large enough to our liking.

We found that quite impressive, and just gave that extra personal touch. As for the hotel itself, the room we had was very standard, aircon, tv, phone etc, but it didnt have a bar fridge which we missed, but there were ice buckets available down the corridor which we made very good use of. It takes about 5minutes to walk to the Mall of Emirates, and from there you can also access the Metro, or walk straight to the Metro from the hotel, which takes less than 10minutes. There were also always taxis waiting outside the hotel, so that too was great. We had standard breakfast included, and that had a range from cereal to scrambled eggs to different cheeses and coffees etc, well worth it. We would definately stay there again, and recommend it to anyone wanting to pay a good price and be close to a mall or metro line when in Dubai.

Calling the Manager on duty made it ever worse! It looks he never hear of something called 'Customer Satisfaction'! He told me it is available at the lobby. It was extremely difficult for me to run downstairs with my laptop and lots of confidential papers to do my work. 2. Then, we were surprise when we found no refrigerator ant any of the 3 rooms we have occupied! We told: \"This is a hotel standard\"!? Room refrigerator is one of essential piece of furniture, especially in hot countries when people require refreshments more than they need them on cold weather areas. 3. There were no paper tissue boxes in rooms! When I called talked to the manager on duty, she told me: 'This is a hotel standard'!? Usually, this is not only a service to customers; it is rather a service to the hotels around the World in order to prevent occupants from spitting on their carpets or use beds' sheets to clean their noses! So, it is for the benefit of the hotel more that it is for the occupants.

The Ibis is also reasonably priced, clean and interestingly decorated. Staff were average friendly. However, on the negative side, there was no safe in the room which always makes me feel insecure because one has to hide valuables, carry them or entrust them to the hotel safe. Also there was an unpleasant charge for the internet and it was rather difficult to access especially if you don't have a laptop and use the hotel machine. The bed was hard. And use of the shower could flood the entire bathroom because the shower cubicle was only half covered, water did not drain away fast enough and there was only a small rise in the floor to separate shower from bathroom. To overcome this problem, I had to take off the drain cover so water could drain faster. In any case, the spray nozzle beside the toilet leaked anyway, flooded the floor and caused me wet feet whenever I visited the loo.

Enquired abt the internet charges for 1 hr & 12 hr packages. Asked for clarification from the friendly receptionist if we purchased the 12hr internet package, is it a consecutive connection (one-time login) or can we use it over the period of stay by logging in/out? We were told that we could log in and out as long as the total usage was within 12 hours, over several days. When we got into the room, we signed up for the internet 12 hour package online. We logged in once, and logged out after 1 hour. Little did we know that we would not get to use the internet again becos even thou we had logged out, it was a consecutive connection. One day later, we tried to login to the internet and realised we couldn't. Called the front desk and was rudely told that internet packages differ when purchased from the reception, and when you select to activate the internet from your room. Apparently, internet packages purchased from reception will allow you to login and out over several days as long as the total usage is not exceeded. Whereas the internet package from the room online is consecutive. We informed the Manager who was now referred to calm us down that this was not stated anywhere (not even in the T&C in the login page, or at the front desk, and the receptionist certainly did not inform us of such a difference). The Manager was adamant that this was our own fault. We then asked for a copy of the T&C as it was stated on the online login that a copy could be obtained from the hotel. The Manager then told us that he does not have a copy of the T&C. The Manager then offered us a 1 hr complimentary internet coupon because we were already on the phone for 15mins with this dispute and it felt like he just wanted to get us to shut up. This was extremely upsetting as we had to pay for the 12 hr package thinking it would allow us to use it over several days. And further damage was done when the manager simply told us that it was our own fault. We were on the phone trying to dispute that this was no where clearly stated for 15 mins. The manager then sent up a lady staff to our room to pass us the 1 hour complimentary voucher. I opened the door and the lady staff simply glared at me and rudely shoved the voucher into my hands when I opened the door. We were so upset by the whole incident that we didn't use the 1hr complimentary voucher and we were still forced to pay for the 12 hr package upon checkout. We gave them back the 1hr complimentary voucher by the front desk just shrugged their shoulders and told us it doesn't matter to them whether we used it or not. Other than the upsetting incident with the internet and management, the room is clean but no-frills. There is no safe in the room, no fridge, no bar. Forget about hoping for any toiletries (no toothbrush, no bars of soap) as there was none. There is a liquid soap dispenser attached to the wall, and a shampoo dispenser in the shower, also attached to the wall. The hotel is within 10 mins walking distance to the Mall of the Emirates which is pretty good. Overall, the ibis brand name is good as the hotel was well-maintained and clean. The service staff needs to go through customer service training again, including the Manager. We have travelled around the world and have not been treated so curtly and rudely. Would have expected better behaviour from a staff of the management. And the incident spoilt our whole trip. I would not stay at this hotel again unless the staff improves their attitude and I would not recommend others to stay here either.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201cSleep well for its value for money\u201d", "Author": "oscar28", "ReviewID": "UR57589377", "Content": "This hotel is more like an up-market student hostel rather than a hotel, I spent 5 days and found it reasonable for the price as it is in quite a good and quiet location. The hotel is in a high rise block walking distance from the mall of the Emirates (the one with the ski slope). The beauty of its location is that it is also close to the metro/subway station on the brand new Dubai metro line so you can go to other places without fighting the infamous traffic jams of Dubai. The hotel staff are helpful and efficient at check-in and check-out but don't expect much more, it is only listed as a two start hotel. The common areas have nice modern decor and furnishing in a reasonable condition given that it is less than one year old. The rooms are average size suitable for one person and a couple would find it cramp, especially the small bath room. Each room has usual shelf, bench table and a non-opening window which blocks the noise from main streets where busy traffic can be seen or heard. The bathroom is small but without any accessories and fittings for but the shower works well. No tea making facility in the room and also NO free broadband internet so go to Starbucks at the mall if you are desperate for either. Breakfast was OK in the ground floor restaurant but I only eat once there. The hotel is a bargain for business men who needs a room at last minute because prices are standard and it seems static compared to other hotels which raise prices for late bookings or event bookings. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and I will come back for winter stays.
