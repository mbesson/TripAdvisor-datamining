{"Reviews": [{"Content": "In desperate need of refurbishment. We booked for a 3 night stay, but left after the first night. The furnishings were outdated, the room smelled musty, and the doors/ windows had large gaps which would let mosquitoes and other insects in.The worst was the bathroom, which had mould all over the tiles, basin and even the towels. Truly the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and at Rp250,000 per night you could do a lot better in this area.", "Date": "Feb 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR206340865", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Bli_Gus"}, {"Content": "depends on what you want .. typical north bali average hotel - built a while ago for the boom that never came and hence looks a little tired as no funds to keep updating. The staff are great and attentive as all Balinese and food is good. I went in the shoulder season so it was a bit dead - 4 other guests. I paid Rp 40,000 for a villa - room was clean, aircon works, outside shower, bed no problem.I suggest it is good value at the price I paid provided you are not expecting Four Seasons standard for RP40,000!", "Date": "May 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR232691647", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "nzbased"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469403-d308761-r13614076-Bali_Taman_Beach_Resort-Lovina_Bali.html", "HotelID": "308761", "Price": "$102"}}
