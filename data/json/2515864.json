Its a Hooters brand so I thought that it'd at least be decent. Boy was I wrong!! My fiance and I arrived at the hotel around 9am and went to check in. The rooms weren't ready which was fine but the way the hotel receptionist barked at us was unexpected. They offered to take our luggage and hold it till a room was ready so that was nice. Went into the bathroom to at least clean up and the bathroom was awful. Its small, dirty, old. The lighting was terrible.. Mind you, I am not a picky person. I've stayed at \"Americas Best\" in Vegas before and have nicer things to say about that hotel... and its a dive lol. Anyway, back to Hooters. Went and cleaned up and played a couple slots.. The waitresses who attend the floor were nice and very fast as far as getting us a drink. Gambled for a minute and then on our way as my then fiance (now husband) had to go and get our marriage license and take care of some business around town. Anyone who's been to Vegas before knows that there is no such thing as a short journey. We left the hotel around 11am and didn't return until 1:30. Went to hotel check in again and the room wasn't ready and again the receptionist barked at us and was rude. (It was even a different girl) So when in Hooters, eat wings. The line to the restaurant was LONG!! But VERY fast. We waited maybe 10-15 in line and was seated right away. The waitstaff inside the restaurant was really nice, a lot nicer then the receptionists. After lunch we decided to call the front desk and check to see if a room was ready rather then wait in line just to be barked at...again. So we call and the room is ready. Go to the front desk, grab the key, and got lost. Front desk didn't tell us which elevator to take, finally get to the right elevators and its old, dirty and creeking. There were two elevators, one was out of order so the wait to and from your room was long and horrible. The walls were so thin that while waiting for the elevator on our floor we could hear everyone else who was inside the elevator...not on our floor. We got to the room...It was pretty big, the decor is awful but in all honesty who goes to Vegas to sit in their rooms?! Not us. The bed was big and comfy. The bathroom... HORRIBLE. There was mold and rust EVERYWHERE. Water pressure... non-existent. I have long hair and had to turn my shower into a bath as there wasn't enough pressure to even wash my hair. :-( Overall, it was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. I don't recommend it. If you are looking for a deal go to anywhere but here, after all that is bad with the hotel I was surprised to find the 21.00 resort fee charged at the end of our stay, I felt cheated as the place is falling apart.. Oh, on a more positive note... They have $1.50 Bud Lights, that was pretty awesome and the bartenders at the front of the hotel were also friendly.

I had to pick April 2011 down below which is not accurate). I was 26 at the time and my buddy was 23 and we were both single at the time. Needless to say we LOVED it. I booked through Travelocity and they put us in one of the poolside Bungalow rooms. Within seconds of dropping our bags in our room (which was just what we expected, clean and neat) we ran to the strip to get booze and came back and jumped in the pool. Being able to walk 15 steps to get into the pool from our room was great, especially for my first trip to Vegas. The staff at the hotel was tremendous. We even got to know some of the pool security personnel on a first name basis during our 5 nights. On top of being a great place to stay with cheap booze and a nice pool, the location is fine too. As someone else mentioned, sometimes it will take you 10 minutes to get to the strip from your room at the huge resorts. It was a 3 minute walk from our room to the front doors, another 4 minutes and we were on the strip. I also prefer the south end of the strip which gives Hooters another 5 out of 5. I have now been to Vegas 4 times in total and have stayed at Excalibur, Stratosphere and Treasure Island and deep down inside Hooters is still my favorite. The casino is great too. It's not huge which is nice, and I won $350 out of a slot machine which I have not even come close to replicating at any of the other casinos in the city. I hear that the hotel/casino was recently sold and purchased by a new owner. Lets hope they keep it a Hooters and never let it lose it's charm! I am now 29 and engaged to be married.

We wanted an inexpensive room so we could spend our money on the other things Vegas has to offer. I was not happy however when it finally told us we were going to be staying at Hooters. Everything I read said it was dirty and I was unhappy about the fact that it was off the strip when it said on Expedia that it was on the strip. But they are pretty stuck to their no refunds policy so Hooters it was. The room looks like most hotel rooms...bathroom, bed, tv window. Nothing special but nothing bad. I think some people mistake older for dirty. Nothing in our room was dirty however some things were a bit worn. The bed was actually pretty comfortable. The walls were thin but it really wasn't a problem. We didn't even hear people talking. There was a convenience store downstairs along with a Hooters (of course) and the Mad Onion restaurant. We only ate once at MadOnion for breakfast and it was just fine. The 25 cent wings from 12 am-6am were a nice perk too. Just keep in mind they are 50 cents if you are going to take them up to your room. Still a good bargain. I saw a couple of reviews that talked about the type of people that were in the casino and they were afraid to be there. Seriously? Its not the yuppie crowd but it's hardly a group of derelicts. Everyone we met was very friendly. As for being off the strip, I am still a bit unhappy with Expedia but really you are walking everywhere in Vegas anyway and the walk across to MGM isn't any further than between most other hotels. I wish we had a coffee maker in the room because I'm not a nice person til I have had my coffee and having to go downstairs for gas station coffee or walking over to MGM for Starbucks kind of sucked. The casino was mostly older machines which I kind of like but it's small and we were starting to get tired of playing there by the third night. Once again though it was nice to have a casino in the hotel. Here's the bottom line...I paid $45 a night in Vegas over a weekend. I had a clean, comfortable room with most of the amenities of any other room. I wanted to spend my money on nice restaurants and slot machines and the fact that I paid less for three nights and could have done four for less money than ONE night at MGM made it totally worthwhile.

A couple of tips: get a taxi from the airport as it works out alot cheaper than getting the shuttle. You can see the hotel from the air-strip (don't worry about the noise, you don't hear it!!!). As you come out of the hotel, turn left and there's a great little 24hr diner which serves the most delicious food with great service. Right next door to the diner is a 24hr liquor store which is handy if you want to avoid hefty bar prices! The hotel's casino is small (compared to the larger hotels) but is very friendly and covers all disciplines (slot machines, tables for Black Jack, Poker etc.) and the bar is the cheapest on The Strip (currently USD 1.50 for a bottle of Bud!). The rooms are large and comfortable although both my rooms didn't have a great view. I say BOTH my rooms because on the second night, the people in the room next door to me decided to have a party and, the following morning, I asked to be moved. I expected to be questioned as to why I wanted to move but I was simply given a new key so I suppose this happens quite frequently. I was quickly allocated a room in a quiet area of the hotel and didn't have any problems again so maybe it's worth requesting a \"quiet room\" when you check in. The room is big and comfy, the bed is huge and soft and the sheet and towels were clean. The bathroom was large but basic with a very powerful shower. If you don't look too closely at the carpet and the marks and scratches on the doors/walls, you'll be quite happy here. You have to overlook these things for the sake of such a great room rate - brilliant if you're on a budget!! A kettle and drinks facility would be nice but they serve drinks in takeaway cups at the bar so it's not so bad. When I was reading past reviews, I was quite nervous about the fact that smoking is permitted in casino's. I'm a non-smoker and that really bothered me. Don't worry! the larger casinos have this covered and actually smell beautiful - probably due to automated smoke diffusers! Hooters isn't so sophisticated in this respect but it still didn't make your clothes smell by hanging around in the bar/casino so I guess their air-con must be pretty effective.

I have to say the check-in staff were friendly and very helpful. The view of the was nice and the windows opened slightly for fresh air. The casino is small and easy to navaigate. The cocktail service was non-existant. My wife played a slot machine for about an hour without one offer of a drink. However, the bar by the front entrance had excellent service and Bud Light Beer for $1.50. Easy to buy others a round at that price. The dealers at the tables were friendly, except the craps table. Although, craps tables dealers tend to be crabby. We saw Raack-n-Roll. Wow! Totally horrible, we actually walked out due to the show and lack of cocktail service. We then went to Tropicana to see Eye Candy, a burlesque show, and I was totally amazed with the show. The best dancing I have seen at a burlesque show in Vegas. We ate a the Mad Onion restaurant, the complimentary steak dinner. The steak was okay and the price was right. Service their was actually pretty good. Checking my play at the end of the trip was pleasant. The staff at the players club were nice and informed me that I had enough play for a coffee mug - meh.

The hall smelled odd every now and then, but never inside the room. I had to try several floors before finding a soda machine that took bills, but a minor inconvenience at worst. The pool area was small but peaceful. It had 2 hot tubs, but one was roped off. This is not a typical vegas hotel pool...think the size/atmosphere of a days inn or la quinta.

Was going on a golf trip with 2 other guys, so Hooters was fine when we found out. Problem started at checkin. They didn't have our reservation, and said Hotwire didn't fax it. The girl at the front desk said, nothing they could do, \"next time book directly through us\". Seriously? I ask if they can call Hotwire for me - 'can't do that'. I was surprised at the attitude and inhospitality. I asked to speak with the manager - she wasn't available to talk to us. I ask if they can at least get us in a room, I'll give them my credit card number - I have confirmation number, reservation number, everything Hotwire sent me to confirm I went through and paid for this room already. While at the desk, I called Hotwire, where I was on hold for over 20 minutes. When someone finally came on, they transferred me and refaxed (they said their records showed originally faxed in June). They couldn't stay on the line with me, so waited (all the while, I'm waiting at the registration desk). I waited for another 10 minutes, it never came through, so had to call Hotwire again (again Hooters tells me, nothing they can do, I need to call them, and ask them to fax it again). They said they didn't even have Hotwire's phone number. While on hold, ask to speak to the manager again, this time she was available, this is where things started to really fall apart. She essentially said \"that's what I get for booking through a 3rd party\", I didn't even know how to respond to that. She said nothing they could do. When I finally got Hotwire on again, they again refaxed (I can't believe they're doing all this via fax). This time the Hotwire person stays on the line with me. Another 10 minutes later, Hooters finally gets it. Just to upset us more (it seemed), the counter person checks in the next group in line instead of us. All in all, I get into the hotel room over 2 hours after we got to the Hooters. No apologies, just a bad attitude. I would have been fine if they were polite about the whole matter, I understand things go wrong with technology.

However, if you are expecting luxurious accommodations you will be disappointed. Hooters is located just off the strip, a very quick walk to the strip. It has multiple pools, multiple restaurants, a bar and a casino. The rooms are large, clean and the water pressure is good. If you were to confine yourself simply to the hotel for the duration of the trip you could still have a pretty good time, definitely not the best time. After having said that, Las Vegas is designed for adult fun. Vegas can't be enjoyed from an hotel room, you have to walk the strip, eat, shop, gamble, drink, party,etc. All of these activities require one to leave their hotel room. Even if you're staying in the best penthouse suite, to enjoy Las Vegas you must leave the room. Therefore, if you are looking for a decent hotel to use as a place to sleep, shower and chill between activities then Hooters is the right choice for you.

I read a lot of reviews and say that this hotel is so far off the strip, but we arrived in the evening and walked easily to the Luxor for dinner and a show. I don't think the location is far at all. The pool is clean and the loungers are very comfortable. We also had no problem finding a sunny spot each day, maybe because we stayed during the week. The Budweiser special of $1.50 draft or bottle (including Bud lite lime, might I add) was a huge hit with my husband, especially because it was 45 degrees when we were there. The gym was nice and clean and although it is on the smaller side I think I only saw one person in there so you get the whole place to yourself.

I wont gripe about the casino and hotel layout because I could criticize any hotel in Vegas for being difficult to navigate. Luckily this hotel is small. Also, this hotel is very close to the strip. It took us only 5 minutes to walk down and cross the street to MGM. The 2 queen room was large, offered lots of storage, a separate vanity and view of the pool. Housekeeping was fantastic. Although the room was slightly dated (by Vegas standards) I felt clean and comfortable. There was an additional charge for internet that we couldnt get to work anyway. The pool area was very pretty and OPEN 24 HOURS! The main pools were far too cold to use, but there was a lot of space in the hot tub. The staff we encountered here were friendly and helpful.

The hotel rooms are not bad, although I wish we would have had one that looked out over the pool area. Speaking of the pool area, it was pretty nice. We do not drink but it does have a pool bar. It also has two pools. One that is a normal temperature and one that is beyond freezing! This is the one with the waterfall. It also has a hot tub in between the two, with ample party music in the background. The casino was not too bad, and if you get a members reward card you can choose several perks but they have a designated area of slots that you can sit down and they give you $200 (can't cash out, have to play and win something) to mess around with which one might as well do because it is free. They have a decent amount of tables as well as two $3 minimum blackjack tables which always seemed to be full especially in the evening. There are two restaurants in the hotel. Hooters and The Onion. Hooters is, well, Hooters. They have ok food, but are best known for there wings. They do however seem to nickel and dime you for everything ( extra money to add celery to your wings order?) The Onion does boast a $9.95 prime rib dinner, but it reminded me of a cheap buffet. It is nice they are open 24/7 along with anytime breakfast but the price really is not worth it and the food is not great at all. The service is also very very horrible. Only good thing was it was convenient. As far as location, casino, and value I rank it among the best.

This was my first trip there, while my friends had been there before. On a whim we booked our stay at Hooters Casino Hotel, primarily because we got dirt cheap rates through lasvegasdirect.com. According to everything I had read it was supposed to be relatvely recently renovated place, clean, and close to the strip. Two out of three's not bad, I guess. It was clean and just a block down from the strip. This is my first time putting a review in and I regret that it is a negative one. This review in no way reflects on our time visiting Vegas; it is strictly regarding the hotel we chose to stay at. Recently renovated? I seriously doubt it. When I arrived to check in I was surprised at the amount of cigarette smoke in the casino lobby. Being my first time to Vegas I thought, oh, well, I guess I'd better expect that if they still allow smoking in the casinos. It was only after we had explored the next day that I realized it was not actually common for the casinos to be poorly ventilated of cigarette smoke. The room we got had plenty of room, a view of MGM Grand, and was very clean. The beds were comfortable and I slept well. The style was dated, though, and the bathroom -- again, while clean -- was in dire need of upgrading. The floor and tub were chipped and aged, some of the caulking around the showerhead was in need of replacement, and it just felt old.

For the criticism I read- some of it is fair. My room was clean, but yes, it is dated, But my bed was comfortable and I had no issues with my bathroom which was a decent size. And for the money I spent on this hotel room- honestly- what are you expecting. It was light years better than it should have been for the money. I'd loved the fact that after I arrived I could go down and sit at a Hooters bar, order dinner with wings and an ice cold Drifter Pale Ale. I just wish they would have served this in a glass and not a plastic cup- but I'm sure there is a reason for this. The casino itself is small compared to any other Vegas Hotel. But this has its advantages too, as everyone is very friendly and they got to know me over the two days I spent here. If you are a serious gambler, you probably will want to play elsewhere. The blackjack rules were a little too favorable to the house, but hey, where else does a Hooters girl deal you blackjack? But the great part about this hotel is it sits directly across the street from the MGM Grand, making the strip and other casinos easily available for gambling.

I was totally expecting to arrive there and be bombarded with... well, Hooters.. but I was very surprised.. other than a few of the table dealers, the odd waitress and in the Hooters Restaurant itself, it was very mild... My husband and I stayed at the Hooters hotel and we had a great time!! The hotel is an excellent place to stay if you are looking for an excellent value.. don't go to Hooters is you are expecting The Bellagio.... The hotel lobby is very nice and clean. The casino part is much smaller than the regular larger casinos.... Beds are super comfortable but a bit small.... bathrooms are nice and roomy and clean.. a friendly reminder to tip the maids on a daily basis or your room won't get much attention... I usually left $1 / day and the one day I forgot, we got back to the room and the only thing that was done was the bed... carpet was not vacuumed and they \"forgot\" to leave the towels... the pool area is very nice and if you are up for getting a tattoo, there's a tattoo shop by the pool deck and they are very good at what they do.. the price is right too!!! The Mad Onion Restaurant is AWESOME and the prices are very reasonable.. especially the breakfasts!! The Hooters Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment... we went in one evening for muchies and beer and the place was sooooo loud you could not even hear yourself think and the waitresses were not very pleasant!!! When you stay on or close to the Strip, don't except to eat for cheap... cheap meals are few and far apart... be prepared to dish out at least $40-$50 per meal.... (if you are lucky) try to find buffets or spots off the strip, still within walking distance (side streets) to find good deals.... The Stratosphere and Freemont Street have great deals on buffets!!! High speed internet was a bit confusing... they have high speed but it's not WIFI... When I plugged the laptop in, it took me to the Hooters homepage and I had to choose what option I wanted to buy.. I bought the 24 hours for $12.95.. The front desk clerk informed me that it would be charged to the room so I fully expected to see it on my bill upon check out but there was no sign of it anywhere.. so not sure if it's included in your $8 / day hotel fee but it would seem like it was... in my case anyway and I did not bother asking when I checked out... When getting around on the strip... your best value for traveling if you are not in to walking the entire strip day after day.... buy a bus pass for the Deuce bus (double decker bus) they have ticket booths set up on the strip every so many feet to buy the passes... you buy a pass and it gives you access to the Deuce bus as well as the Express bus... (pick up a bus route guide to check which bus goes where you want to go)... fyi, the Express bus is much better than the Deuce with less stops... the Deuce stops at basically every larger hotel / casino on the strip where the Express only stops at a select few... must quicker to get from one end to the other of the strip!! If you are NOT in to getting roped in to Time Share or Vacation package seminars.... do not stop to talk to people on the strip who walk out in front of you offering you free stuff.. trust me.. they are everywhere.... if you don't mind spending 2-3 hours listening to their presentations, you will walk away with free stuff... I will admit, we did 2 of these vacation package seminars and ended up with tickets to a show at the Stratosphere, 2 free buffet tickets, free passes to the Top observation deck at the Strat, tickets to Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, 4 course Italian meal at Venetian and tickets for a gondola ride... so yeah, they may be annoying but you do get loads of good free stuff.... We only had a couple issues with the hotel which in my opinion were very minor...the first room they put us in had a safe that did not work and after 1.5 hrs of the maintenance dude trying to fix it, they moved us to another room... we had requested a room with a king size bed but when we arrived, they had none available in non smoking so we settled with the regular 2 double bed room.. Other than those 2 minor issues, the hotel itself is GREAT... Close walking distance to The Strip... maybe 5 min walk... So, if you are up for a nice, clean, very good deal in Vegas.. the Hooters Casino & Hotel is a perfect option...

We booked the hotel and flight about 16hrs before we took off on the plane. Surprise 10 yr anniversary getaway. (I picked the hotel by the way) My first time in Vegas and he hadn't been in about 19 yrs. Quick trip from airport. It says 1 block off the strip, but apparently Vegas blocks are larger than Louisiana blocks. This is not On The Strip as someone else wrote. There is a little bit of walking and crossing the street to get to the strip. Check in was quick. There is a resort fee of 7.50 per night, so drink those little bottles of water in your room. Still cheaper than some of the other hotels. We upgraded to a room with a view of the strip, and for my first time, it was worth it. Probably wouldn't upgrade again, but it was nice waking up in the am, opening the curtains, and seeing the Luxor, Excaliber, MGM, and the Statue of Liberty (New York New York). YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! Don't expect the Bellagio for 25.00/night. Come on....I couldn't believe some of the reviews. Here's the Nitty Gritty: Beds soft, rooms clean, bathroom roomy enough, safe in room but battery didn't work, gift shops had a variety, restaraunts were good/clean/fast, pools clean but cold, plenty of lounge chairs by pool, and plenty of slots to play in casino. Internet available, but only if you pay by the day for it. No coffee pot or refrigerator in our room. I didn't know that you could go to hotel without free wifi or a coffee pot in each room. That is just Un-American! haha So here is the fix for those, free internet at the Mcdonalds on the strip. It's a little bit of a walk but you get some exercise and fresh air. There is coffee available for purchase in the downstairs giftshop, but not for me. There are a Bizzillion Star Bucks in nearby hotels. We found one at MGM that was right inside the door that we passed by everyday. Extra Shot Recommended after staying up late everynight! Life gives you lemons, Add the Tequila and Salt. Don't just complain, drink the Margarita!! Back to Hooters...Our room was cleaned everyday. I wrote on the free tablet to leave 6 washcloths and 4 bathtowels and the maid did just that. They have a sign posted about cutting down on energy and environmental pollutants by using less towels. Sorry environment, I shower when I wake up, after swimming, and have to at least was my face before I go to bed. There was one day that our bed was not changed. That was the day that my husband went back to the room for something and left my purse on the bed. I was very happy that our cleaning lady didn't touch the bed at all. I am sure it is procedure, but it made me smile. Maids get a bad wrap sometimes, and I must admit, I too hide my valuables. Everything was in the correct place, nothing missing, nothing moved. Check out easy. Cabs waiting at 6 am to take us to airport. Overall, I would stay here again. The only complaints I have are charging for the internet, no coffee pot in the room and the distance being longer than 1 block from strip. That was poor planning on my part. I could have checked it out better, but it was a last minute trip and I didn't take the time to look into these things. Like my 7 yr old says,\" You get what you get, and don't catch a fit.!\" These were my mistakes. They do not advertise these things. I just assumed and you know the joke about assume.... I would definitely stay here again if we were looking for a quick, less expensive trip. Oh, one additional note. Next door the Tropicana is renovating, and they do start terribly early with the jackhammers and such, but that isn't Hooters problem. It's not like they can pick up and move while the construction is underway.

It wasn't enough to make us want to change rooms ( probably no different ) but it was \"grimy\" enough to make me wish I had brought my house slippers to wear in the room. We are NOT picky people, nor are we used to \"5 star\" accommodations but I do expect good general cleaning practices to be met. The carpets are in desperate need of a DEEP cleaning, if not a total replacement, even INSIDE the rooms ( the halls are worse ) and I basically used a towel, soap, and water and cleaned the bathroom floor myself once I was trying to get settled in. It had been \"cleaned\" since the last guest because it was stocked appropriately, but the bathroom floor was visibly dirty and so were the other surfaces in the room. The room had a stale smell. The bed linens \"looked\" clean and fresh, but I just had to assume they were and go with it. Basically, we were not very confident in the housekeeping practices of the place. The elevators were filthy, the tables and stools in the Hooters restaurant were sticky and quite banged-up. The cleanest areas were the pool and the front entrance where we saw people actually \"cleaning\" areas. We still enjoyed the friendly and easy check-in and the low limit tables and the cocktail service. The two husbands in our group used the hot tubs outside and we did sit by one of the \"working\" fire-pits while we were there, but it was definitely NOT worth the 7.50/day resort fee that is charged for these \"amenities\".

Like most other people say on this site, if you want an inexpensive place to stay Hooters might work for you. I feel that if they are going to continue to draw in business with their low prices and convenient location, they better concentrate on up-keep and housekeeping ( aren't there 1000's of people looking for work in LV ?) or they will not see people returning to stay at Hooters.

The room rate back then was $63 a night and we thought...it's a new hotel and we like the Hooters brand so how bad could it be? Well, it was really great to be honest! The casino was fun and lively, staff was nice and it had a Hooter's restaurant on-site, which was appropriate. The rooms were as cute as could be, mimicking the \"Hooter's\" restaurant decor. Beds were comfy. They had neat little ammenities in the bathroom. Good stuff. Welllll, we went back for a week in March 2011 and....things changed. The prices were still comparable to 2006, which we were excited about but the rooms weren't as nice. The beds seemed harder and the comforters weren't those nice plush ones anymore. Some of the touches in the room like the high-top table with the tin beer bucket for your ice were gone. We didn't even have a chair at the desk. The bathroom goodies were downgraded to the point they had that lousy shampoo & conditioner-in-one crap, so I had to go buy shampoo and conditioner separately (a girl thing). The thing that irked us the most was the fact that at 11 pm, we decided to have dinner and we came all the way back to the hotel from down the strip, specifically to have their Prime Rib that they advertise on the side of their building to be served 24/7. Well, this night they were cleaning their kitchen equipment so no Prime Rib. We could have eaten Prime Rib at several other places down the strip but toted our happy butts back to Hooters to eat at our hotel and go to bed. My husband threw up quite a fuss about it with the Chef at the restaurant and with the front desk supervisor because a hungry man with his mind set on Prime Rib is no lauging matter! Their sense of customer service was just lacking about the whole deal. Could have been easily solved by comping us another meal, but their offer was to comp us a Prime Rib dinner the next night, which my husband explained we wouldn't be there the following night. You'd think in the customer service industry you'd say, \"What can we do to make this up to you?\" But it was like, \"Oh, well, you won't be here tomorrow night.

Let me start at the lobby. As is typical at some Las Vegas casino hotels you walk in the door and you're in the casino. No problem except that the Pergo type floor is cracked and chipped. The rest of the lobby and all the rooms are decorated in \"early cheap\" with walls and mouldings decorated in knotty pine. Once in our room while taking a shower the hot water knob fell off then while closing the drapes the rod came off in my hand. We left the handle in the tub and the rod on the DIRTY carpet in front of the drape. We hoped that the maid would contact maintenance and have the problems corrected. For the next 2 days the rod remained on the carpet and the knob kept reappearing on the faucet and then falling off while we showered. The first day we went to the unheated pool we were provided towels (more like rags) the size of face towels for our usage. What we really needed was something much much larger to cover the filthy cushions. The next day at the pool there were NO towels available. It seems the security guard was in charge of pool towels and he hadn't ordered them from Mission supply. He did eventually find us a couple of room towels for use. (My wife made the mistake of entering the hot tub and has since developed a rash over large parts of her body.) After going to our room on day 3 we found there was no hot water. I called Housekeeping/Engineering and let ring - no answer. I then called the operator and asked for the manager, the phone rang and again there was no answer. I then called the front desk and was shunted to some low level manager (this on a holiday weekend). He offered to move us and gave us a $25 credit. At this point we had had it with Hooters and moved to a different hotel. At checkout, this manager charged us $8.40 per day resort fee. When asked what was included in this so called resort fee, we were told the fee was for the pool and its amenities (unheated, contaminated hot tub, no towels and filthy cushions), the toll free LOCAL calls, and the two 8oz bottles of Hooters brand water. We paid this \"extortion under protest. My advice stay far far away from this place. There are many other hotels in the area at the same or better pricing.

Arriving late we were cheerfully greeted by the manager who chatted us up while she gave us our rooms. It took maybe 10 minutes to check us in. They have limited space for check in so if a big group comes it could take awhile. The rooms are large, and I have to admit are kept very clean by the staff. They do a good job at that, and keeping the towels / toiletries / water supplied. The carpet, paint and bathroom are very tired and need to be refreshed. I kind of liked the style of the furnishings, but I am a glass half full kind of guy. The attitude of the staff was incredibly good. That was in contrast to other mega resorts I typically stay here in LV where there can be a coolness factor attitude by the staff. From the barmen to the staff in the casino everyone was friendly and willing to help. The gym is a hidden gem. It is small, but I don't think that many people come to LV to work out. I LOVED it and the pool area was inviting. However it is January so no chance to use it and generally was closed. I noticed they kept the hot tub going in the cold which I thought was decent of them. If you are a business traveller a couple of issues that I had. 1. The \"desk\" working area is not really comfortable for cranking that late night spreasheet. 2. The internet was a disaster. Came and went, and they charge $14.00 per day. Really? Also service came and went, and it seems the service provider had capacity issues, I was always getting bumped out and having to log back in which was bad. Some good things for business travellers. 1. You are close to MGM and its restaurants and stuff. 2. You are close to the monorail if you need to go the convention center. 3. The taxi line is not that long, and that is during an incredibly large convention. 4. This is a real active casino soooo its noisy and smoky. 5. Restaurant service is SLOWWWW in the early am to get seated. They evidently do not bring in the service staff until 9am. So before that you can wait 30 minutes for a table. In speaking with alot of people there, this seems to be a common complaint. You should try to negotiate free internet and get the coffee mug included which entitles you to free coffee all the time you are here. While it seems a small thing, if you come from a different time zone its nice to wake up at 4am and be able to get fresh hot coffee, and usually a smile from the attendant. In sum for business travellers there is good and not so good, but overall I would do it again since we are very budget concious.

We actually chose this hotel based on the fact that the pool was open 24 hours a day. I loved the waterfall and the way it is enclosed in the back of the property. I am going back here in March and hopefully we will get a pool view room.

There for NYE so it was NOT cheap even. I'm not one to expect a lot from Hotels like this, I mean it may not have been cheap but this wasn't a 5 star resort either. I do however expect things like a draining tub, heat, etc.... I'm not one to write a review to complain about little things that weren't perfect, we had no intentions of perfection when we booked this trip, but what we had was miserable by the end of the trip. From the 1st day the TV remote did not work and the shower did not drain, we left a note for the maid the next morning and a tip. They had no problem taking the tip but nothing was fixed. The heat was a MAJOR issue - you have to understand this was what we were told one of the COLDEST winters they have seen in Vegas - the 1st 2 days it was super hot in the room, it was hot or cold, no ability to regulate but we could live with that. By day 3 the heat completely stopped working, none, in fact cold air was coming into the room through the unit (again coldest Vegas winter). So I asked the front desk to take care of the heat, shower, and tv. Come back later at night, nothing. No note, message, etc saying it could not be fixed and nothing was fixed. I again asked the front desk to take care of it the next day and again we were ignored. So all said and done we spent 3 nights in the room w/ no heat during one of the coldest spells in Vegas ever and I end up taking pneumonia home as a souvenir. Thus it really ruined the trip. Yes I supposed I could have gone down and complained, yelled, etc and what? then get a response and maybe get moved to another room that from what I read on other reviews probably will have similar issues but the point is I shouldn\u2019t have to raise a stink to get something looked at with the room....Especially heat when it's cold out!!!! I don\u2019t care if I ask the maid, front desk, doorman, etc, I don\u2019t care who I ask to get something with the room fixed nor how big or small the issue is... they should take it to the proper person and get it resolved or advise you they can not fix it and move you....Especially at NYE rate prices!!!! Obviously that is not how Hooters operates this establishment and once they get your money they really don't care if you have an issue because mine went completely unacknowledged. The sad part is I really did like the location, the casino, restaurants and the bar/wait staff were excellent. The entertainment offerings were decent and they had some good players club promos. It could have been a great trip and excellent review but the lack of attention to resolve our issues ruined everything and literally made me sick!! In addition they also charge like a $8.50/ day resort fee for things like the pool (which you couldn't use unless you were a polar bear), 2 small bottles of water in your room, etc. not well worth it by any means.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hayward, California", "Title": "\u201chooters suck!\u201d", "Author": "nellie1977", "ReviewID": "UR91773520", "Content": "i went to stay at hooters over the NYE weekend. we checked in on dec 31st.The hotel ventilation was bad alot of smoke.Hotel is nasty and dirty.

I have never had such a terrible experience in my entire life, and I am very well traveled... and been to Vegas many, many times. I booked a standard room, so I knew before going that it wouldn't be super luxurious by any means.... while sleeping on my first night, I was rudely woken up by loud noises in the room next to me.... it wasn't partying by others - rather, it was construction in the room next door, which began at approx 8am!!! For the first 20 mins, all I could hear was probably about 6 men (the construction workers) yapping in Spanish before they actually got to work and began ripping up the carpets, moving beds... basically making a TON of noise. The walls were incredibly thin, so it sounded like they were right in my room! I called the front desk, where a lady said she would look into what was going on and call me back. After enduring 20 mins of more noise, she never called me back. I called her back and asked WTF is the noise about? She said they were renovating the room and HUNG UP on me! I was pretty PO'd at how she spoke to me, so I went downstairs to speak to her supervisor. Her supervisor apologized and moved me into a suite away from the construction...... this is where things really get brutal..... I move to the suite upstairs, unpack all my stuff (remember, this is at about 8am...) and lay down on my bed.... and I feel a DRIP OF WATER hit me! I look up and realize that water is dripping thru the ceiling!!! I moved the bed and put a bucket under the drip and tried to get some sleep.... woke up a few hrs later, went out for the day/night.... returned to the room in the evening and was blown away to see WATER POURING thru the ceiling now! I had to change rooms AGAIN! My 3rd night in my 3rd room was (thankfully) rather uneventful... The third room I was in had old food left in the fridge, but I managed to just keep it closed and ignore it. I was so fed up at this point. I stayed in and caught up on sleep (because I was so exhausted from the chaos from the 2 prior nights) and this essentially had me waste my last night in Vegas. I am back home in Vancouver from my \"vacation\" which really wasn't much of a vacation at all. I was extremely upset that my Vegas holiday went like this and Hooters Hotel is solely to blame. The rooms were absolutely horrible, noisey, and leaking tons of water..... and to top it all off the staff was rude to me and never offered me any real compensation or apology. Not only will I never go back to a Hooters restaurant or hotel, but I will tell all my friends and family to avoid this dump like the plague that it is.

The plus side about arriving so late, there should be very little wait to check in, right? It was a 6 hour flight and given the time difference, I was ready just to hop in bed. Of course, that didn't happen. My friend's name was not in the system and the check in staff wouldn't do anything about it even though we had the paperwork from Expedia!!! The only thing they'd do was to charge her the rate of the room that night until they could find the reservation in the morning? HELLO!?!!? WTF. We already prepaid! Plus, why would we need another room if I had one, right? Why would I not let my friend who travelled with me stay if there was an issue instead of paying for another room, right? You know what the lady said to me. Well, it wouldn't be fair to you because you paid for the room and she's getting a \"free\" stay? Cheap friends? Weird.

While I don't think it's a place for me, I also wonder who they are marketing to. What age demographic? What income level? What type of casino players? Before I review the hotel portion, All I can say is that I would not be that person in any of those questions I asked. Onto the hotel portion: What can I say? You get what you pay for. In this case, this was a free stay, and that's why I put the value on five, or else it would have been a one. I'll start from when we arrived at the hotel: 1. (Read this only if you plan on having a car, and plan on self-parking) When you drive on E Tropicana Ave, you'll see the hotel, and will start looking for parking signs. The valet sign is very prominent, but you'll have to slow down to see the signs for self-park. Once you know to turn the corner for self park, you'll find another sign that tells you to turn into a drive way... a very dark and secluded driveway at night. It almost looks like a delivery entrance. You'll pass the Hooters bungalows before you make a turn again towards the garage. It seems like an insecure area as there was a homeless person hanging out between some parked cars. Once you reach the parking structure, it gets better. We park on level 3, and head towards the elevators. When you press the down button on any of the two elevators, the lights do not light up. After waiting a minute or so, you begin to think that maybe the elevators are out. Wrong, the down buttons to the Casino are BROKEN! You need to press the up button, and either ride up with someone or be fortunate to go down after the elevator comes. There is only one elevator shaft working when I got there as the other one was in repair. This means one elevator is serving 8 floors of parking! 2. Once you reach the casino floor, you have to maneuver around the Owl Rewards Club service area with all your luggage as there isn't much space for the service line, and you all passing through. 3. The check-in was smooth and emotion-less, so I have no opinions here. The only thing interesting was that the check-in person told me the rooms were renovated 4-6 months ago. Either she was mistaken, or just plainly lied. 4. The room... oh boy the room. The heater is so old and loud and turns on and off so often that it wakes you up from sleeping. This should be the ultimate reason not to stay here if you think you'll get some sleep (I just turned it off in the middle of the night and slept close to my wife. Baby had a thick blanket that we brought). The rooms are not renovated because there are snags in the carpet, the furniture are worn, and the bed is super soft. If you like to sleep warm, don't expect a warm comforter, and you'll need to ask for an extra blanket rather than finding a blanket in the closet. IF YOU HAVE A BABY, and ask for a crib, it's a pack n' play that doesn't come deployed, you need to do it yourself. The pad was disgusting with stains, and we got extra sheets to cover the pad. The bathroom sink and shower drains very slow, and the shower is such a water miser, that you might prefer to take a bath. Last but not least... old school TVs. Long story short, I think if I was really budget minded, and had a car, I would stay at TripAdvisors #2 Vegas hotel: The affordable Staybridge Suites. There are pros and cons to this hotel. To summarize: Pros: - Relatively close to the Strip for budget minded visitors. - Hooters wings - Doesn't smell - complementary bottled water in rooms Cons: - Self parking not convenient - Hotel rooms needs major refurbishment - Carpets and bathrooms floors need to be cleaned better - Dust coated fake plants in room (Beware if you have allergies) - Pay internet", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, VA", "Title": "\u201cA bit scuffed up, but a great value\u201d", "Author": "rasmith59", "ReviewID": "UR89419074", "Content": "This is the 3rd time I've stayed at HHC.

But this last visit we made on Nov.28-Nov.30,2010 was so terribly disappointing for a number of reasons. 1) I paid the extra money for what I thought was an Upgrade room, which it wasn't,the floor we were on was the Ocean View Room1743 which had construction going on in the parking lot directly below us and we could hear all the work going on early in the morning 2) Then if that wasn't enough, there was a baby in one of the rooms near us. With the baby crying and crying first thing early morning! WOW what a way to wake up after going to bed late. 3)Our Ocean View room was not to clean, I mean the maid did what she could, but the room was just so worn,old and beat up looking. The tolit only flushed by holding down the handle contiueous and the shower was stained. Like I said, the maid was doing all she could. 4)I was hoping to get 2 for 1 tickets to the \"Purple Reign\" show for Sunday night. I spoke to the Host Joe. He informed me that I couldn't get 2 for 1 tickets, but that I could have $5 off each ticket and he could give us Comp. tickets for the Todd Paul show at 8pm. So we agreed, hoping to just enjoy a nice meal at the Hooter's Restrurant and then make it to the Todd Paul show and then the Purple Reign show. Well we go up to the 8pm show and other people where coming down saying that there was no Todd Paul show, he was cancelling it. Meanwhile, there where other people also waiting for the elevator to up to the show...but right at 8:04pm the show was cancelled. I feel that the show was cancelled way to soon, before people could get up to sit down. Then they told us, we could trade these cancelled tickets for another show, including the Purple Reign show, but I had already purchased the tickets. So there was nothing they could do, I couldn't get 2 for 1 tix, but they could exchange comp tickets for it...I don't get it??? why not just make the customer happy to begin with! why this whole dog and pony show? 5)Finally it was time for us to check out and I go to the front desk. I find out at check out that the \"NOT Upgrade room\" is being charged to me at an extra $10 per nite plus tax and was told the room was not an upgrade, but that the extra $10 per nite was to gurantee me a room reservation for the nights I requested, What!!! I didn't see that Hooters was sold out for those days, correct me if I'm wrong. Well anyways, I'm not writing this review just to be nitpicky, but to sincerely let your organization know what is going on at your place of business. I realize how competitive Las Vegas is for business. So as a past customer, I just wanted to let you know how terrible my visit was and I know for a fact that some of those other people that where there the night of the 8pm show cancellation were not happy and infact turned in their Club cards.

This hotel is a short walk from the strip but if you have comfortable shoes, it's not bad at all. There is also a small grocery store the opposite way a block or 2 down if you don't want to pay the high prices in the gift shop at the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. The sheets were bright white and crisp! The bathroom was clean and stocked with everything we needed. The maids came anytime of day, even when we slept in, they would come and clean it in the afternoon. We slipped them a few dollars here and there. We stayed 4 nights and had no problems with anything in the room. The carpet could be replaced, but other than that, everything was nice and clean. The Mad Onion restaurant had great french onion soup. Then of course Hooters wings were good too. We ordered them crispy, naked and hot and they were awesome! If you buy a coffee mug in the gift shop, you can use it for free coffee the whole time you are there. The service was great, everyone was friendly. The $3.00 blackjack tables were fun because we are not big gamblers and the dealers would help us learn to play and we didn't feel intimidated like the higher stake tables. We were there Sunday - Thursday so not able to try out the nightlife bar in the hotel, it wasn't open. We spent one afternoon at the pool. It's very nice with a waterfall and 2 hot tubs.

The bathrooms need maintenance (simple things like caulk to fix the leaks). While everything seems to be generally clean, my wife says it all smells like chicken. When trying to redeem the $100 credit from our package deal, we are told that it is just an advertisement and everyone gets $100 in \"promotional\" slot play. I'm already irritated that I paid an extra $100 to find out that all club members get $100, but also find out that the \"promotional\" slots are a specific set of slot machines that are $5 machines that require max play ($10). These credits are not able to convert to cash and the only winnings are in 10 different payouts ranging from tickets to the in-house show to wings to more promotional slot play. Nothing I saw indicated this was not $100 in play in the actual casino, so I'm quite disappointed with this experience. Overall, it's a mediocre casino and a lower mid-range hotel.

This was not advertised anywhere. We had a budget of $150 a day and now told had to hand over $250!!!! Was told if put it on Debit card it would be refunded backk THE DAY WE LEFT. As this money was the only money we had when we got back to UK we went with that after checking with the girl 3 TIMES tht it would be refunded. Went up to room. VERY LOUD AC but try to leave it on in day with your curtains shut and you shouldnt need to have it on through the night. Cleanliness was average the hotel very worn. Gaffer tape over floor in casino... holes in chairs and stains on betting tables. Toilets did not flush well and sometimes had to go back for 2nd try. Staff... RUDE!!! Ugly people get put on reception and bar - and have attitude because they know thats the reason!!! Slightly less ugly people work in HOOTERS Restaurant (Wings MING!!!! couldnt finish them) One 'HOOTERS girl was a old as my gran and another was walking around 8 months pregnant!!! Drinks girlsthat come around when your bet make you feel as if its an effort to serve you and find a $1 tip offensive!! Bars are under staffed and staff are more interested in drinking table customers drinks and chatting to each other! Didnt find it very proffesional when a lady, who was quite drunk ,was losing at Blackjack while sitting at the Sports Book and staff continuly took the micky out of her with each other. Pool: Pointless... had a sewage smell.. Drinks double in price and Water dirty and very cold compared to other hotels. Situated in wrong place so 2 hrs sun a day. This then made me annoyed as i paid $84 resort fee - Pool, Gym, Water in Room (2 small bottles that were never replaced) and Internet (im on holiday dont need internet) so felt robbed by resort fees.NB: Ceasars Palace is open to the Public and amazing!!! Head there!! At Check out I asked if the 'deposit' was put back on my card - was told 'it will be ma'am in 5-7 working days'... Pardon?

The tub lacked proper disposal of water when trying to shower. It is very unpleasant to stand in dirty water while trying to get clean, especially if the tub lacked proper cleaning from housekeeping. The room had a smell from the kitchen, where fried food was being cooked. Mind you that we are on the 8th floor of the tower. Security was not very attentive to their job. For example, the front staging area where the valet is located, a red Jeep Cherokee was left running with the door open for well over an hour and nothing was done to have the vehicle removed from the property. Only action that was taken was an intercom announcement to be made. There wasn\u2019t a door latch for the room door, which made my wife feel unsafe. The only lock there was, was on the door. The other door located in the room that adjoined the other room was thin and not sealed sufficiently. We were able to see through the door cracks when the lights were off, not to mention the noise. My wife did not sleep due to the neighbors coming in late and talking loudly. I will never stay or do business with any of the Hooters properties in the future.

The Hooters Hotel and Casino was the best deal available considering how last minute my booking was. I read several reviews about this hotel and after staying there over Labor Day weekend, I have to say that the negative reviews for the most part are a bit unfounded. Yes, when you look at many of the other hotels in Vegas, particularly the MGM grand across the street, (the other couple we were with stayed at Caesar's Palace and they said the MGM was better), the Hooters pales in comparison. However, that's not to say it's a bad hotel. If you have ever been to Hooters, then you know what to expect. The hotel IS the restaurant with a place to sleep. Check-in was quick and the customer service was great. The two issues I encountered were easily remedied. First Issue: We were originally given one of the ground floor bungalow rooms. The patio door did not lock, which was a safety issue considering it opened right out to the parking lot. One phone call to the front desk and we were quickly moved to a larger room in the Bayside Tower. Room was basic but clean. Second Issue: Internet in the room did not work, but I was able to take my laptop to the Bait Shoppe, (24 hour onsite convenience store), and plug in right there for FREE, avoiding the $12 internet fee altogether. Yes, the carpets in the HALLWAYS ONLY were a bit worst-for-wear, but the carpet in the room was clean, no stains, but really carpet? There are lots of pluses to this hotel. Location: 10 minutes from the airport, walking distance from 24 hour liquor store, across the street from the monorail and the MGM Grand, walking distance from the strip. Pricing: Drinks are literally 50% cheaper than if you bought them at another hotel. Plus you can buy a bottle of your favorite spirit right at the Bait Shoppe, (little bit of a markup), but given that you can walk with your drink throughout Vegas it's a good way to drink on a budget. Table games had pretty low minimums, which made for more gambling with less risk. 24 Hour Amenities: The 24 hour pool is an awesome amenity; there was always someone out there. $3 meal after midnight at the Mad Onion was awesome after staggering back from the club at 5am and the Bait Shoppe access was great too. Gym was nice too! As a gym rat that is important. By Vegas standards Hooters is certainly a no frills hotel. If you are in Vegas to spend the bulk of your time on the casino floor and take advantage of the Hotel amenities then you should book elsewhere. However if you are looking for a decent place at a good price that you can use as your home-base while you explore the strip, Hooters is spot on.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marina, California", "Title": "\u201cThe biggest disappointment in Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "riggerone", "ReviewID": "UR78517333", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights paying $259.00.

This isn't true - I saw lots of couples and families at the hotel. In fact, I got talking to my neighbour on the 5th floor who was a lady from Minnesota who was sharing a room with her elderly mother who was seriously ill and wanted to do Vegas while she had the chance.

When we called a woman answered the phone & gave us a rate for that night I asked if we needed to make a reservation & she said no just come on in. When we got there we got a totally different rate then what we had been told on the phone not even 45 mins earlier. Then as we agreed to this new higher rate the woman who started to check us in stopped & asked the man standing next to her if that was the rate & he told her no that it was higher then that. I tried to talk to the woman & find out why the rate had gone up now two times in a matter of a little over an hour compared to when we got the first rate and then tried to check in. She started to explain to us why this was then was interrupted by the man that was next to her & he then proceeded to tell us that if we want a room at the rate that he had told her a few moments ago then we had to pay for it then cause the rates were going up as we spoke. I found that rather odd due to the fact that it was getting late into the night I think that we had got there about 11 pm. So we got the room and when we got to our room we found we didn't have a remote & so I called downstairs & a woman transferred me to housekeeping in which I was told that we would have one brought up in a short time. An hour passed by & we still didn't have a remote so I went to the front desk & was told that it must of been change of shift & that they will try to find one I stood at the desk for over 30 mins then was told that they were having to go take one from another room. So I told them that I was going to get something from our car & when I went to the elevator is was broken. I asked the front desk about it & was told that I would have to take the stairs to the level I was parked on. We had parked on the 4th floor. So I went outside to walk up the stairs & I was approached by two males that offered to walk with me, but I wasn't comfortable with that so I went back into the lobby & asked the man at the desk if I could have someone walk with me & he said that he didn't have anyone to go with me at that time. There was a security guard there by the desk & he said that he would go with me but was told to go to rooms to try to find a remote for us. Then when we were getting ready to check out I had looked at the printout of the charges & there were double billings on it for things.

We visited nearly every casino on the strip and the service from the cocktail waitresses when playing was as good as any other casino. The hotel rooms were very clean, however the \"double\" beds were pretty small, so if you're sharing a bed, although everything was clean, its basically a twin bed. You should probably watch out for the additional charges, because although you pay an $8.50 resort fee, internet is not wireless and costs $13 per day to use the ethernet jack. In addition to that it costs $.75 each time you make a phone call, even if its local or on a calling card. The pool area is beautiful, but the pool tends to always be bit dirty by the end of the day, however the staff is up every morning cleaning it for the next day.

Being a spring break weekend where Vegas was busy, I sought to avoid spending $500 a night or more on a hotel room that I spend very little time in. Therefore, I chose Hooters because of its moderately convenient location and cheap rooms. The rooms themselves were fairly nice. I stayed on the 17th floor with a view of the strip. The room was spacious and nicely appointed. I didn't find any problems like other reviews I have read, and the room was definitely nicer than rooms I've had at the Excalibur and Flamingo. However, in my seven previous trips to Vegas, I have only paid for my hotel room once without being comped based on my level of casino play. The casino at Hooters is very small compared to other strip casinos, but with 2 craps tables, I didn't expect having a problem getting a game. The problem is, 95% of the time only one table was open, and a \"rocky\" one at that--it wobbled anytime someone leaned against it. The one table was busy constantly, with people often 2 deep waiting to get into the game. At the times when both tables were open and full, after only being open a short time, they pulled the dealers off the table for other duties and closed the table despite being full. Then, the other table had an even longer wait than usual. I got fed up and played craps elsewhere for the weekend. I asked the cashiers at the casino cage why the tables were run so poorly, and was told that the casino was not fully staffed for the weekend and they couldn't handle the amount of people playing. It fails me to understand how a casino in a pretty prime location next to the Tropicana and MGM Grand could not adequately staff the casino on a spring break weekend when the town is fairly busy. Despite these problems, I tried to make the most of my hooters play in order to gain complimentary service, and chose to play video poker and blackjack instead. I spent a great deal of time doing this, playing $40 hands of blackjack. When checking out of the hotel and speaking with the host, how much of my room was comped? $12. This is a sad excuse for a casino.

The hotel delivered on the first two criteria but massively failed me on the third, although failure was in fact part of my expectation for the brand. I'm not a fan of Hooters Restaurants (I find them misogynistic and crude) but I was quite happy to go with the flow if their was tangible enthusiasm on their side. In spite of my theoretical contempt for their misogyny, I'm not above a little flirtation and titillation, and especially at the end of a long tiring flight. Well, what a disappointment. I expected a buxom cute Front Desk staffer; instead, I got a sullen, bored, going-through-the-motions staffer not even dressed in the Hooters Girls uniform. She couldn't have been less interested in me or my stay, and seemed extremely irritated by the bother of having to check me in. And at a $32 room rate, I guess I could understand that - but no excuse. My online booking was supposed to come with $x of free slots chips and two free beers at the bar, but when I asked for them I was flatly denied, and after a long trans-continental flight and no real passion for gambling anyway, I didn't bother to press the point. Walking through the casino to the elevators was an exercise in sociological depression, looking at all the sad, marginalized, white trash patrons trying to convince themselves they were living some down-market version of the Vegas dream. And nowhere was there any evidence of the Hooters brand I was looking for: only 2 Hooters Girls waitresses did I see (neither of them buxom!) and none of the irrepressible, irreverent attitude that's supposed to make this place fun in spite of all the political incorrectness against which they rail. In a way, it was precisely what I was expecting: sad, sleazy, depressing, and dirt cheap: I slept for 5 years (the room was comfortable enough but felt like it was at the end of a shuttle to Mars it felt so far away and isolated), and then got the hell out. On my way out, the same girl who checked me in was still on shift when I checked out, and her attitude had not improved (nor her memory as she apparently had zero recollection of me checking in 6 hours earlier). In summary: to expand your horizons (downwards) for a cheap-as-chips alternative to sleeping on an airport bench, Hooters will give you a clean-enough bed close to the airport ($32, you can't go wrong for mere shelter); for anything, anything else in Vegas - you can do better.", "Date": "March 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "utah", "Title": "\u201cThe Vegas stay that let me down.\u201d", "Author": "tanmantin", "ReviewID": "UR58916704", "Content": "We were looking forward to our stay with you all.

Spent 2 nights at the Trump Tower in a 1 bedroom suite for 150/night and wanted to stay one night at Hooters just for the fun of it, since we like the Casino there and love the wings. What a mistake. Upon checking in, we were told by the front desk staff that the room we were booked in was 'old and run down' and they suggested that we upgrade. We had prepaid 40.00 for a regular bungalow room. I asked what the cost would be to upgrade and was quoted that a nicer room in the tower would be 75.00. I specifically asked if the total cost of the room would be 75.00, or if that was the cost in addition to what we had already paid. I was told that 75.00 was the total cost for the room, which was a suite. I agreed to the upgrade and we went up to the room. Please know that I understand that this is a 3 star hotel and that the theme of the hotel is 'Delightfully tacky yet unrefined'. We were ready for some intentionally bad decor. What we were not ready for was the poor state of repair that the room was in, tacky decor aside, the hideously outdated bathrooms with linoleum peeling up from the floors and the complete lack of service or regard from the staff. When we arrived in our room, I immediately called housekeeping to ask for extra blankets. I was advised that there were no clean blankets available for delivery and that they were all currently being washed. I told the rather unfriendly housekeeping representative that anything would do, a blanket or a comforter or even some extra sheets, and she still insisted that there was nothing clean in the entire hotel that she could bring me. Really? Three hours later, there was a banging on the door and when I opened it, there lying on the floor outside of the door was a rolled up comforter. I should also note that as a part of our reservation package, we were supposed to get free breakfast coupons. We didn't get the coupons and when I asked about them I was advised that the promotion was no longer going on, even though I booked this room last week. Upon check out, I was shocked to be presented with a bill for almost 100.00. I asked what the charges were for and was advised that the upgrade fee was 75.00. I explained that I had been told that the entire cost of the room was 75.00 and the 40.00 I had already paid would be applied to that. The girl just shook her head at me and stared past me as if I wasn't even there and said 'No, the upgrade was 75.00 on top of what you already paid.\" I asked to speak to a manager and was advised that there was no one available. I imagine they must have been washing blankets or something. In summary, I would never ever in my life stay at this hotel again. Ultimately, I shelled out 115.00 to stay in a 'suite' at a 3 star hotel with bad dirty carpet, hideously old and decrepit bathrooms and some of the worst service I have ever experienced. Shocking, considering I had just spent 2 nights in a one bedroom suite at the Trump for 150.00 per night with an enormous marble bathroom, stunning decor, a full kitchen and was treated like royalty. There is nothing delightfully tacky about this piece of crap hotel. Come for the wings and the casino, and then leave. *Business travelers beware: You are charged a resort fee at this hotel, but it does not include internet service.

Instead of asking the man politely to leave, the pit boss took the side of the man calling his dealer vulgar names. The two times we tried to be seated in the Mad Onion we could hardly get anyone to seat us. We were seated late at night after a 5 minute wait when there was only one other table occupied. The next morning for breakfast, there were twenty people in line waiting to be seated without the restaurant being full. We waited in this line 15 minutes before we decided we would eat somewhere else. We collected our belongings from our room and checked out two days early. No one even asked why we were checking out early. It felt like all of the employees thought they only had a week left before they were out of jobs and didn't know if their paychecks would be good. No one cared....about anything.... It was not a good atmosphere. As a travel agent, I know that good service goes a long way to overcoming the rest of the travel experience.

I decided to stick it out with the $39/night rate and hope for the best. The hotel was much better than expected. Like others have mentioned, they sell out of the bungalow rooms fast so you'll be offered a free \"upgrade\" upon check in. I would imagine all the rooms are the same except for the presidential and international suites. The rooms in the towers are attached to the casino/lobby. The bungalow rooms surround the pool but are not connected to the casino. The pool area looked clean and professional. We did not test the water but I have no reason to believe it was anything less than acceptable. The staff was friendly at check-in (~15 min) and throughout our stay. The hooters restaurant was one of the best I've been to recently. The waitresses did not have bad attitudes or seem unhappy like some hooters around the country. Dan Marino's is a little weak as far as upscale dining. We chose to eat at Smith and Wolensky, The Palm, Spago for fine dining. We ordered room service one morning. The service was quick and the food was hot. Probably a better deal than Marino's breakfast buffett too. The room was clean, bed was nice, bathroom was acceptable, hallways and elevator areas were clean and well lit. I did not see any reason to complain especially for the price. The casino has a generous amount of slots and other computer games. The table games are sparce. 2 roulette tables, 4 bj, 2 craps, and a couple different poker tables. They do offer a daily poker tournament with reasonable buy in. I did not feel uncomfortable with the patrons in the casino. Plenty of security presence. The location is ok if you don't mind walking or taking cabs. It's approx. $10 to cab to mid strip (ceasar's, ph, paris, etc...) Walking to the strip depends on your pace but a brisk pace put us in front of MGM on the strip in approx 10 minutes. We did not check out the enterainment or nightlife at hooter's but you can receive free tickets to the magic show by signing up for the owl club rewards card. This was my 3rd trip to vegas in '09. I probably will not stay here again due to location. We enjoy being on the strip moreso than off. If you are looking for a clean, safe, cheap room close to the strip this is your place.

Overall, very disappointing. The casino is small but nice. We spent the majority of our gambling money in the hotel because of the Owl Rewards Club card the hotel offers. At the end of our stay, though, our points only bought us a $19 meal. The Onion Restaurant was a nice, affordable place to eat - our waitress was upbeat and friendly, and the food was not bad. Be warned, however, that starting at midnight, they have a 25 cent wing special, so the line winds through the casino - it can be a long wait. The hotel features Purple Reign - it is a Prince tribute band and well worth the $25 each ticket price. The singer was spot on, and we had a great time at this show. Also, keep in mind that this hotel is kind of far down on the south side of the strip, so you will have to either walk a lot, or pay for a cab or monorail ticket to get to a lot of the other attractions/hotels further down.

I booked 2 double beds. Not until I hiked up to the 12th floor did I find out that I was given 1 King bed. When I went down to ask for it to be corrected, there was no apology but made me feel like I made the mistake. Their website stated 100 free tokens but I had to get up to my 12th floor to discover they forgot to give them to me. Vending machine was dripping of water and had been for 2 days straight. It also ate my $2.00! Regarding the housekeeping......awful! i purposely left tissues on the floor to see if they'd pick them up and guess what??? No, they left them right there!

Pros: Small casino - easy to get to/from your room. Didn't do much gambling, but made out pretty good on what I did, and the cocktail waitresses were quick to bring comped drinks, even when I was just playing penny slots. Very friendly staff - upgraded my room for free, bartenders were cool and made good drinks. Nice eye candy from most of the Hooters girls. Decent location - technically off the strip, but you can be on Las Vegas Blvd. within minutes. If you cross Tropicana to the MGM's back entrance, it is a quick walk to get to the monorail. If you're planning to go downtown, you can head a block south and get the route 109, which is cheaper, less crowded, and much faster than the Deuce. Room service food was good overall - got to my room in about 15 minutes and the quality of the food actually wasn't that bad. Good deals on food if you're not too picky - the Dan Marino's tries to be classy but basically it's a glorified Hooters. The 25 cent wings after midnight did hit the spot after a long day of drinking though. Beds were clean and comfortable. It was actually pretty quiet in the hallways and I didn't hear any noise from my neighbors - overall I got some good sleep in the room. Cons: Elevators look and sound like they're about to collapse. They're almost as bad as the notorious ones at the Imperial Palace. Hallways and rooms are in serious need of rehab. New paint job and carpets are in order - lots of stains, cigarette burns, etc. A room service tray I placed outside of my room to be picked up was left there for over 24 hours. Ice and soda machines on the floor did not work. A/C unit was extremely loud. TV seemed like it was about to go on the fritz - sound kept going in and out. Ordered a movie one night and it kept going back to the PPV menu. Overall, if you're a guy looking for a cheap room to basically sleep and shower in, and aren't picky about your accomodations, this might fit the bill. Overall, if you're looking for cheap digs, I would prefer getting something closer to midstrip like Imperial Palace or Bill's, but if you get a good deal, Hooters may be worth your while. FYI - do not take a shuttle from the airport to get here. I figured that since Hooters was so close to the airport, it would be a quick trip - no such luck. Took well over a hour, and the shuttle I arranged to pick me up was over a half hour late before I decided to just grab a taxi.

The bed had no sheet on it and we had to call room service up to see if they could put a sheet on our bed, which took 2 hours. Our room keys constantly would not work and we would have to make frequent trips back to the front desk to get out keys renewed.

I have never had a problem with my room, the beds are large, and I have never had a reason to complain about anything. The bathrooms are fine too. The pool area is decent, small, but there is a pool side bar, and although the pools are small, they are decent enough, and some of them are heated. The casino area is small, and the bar near the entrance of the hotel is tiny, but we only really use it as a meeting point, or for a quick drink before heading out elsewhere. There is a restaurant called Dan Marino's, I have eaten there a few times for breakfast, and it does good food and is handy late at night when you've got the munchies. There is a 24 hour shop next door to Hooters too, so you can get drink and snacks to have in your room from there, as well as toiletries etc, so that's handy.

As we were walking the wind was so bad we only made it to the Tropicana next to Hooters we looked around while we were there and since I had just drove close to 11 hours so I was tired and we decided to get some of the Hooters Famous Wings (big disappointment) Hooters will not sever you if you walk-up and order at the bar you need to buy a drink and put a nipple on it because the wings take a long to fly to you. So after 15-20 minutes waiting we finally got them and since there was no sitting spaces available and I had an 18 Pack of Ice Cold Corona's in the room we went back and ate there.

I turned in about 11pm I know it's early but I was up at 4am that morning and drove all the way here so I was tired! Then about 2:30am I woke up needed to take a wizard as I walked in to the bathroom I turned on the light and there they were COCKROACHES scattering I did my business and woke the wife and call the front desk, the said they would look in to it, but what was there to look at I wanted them dead or a new room out of the bungalow area too close to the pool and that attracts roaches. I could not wait or sleep so I went to the front desk. Now surprisingly the guy there was looking for another room and he said he tried calling the room with no answer but who knows for sure if he did. He had another bungalow room which I turned down so he put us up on the 15th floor in the tower, a lot better away from the pool and roaches. I even took one of the bell hops since he was there not doing any thing and he was cool we drank a couple of beers as we moved, he had to be discrete about it but in the next few days he hooked us up with tickets and booze as long as he could have a few drinks in our room I was cool with that he even brought a pizza and a big calzone on night about midnight some one ordered it and got in to a fight and checked out.

You don't even have to be actually playing a table or a machine and they'll bring you whatever you ask for. Dan Morhino's Restaurant was a bit of a disappointment frankly - nothing more than average.

The whole hotel is a bit reminiscent of a beachy/surfer atmosphere down to the surfboards hanging on the walls and the \"sandy footprints\" in the hallways. My trip was a 5 day stay from Wednesday through Monday during Spring Break/March Madness so the city was hopping. I went with three college friends and even with being four 20-something girls staying at Hooters, we had a blast and really enjoyed the hotel. We also felt extremely safe, as we had difficulty with an obnoxious drunk guy harassing one of our friends one night. The security, casino, and hotel staff were wonderful and took care of it immediately. The room cost us $39 (Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights) to $99 per night (Friday and Saturday nights). The rooms were nothing terribly special, similar to a Holiday Inn or any other basic hotel chain you might stay at (also similar to your average room at Excalibur, Tropicana, etc) but the room was clean, the beds were comfortable, in-room safe was provided, and our view was of the south end of the strip - NYNY, Exalibur, Mandalay Bay, the Luxor, the MGM, and the Tropicana and was stunning at night. Some people say this hotel is off-strip and technically it is, but it is basically like being on the strip. It is next door to the Tropicana and across the street from the MGM grand - it is about the same walking distance to the strip as from either of those places once you account for the fact that both of those casinos are much larger and it takes a long time to get to your room once inside. We had friends staying at Excalibur and the Tropicana, and it didn't take us any longer to get back to our room from an activity than it did for them. The pool was warm - a bit small, but fun and PACKED when we were there. It was definitely a party atmosphere in the pool area, lots of people in our age range and high-energy music playing. The pool bar (nippers) served great frozen drinks and there was towel service. In the casino, all of the dealers (a mix of Hooters girls and regular dealers) were friendly and helpful. The casino is small, but laidback and fun and a good place to wind down the evening. Everything is decorated in bright lights and light pine and the music is always jamming. The only real complaint we had was about the restaurant (not the Hooters one) - we went for brunch our second day and the service was slow and the food overpriced. I like to stay in a new place everytime I go to Vegas, but if I got a good deal here I would go back.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "stevesweezie", "Title": "\u201cClean Room - LOOSE Slots\u201d", "Author": "stevesweezie", "ReviewID": "UR26584281", "Content": "We booked this because the last time we were in Vegas, we kept winning on the slots in Hooters.

Never heard a peep except for the loud lady across the hall slamming her door a few times. Didn't notice an visible remodeling but don't have anything to compare to as this was our first stay. Everything was in good shape in our room...some warn spots on the chair but HEY IT's A HOOTERS Hotel..what do you expect? SLOTS WERE LOOSE. My sister's boyfriend won $1200 within the first 12 hours we were there. Marino's Restaurant has a great breakfast buffet..timing is everything.. food goes quick and you have to wait for more fresh food. Take advantage of the Owl Rewards Club upon arrival. We got two great coupon books and ate breakfast half price for two days. Regular portions off the menu for breakfast included alot of food! When checked out, my husband and I both got money back from playing on the slots. The Main bar in the front of the casino was slow. Waited a long time for drinks but the cocktail girls on the casino floor were quick and nice. Front desk staff was pleasant. Ask for a free upgrade for a room with a view. Pool area nice with palm trees. Too cold to swim but there were fire pits. Casino is close to MGM and New York New York. Lots of visible security Will stay again. (One strange thing did happen...when I was cashing my Owl Rewards in, the guy waiting on me passed out and fell back and hit his head on the counter behind him. The female staff member standing to his left didn't even flinch. I was \"Hey this guy just passed out\" she said \"It's happened before. \" Very non-chalant. The other employee working the desk on the other side of the guy who passed out called security. It took forever for someone to come and the whole time, this guy is on the floor, glasses broken, eyes closed and not one person had bent down to help him or even check to see if he has swallowed his tongue or if his head was bleeding. Very freaky....I was scared for this guy. He finally sat up when security came and he seemed okay. The ambulance arrived as we were getting in our cab. I sure hope he's okay.

Although the building it has gone thru some serious changes I can honestly say i was not impressed. It all depends on what you are looking for, in my honest opinion and in comparison to the other hotels it looks tired and run down. As all my other reviews, as long as the bed is clean and an hot water is available I am happy and since i got a great deal thru expedia I cannot complaint. However if you are used to more formal and structured hotels and resorts I do not recommend it. Having worked in the Hotel industry it can be a bit of a shocker as there is no formal lobby. The reception area is flushed to the left and not visible as the casino floor is immediately in front of it, I figured that the check in agents would have been HOOTER girls, sadly it wasnt, far from being hooter girls, there is plenty of then in the casino but none behind the front desk. (guess it would be too sexist) None the less like i said the room was good size, the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom spacious. (safe in the room and iron and ironing board) Never took advantage of the pool since it was too cold to enjoy outdoor activities but looked good from my bedroom window. Only complaint i have is that the housekeeper forgot to take out the trash on the first day, and the hostess of the restaurant was miserable, we got there at 12:35 pm to go for breakfast on Sun morning and she did not even look up, all she said was that the buffet was cleared and when we pointed out the info in the elevator all she said was that they were old and have not been updated, but apart her everyone else was pleasant. I will recommend this place as long as you are not looking for fancy decor, fine dinning, if you are in the mood for a good burger w/ fries, chicken wings and a cold beer its awesome! as long as you are willing to share the room with 21 yr old frat boys out to play....lol", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbus, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cCheap place to stay\u201d", "Author": "dukegirl", "ReviewID": "UR25866897", "Content": "My husband and I have stayed at this hotel and it was pretty nice for the price so we decided to stay again because it was so cheap.

The furniture mimics the Hooters resturant, with the orange lamps and official Hooters magazine on the desk with suggestively posed Hooters girls throughout it. Although advertised as Floridan style, the fake palm tree and bedspread were probably the nicest attractions in the rooms. The artwork is guy related with Hooters bar paintings and boats. Stains litter the hallway and bedroom rugs. One of my plug outlets didn't work, and although Hooters website says coffee makers are included in the room you have to request it. I requested mine 5 times over the course of 2 days, 4 times by phone and 1 time at the main desk. You can hear everyone's conversations as you walk by their rooms.

Basically, if you want a very slim chance of winning with no money invested and still receive drink service, this is not a bad promo. I got pretty good drink service here, but my husband really went through the money and had a hard time finding a waitress to get him a drink once he was done with the promo.

To keep costs down we decided to stay at hooters hotel as they gave us the 5th night for free. I waited all year to go on the trip to Vegas and in terms of my expectations to be honest I was expecting to simply sleep at Hooters and not really do anything else there. I didnt expect anything from this place at all, maybe it was unfair to jugde before I got there. After a Long and mingin flight, when the plane finally landed at the airport you could see the hotel which certainly didnt look to impressive due to the fact you have the monster of the MGM Grand directly behind it. But the look form the outside should not be taken into account as it is inside where the Hotel really impressed me and was well beyond my expectations when I booked. The Main floor has a decent sized Casino complete with Roulette, craps, Blackjack, poker and good selection of Slots to gamble 11 months worth of savings away, GET IN. The rooms are clean i'd probly compare them to a Travel Inn or Travelodge or similar back in the UK. The rooms are themed in a tropical style with a good selection of TV channels, a good sized bathroom with powerful shower, a electronic safe (crucial so you dont take your full wedge out with you and blow it on Black on the roulette). The only downside was our view as we got the airport, but to be honest it wasnt load enough to wake you as the airport seems busier in the day anyway, but if you are a plane spotter this room would be great for you. But again I didnt go Vegas to look out me room and admire the view, i went up the stratosphere for that. The hotel has a good sized pool area with an outdoor pool bar. The food and drink facilities were also better than expected here with A Dan Marinos Restaurant, a hooters and a couple of bars including the notorious dixies country bar with its $1 Bud light drafts and free for birds between 7-10pm wednesday and thursday. If you are going to vegas on budget I would certainly recommend this Hotel, it offers a good room in a good location to access the Strip and others hotels. I certainly would stay here again in the future. If you are going with a group of lads or a younger crowd of people this would be a great place to stay.

This was a pure mental health trip as we both needed a break from work and kids and\u2026you name it! Las Vegas has a good way of balancing things out for us. This trip however, presented a new challenge for us\u2026Vegas on a budget! Cash was a little tight for this trip, so we split gas with some friends and found a killer deal on a hotel. Hooters Hotel and casino presented the perfect opportunity. As travel professionals, we managed to get the room at half the usual weekend rate. That brought the price down to $100.00 for the weekend, can\u2019t argue with that. The d\u00e9cor at the hotel can most readily be described as a type of \u201cSpring Break\u201d atmosphere. Amidst the gambling tables and machines is a very welcoming beach atmosphere complete with decorative surfboards, grass skirt style paneling on the walls, palm trees and a beach concert style stage with dance floor. Not particularly incredible to look at, as compared to neighboring hotels, but not bad at all. For the money we paid as well as the money they asked for, I\u2019d say it was well worth it. Of course there were the \u201cHooters girls\u201d walking around in their tank tops and short shorts, but all done very tastefully, nothing scandalous. That surprised me a bit, I though Hooters in Las Vegas would be way over the top on the T & A scale, but it was very low key and subtle. There\u2019s still plenty of flesh to feast your eyes on if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after! The rooms were really interesting. The presentation itself follows the rest on the hotel in that Spring Break feel. They\u2019re very warm and basic, giving the feel of a beach house with bamboo trim on the walls and a hardened wicker cabinet for the TV. The bathroom was standard size, nothing special, however they do provide perhaps the best hotel soap I\u2019ve ever used. It didn\u2019t leave your skin felling strange at all, very soft. Everything else about the room was great. No bad smells, everything was clean as a whistle, plenty of toiletry items and not a bad view of the pool area. The elevators may be a little scary for you claustrophobics out there. They were very tight and a little shaky, no big deal though. My girl got a little worried, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to fall are we?\u201d She\u2019s a crack up\u2026 The restaurants were pretty good. Nothing fancy, just what you might expect from a building with the Hooters logo all over it, nice bar and grill atmosphere. The food was really good and moderately priced. The thing that sticks out most in my mind was the fact that their restaurant was open all night. This was perfect after it was too late to venture out and things were closing up. It would have been a long walk from where Hooters is to get to our favorite eateries. Having a 24 hour spot at the hotel that didn\u2019t cost and arm and a leg came in handy more than once. This may have been the perfect place to have a low budget Vegas trip without sacrificing the action of being on the strip. Hooters still boasted an on-strip location making things accessible. We had a lovely time without breaking the bank and we didn\u2019t have to stay in a dump either. I\u2019d certainly recommend Hooters for anyone looking to do Vegas on a modest budget and still be close enough to the action to not have to drive everywhere.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Myrtle Beach, SC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Inexpensive\u201d", "Author": "myrtlebeachgirl_8", "ReviewID": "UR22555414", "Content": "Stayed for four weeknights at the Hooters Casino Hotel in Las Vegas in the bungalows which is what we asked for.

Had one small maintenance issue and they came in 10 minutes to fix it. Parking there is easier than most of the very large hotels. Pools are very nice too. If you want luxury like Bellagio or Wynn, this is not the place for you. We get up around 10 or 11 and stay out till midnight or later so as long as the room is clean and fairly comfortable we are fine with it. Would have liked another chair beside the one in the room and maybe a small table, but not complaining. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable.

We ate the 25 cent wings after midnight one night in Dan Marino's and that was just fine too. There was never any line at the front desk if we needed anything. Heard horror stories at some of the others just about trying to check in at the huge places.

It would have been nice and some hotels do this even though they charge for internet access, they let you print up your boarding passes free.

I thought all a long this deal is too good to be true, and Hooters is going to be a let down. I read some pretty poor reviews, and expectations where certainly not high. But all I wanted was a roof over my head, a clean room, and some reasonable food and service. Firstly the location. I knew it was near to the MGM grand, which is huge, but right on the strip. You are literally 5 minutes walk away from the main strip and have good access to New York New York, MGM, Excalibur and many more hotels. It cost us just $12 from the Airport to the Hotel, and you can see it as you land. Secondly, the staff. 99% of the time great. Everyone was very friendly, and more so with it being Thanks Giving. I find some of the reviews people left saying the staff where moody and bad is probably a reflection on the reviewers personality. The staff where great with me and my friends, always a good morning, and always offering assistance. There was the odd one who was a bit moody, but you get that everywhere. Also on the staff, the Hooters girls got progressively better as the week went on. The girls in Dixies where just phenomenal to look at, and again, very friendly. Food and Drink was very well placed, like it was in most of Vegas. $4 for American beers, and $1 draught at night in Dixies is great value. Even with the weak pound to dollar. We ate in the Hooters restaurant one night, and again, service was great, and the food very good. The room was much more than I expected. We had clean towels every day, a reasonable selection of TV, and it was clean and tidy. Some people must have got a dodgey room, because mine was spot on the mark. If I had one complaint is that you get a 50/50 of what your view is. One side is the strip, one side is Motel 6 and the Airfield. Shame that, but did you come to Vegas to look out your window?! No, the real reason we went to Vegas was to gamble. And while you want to big it up in the big casino's, Hooters is a great place to start and end the night. And as said earlier, the location is spot on near the strip, and near the monorail stations into the middle of the strip also. Overall, did I expect a lot? No. Did it go beyond the expectations? Yes. I would have no problem recommending Hooters to friends, and I would have no problem staying myself their again. The only reason I wouldn't is so that I could see the rest of the fine hotels in Vegas, but when I return if I don't stay at Hooters, I will certainly pay a visit.", "Date": "December 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hereford", "Title": "\u201cCrap time Hooters style\u201d", "Author": "retiredplodabroad", "ReviewID": "UR22220930", "Content": "Having been to Vegas several times, we have never been let down by our hotel standard, not the very top of the range but good, Stratosphere & Sahara.

We had an interconnecting door, so all in 622 could be heard! At some point early morning, 3 am, in 620 either someone was having a ride to heaven or the adult movie was on loud. The walls are so thin, unbelievable.Breakfast another bad experience $9.99, but watch out, juices, toast etc extra. The basic breakfast was a poor selection, but then again it was $9.99! Service was poor, being held waiting for seating when the place was nearly empty was a joke.Waiting staff, bar one lady, was dreadfull, no tips there.The whole place was well below par in every respect. To add insult on check out, we were OK, but our friends were handed a bill for drinks they never had. Someone had charged a large round of 9 Buds & prawn cocktails to their room No. Obviously bar staff did not care to check validty of the order.

We stayed there again last Saturday, September 20th. This time we didn't. The deterioration was unbelievable. It's pretty obvious that employees really don't care about the facility. The hotel hallways and room carpets were black with dirt. You even saw dirt tracks permanently in the carpeting from luggage. I don't believe they have ever washed the carpets. The maintenance in the rooms were nil. Our bathroom had multiple mold and rust stains, missing shower curtain rings, toothpaste on the front of the sink, dirt in the crevices of the bathroom floor. The room had filthy carpeting and stuck taped paper/toilet paper on the wall over the bathroom door. You couldn't miss it so I find it hard to understand how it could still be there. If you end up in room 839, look up! The slot machine promo is truly a joke as others have said. There are approx 12 machines that are roped off. You stand in line to push a button on a $2.00 machine and you only have 3 winning combinations. I also never saw anyone win anything. I actually won 50.00 in coins which added to my total but I was not allowed to cash out because it was not one of the 3 winning combinations they designated. The comedian was also worthless. Several people walked out of the program out of disguist. Old jokes...I definitely recommend he find some new material. Heard it all before. They could easily upgrade this facility to make it liveable but apparently chose not to. New carpeting, new paint, employ friendly people who take pride in doing a good job. One highlight - the band in Dixie's, the Country and Western Bar, that night. They were amazing and I don't even like CW Music. But, don't stand at the bar. You'll stick to the floor. I walked right out of my shoes the floor was so sticky. My husband and I got a chuckle out of that. Again, we have always loved Hooters Restaurants and plan our vacations around them all over the world. We have a Hooters wall in our bar at home. But, they've really lost it at this facility. They need to make some real changes to bring it back to the standards that make it resideable. It's too bad....we loved it the first time.

The front desk folks were friendly and fast to check us in. The casino/hotel itself is a remodeled older place, but clean enough.

Beds and restroom were perfectly acceptable. The pool was large and had a fun atmosphere going on. We did join the players club and 1 of the 4 of us actually won $50 for the free slot play.

Those that don't spend much time in their room or have relatively low expectations will LOVE this steal of a hotel. Hotel snobs should look elsewhere. Also, skip the breakfast buffet which was sub-par. You can get much better food elsewhere for the same cost. Play the 25 cent video poker/blackjack at the bar at the back of the casino.

My visit was the weekend of 19-20 June, 2008. I traveled alone, for a reunion and retirement ceremonies for my military unit. The price was $109 per night for the two weekend nights. For the location, this was a very good price. Hooters is about 200 yards from the busiest intersection in Las Vegas, where the Strip intersects Tropicana Blvd. Walking was easy from one property to another; there are pedestrian walkways above the street, for all four possible street crossings. I did not use the $20 bill trick, because the room did not matter. *Remember, when you do tip the desk clerk at check-in, be ready to ask for what you want! \"Pool View\", \"Quiet Room\", \"Strip View\" or \"Upgrade\" are the common requests, here. My room was in the taller, Ocean Tower, 16th floor. The window faced the Strip-Tropicana intersection. This made for a fabulous view! I left the drapes open all night, so that I could see the Strip at any time. The view was clear enough to read the signs and watch the Manhattan Express roller coaster at the New York, New York Hotel. The room was fine. It was a major upgrade from similar rooms when the hotel was the San Remo. It had a tropical (Florida?) motif, and solid wood accents were throughout the room. The AC was fine, the bed was king-sized, and the bathroom was fine. The small casino was always active, and there were always plenty of orange shorts around. The table games are tighter than you can get elsewhere. WARNING: think twice before accepting the \"Free $100 in Slot Play\". You may have to stand in a long line to play a specific machine. The people in line looked like they were suffering, and those at the machines seemed to be just \"getting it over with\". There were constant elevator problems. Only one lift was available for the entire Ocean Tower. When this is the case, the hotel should open the stairs doors, so the more fit patrons can move quickly! Don't lose your precious Vegas time waiting for a lift! The parking garage is nice, and Valet was quick(only used once). I was confused about breakfast options; it wasn't until I got home that I found out that Marino's had a breakfast buffet. I'm sure I missed it somewhere in the Services booklet, but it needs to be posted prominently. Marino's is a steakhouse; a guest will not immediately assume that there is breakfast there. I always left in the mornings. There is a naughty-girl vibe about the Hooters. Surprisingly, a large percentage of the clientele is young females, who seem to enjoy the \"I am allowed to dress like this, here\" idea. This is not for me. To me, it is about table games. Personally, I prefer the downtown hotels. They are all adjacent, and the canopy protects walkers from the heat. The 4Q is larger and cleaner, at about 1/3 of the price. I invite readers to read my reviews of Golden Gate and ElCortez, which are two of my favorites. I wouldn't mind returning to the Hooters, but there are other choices.

The elevator was slow and reminded me of an old elevator I rode in a Hungarian hotel a few years ago. More importantly, no coffee pot in the room. A full pot of coffee delivered to the room by room service was about $21.00. That was really lame. Getting coffee in the morning was a hassle and expensive ( I think about $3.00 a cup downstairs in the crowded gift shop. The bed was comfortable and the room was reasonably clean, albeit small, poorly lit and drab. The windows were filthy and hard to look out of. The air conditioner worked OK. I found this room to have less than average storage (drawers or places for my stuff). A TV armoire with a broken shelf was about it, with the exception of a standard motel closet with about 8 hangers. The room did have an electronic safe that worked.. I did not have any encounters with hotel staff. All in all, it was not a bad value, but nothing to write home about. I expected a cleaner, more well maintained property.

I was travelling with my cousin for a friends wedding the following day. Before arriving I was slightly concerned reading some of the previous reviews but there was no need to be worried. We checked in about 3am with no problems whatsoever. The elevator/hall ways were clean and had a very clean smell about them, I was dreading getting a terrible room as this would have just put the icing on the cake for us after an horrific journey but the room was way above our expectations. A huge room with 2 queen beds two tables separate dressing table with well lit mirror. very large closet and tv. The bathroom was a very good size too. Everywhere appeared spotlessly clean. The best part was actually getting into the most comfiest bed I have slept in! We were on the second floor of the Ocean Tower which had a pool view, this was blocked partially as we were on a low floor but that didn't matter one bit as we were hardly in the room during the day anyway. We had no problems with hearing noise from adjoining rooms. Once we had caught up on a couple of hours sleep we ventured downstairs for a look around, there was a small but cozy pool area with a pool bar, A 'Bait' shop selling souvenirs, drinks and snacks etc, there was two bars in the casino and three restaurants (obviously one was a Hooters!), we tried out the Dan Marino's Restaurant for breakfast which was delicious, good selection for a good price, especially the buffet for just under $10, unfortunately I never got to go to Hooters as the queue was always so long! All of the staff were EXTREMELY helpful and friendly, we wanted to spend a day shopping and enquired about buses and taxis to various places, after chatting with two of the bell hops (I didn't get there names unfortunately) we ended up hiring a car for the day which prob saved us a fortune in fares and a lot of time so meant we could do more shopping!! We were picked up right outside the front entrance by the car hire company and taken to their depot where our 'economy car' was waiting for us. I was expecting a very small car but it was a huge Chrysler Sebring so I guess we were upgraded. We also booked tickets to see 'an evening at Le Cage' a show at the riviera, we were able to do this throught the hotel and again the guy (an oldish gentleman) was very helpful and advised us of timings and stuff to make sure we got the best seats. The location of hooters is perfect, it's literally a 5 min walk from the strip, it's right opposite the MGM which also has a monorail stop so handy for that as well. The only fault I could find was that the ice machine wasn't working on our floor so we had to use the one upstairs but I would hardly say that's a problem or inconvenience. People have complained on here about not getting towels or bedding changed, there are little cards in the room explaining about helping save the environment and only having the bed changed if you really needed it, if you did all you had to do was place the card on the bed and they would do this, as quite a 'green' person myself I was quite happy with this. The pool area got very very busy with the younger crowd on a weekend with a live DJ playing very live music so not ideal if you are wanting a relaxing sunbathe. This was my fifth visit to vegas and i've stayed in different places each time, this is definitely one of the best values for money. Some friends were staying at the bellagio and we went to see there room and to be honest it wasn't all that it's cracked up to be (for what they paid I would have expected a lot more) and there was a really bad smell in the corridors!

Arrival We flew to LA from London and drove straight to Vegas that night, meaning that by the time we reached the City, we were shattered - so hoped for no issues at check in. We weren't disappointed. The guy on the desk called up our details straight away and directed us to our to twin rooms in the 'Tower'. You enter the hotel through the casino, so are immediately greeted with the sights and sounds of Vegas - and of course, the site of the Hooters girls. The Room The rooms were clean, tidy and well decorated. There is an overall 'beach' style to the place which is no bad thing. The room had two queen sized beds, a decent sized TV, a desk and (crucially) good air conditioning. The bathroom was a touch dated, but clean and had no issues. We were on a lower floor, so our outlook was a flat roof with air con ducts, but also the MGM Grand opposite. Our friends' room was poolside - but again, too low to see the pool over the flat roof! Still, if you are coming to Vegas to sit looking out your hotel room window, you might want to rethink your destination! Facilities We didn't use the restaurants in the hotel, but they were always busy which is usually a good sign. The bar by the pool was nice, and a good place to stand around sipping cool beer. We used the casino a few times and liked it a lot. Far less pretentious than the big Strip casinos and good fun. Location Great location. Just off the strip, but literally across the road from the MGM Grand, so not far away. We did a couple of day trips - Lake Mead for example - and the hotel was the right end of town to drive there. Big car park so no problems there. Any problems? Vegas is a 24x7 city and as such, you have to accept that there will be times when there will be noise at times that anywhere else would be unacceptable. After our 23.00 arrival from LA, we checked in and then hit the strip, returning at 3am. At 5am, what sounded like 40 girls (but was probably only 8-10 of them) arrived back to the room next door and made a lot of noise for an hour or so. This was all the more of an intrusion due to there being a (locked!) adjoining door between our rooms. Overall An excellent hotel, in an excellent location.

Opened the window and had a great view of the south strip. Window was gross though. The worst part of the room was the A/C unit. It was as old as dirt and when we turned in on it made this horrible grinding noise. We laughed at everything wrong with the hotel though because we knew it was going to be tacky. The A/C was really a pain though trying to sleep. When we slept we just turned on the vent because it didn't make that noise until you hit the COOL button. Lo and behold in the middle of the night somehow the COOL came on (no one touched it) and the grinding noise wouldn't stop and we literally could not get the unit to go off. We pushed the OFF button several times and nothing. It just stayed on, even when we left for check out it was still on. The staff here acts like they go out of their way for you but they don't. None of them have nice Hooters either, believe me I looked. The $300 in slot play you get isn't worth it. You're only allowed to play on the designated machines they have. Also check out is at 10AM and housekeeping will come to let you know. They were knocking on our door at 8:45AM to ask if we needed help getting our things together to check out. This hotel is OK if you're on a REALLY tight budget (or just spend the extra $20 a night and get a cheap room at Excalibur). But I wouldn't stay here again and quite frankly, I'm glad this place is getting sold and closed.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Missouri", "Title": "\u201cwow...WORST.

We stopped by shortly after midnight for their 25 cent Hooter's wings special. Being a big fan of Hooter's wings, I ordered 20 and was expecting to have a great late-night meal. Wrong! When the wings arrived they had a pale, sickly look to them. They were drenched in grease and had minimal breading on them. On top of this, they were almost cold. As a guy who can devour almost anything no matter what it tastes like, I figured it didn't really matter what they would taste like as long as they filled me up. Well, after my first bite I almost vomited in my mouth. Keep in mind that I have NEVER turned down a meal before and I am NOT a picky eater. The taste of the wings was indescribable...something along the lines of 2 week old dead roadkill (perhaps a possum) drenched in greasy raw sewage. Disgusting. The crazy thing is that I was actually able to eat 3 of them in the half-hour we were there. We were placing bets on me eating all 20, but those would have to be the worst odds in Vegas. Everyone at my table had an identical experience. In total, we ordered 80 wings and only ate 6 of them. Not wanting to start anything, we just paid our bill and got the heck out of there. A short trip down the street to McDonalds and I was in heaven...it tasted like a 5 star restaurant in comparison. I have sworn off Hooter's completely at this point. I will never eat there again.

This was our 13th trip to LV and we'll definately stay here again. We both travel a ton, so if you're looking for THE Hotel or Bellagio Lite, this isn't for you. However, if you want a mix of the islands + LV - this is the place. Our first room was too near the dumpster which was emptied at about 5am - what a wake up call - haha - so we asked for a room change and received one without too much hassle, though it wasn't ready until later in the day, the desk staff when I did change rooms was fantastic and really funny. The entire staff was friendly, fun, and unlike other places actually seemed to be enjoying what they were doing and making a sincere effort to make the guests feel welcome -- Sorry, Harrah's - you're \"scripting\" of employees falls short, we'd rather get at \"HEY! You're Back!\" at the end of a fun day than some fake scripted \"Hello Mrs. Decker, how was your day, Mrs. Decker, can I assist you, Mrs. Decker\" any day. (We both have backgrounds in hospitality and I worked in Casino gaming for 9 years...) Two musts: One - find Manny -- he's one of the few male bartenders - and worth a visit in his own right. If you're tired of LV bartenders who don't know how to actually tend bar (i.e. scan their bar, remember your drink, and make you feel like you're a regular at some local watering hole) - he's your guy! While I'm sure he could do the dog and pony show of tossing bottles and flaming drinks, he's more interested in making sure you feel welcome and swapping a good story or two. So go say hey to Manny, leave him a nice tip, and chill out for a bit between gambling rounds. Second Must: Hang with the day time dice crew - some of these folks have been with the property for over a decade. They are real dealers who not only know the game, but have all the funny lingo down, and run a perfect pace at the table. You won't feel hurried or feel like a nap between rolls. Also unlike other houses that sweat the money - the crew and the box congratulated winners, with real enthusiasm and cheers and also gave newer players good betting information and were overly gracious when they were tipped or were put on the line with odds (don't cheap out folks, if you're going to put the crew on the line, play the odds for them) They regularly engaged players in fun conversation, talk of March Madness, and inquired whether people were having fun. Huh. They seem to \"get it\", don't they??? We had a blackjack dealer that \"couldn't lose\" - but his personality and repeated yelling to the floor \"get me out of here\" was hilarious. You know the place is running well when the floor came over and started yelling \"Bust, come on dealer, bust\". Too funny. Overall the service was fantastic, the beverage service is probably the best in Vegas - it was very personal, speedy, and tips were received with real gratitude. Note, too that each bartender we encountered made a great bloody mary - which is a big deal for us! If you're a rated player somewhere else and tired of feeling like a number or that your play isn't appreciated, call Faye, one of the hosts, and consider giving Hooters your business. As a woman, I can honestly attest to the fact that the \"Rack Pack\" is brilliant marketing - and funny - and while they ladies are, I'm sure, lovely to look at, they also have great attitudes and treat all players - regardless of gender or tipping level like kings and queens. And yes, they do have $5 tables and all the games. Their \"light up\" roulette tables are very cool, and all the dealers on that game we encoutered were teriffic. I think overall the best thing about Hooters was that people were having fun and there was great energy in the casino just about all the time. There were people in their 80's sitting next to college kids and everyone was having fun. Even though it was \"spring break\" season we didn't feel as though it was a \"frat\" atmosphere, and the extremely personable and interactive Security Staff - especially by the pool - made a huge effort to interact with everyone and develop a relationship so that if one of the guests did go a little \"over the line\" he or she was humored and teased back into good behavior. So, in summary, give it a try. If you're looking for a fun place that doesn't take itself too seriously and understands that it's the overall experience as much as the win/lose statement this may be what you've been looking for!", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cIt is what it is\u201d", "Author": "HoopKing", "ReviewID": "UR14657108", "Content": "Was in Las Vegas for March Madness so knew I would not be spending a lot of time at the Hotel. Hooter's met my needs perfectly and then some !! I was traveling alone with various friends coming in for the games. I had buddies staying at the Luxor, MGM, and NY NY so we were all close by. I have stayed at each of the other 3 plus the Rio and Bally's on past Vegas excursions. I can honestly say that the stay at Hooter's was probably my most pleasant stay in Las Vegas. Since I was by myself, my needs were minimal but they were surpassed. I probably wouldn't have stayed here if traveling with my wife, but after this experience I would. The location is great - 5 minute walk and you're at the Tropicana/Las Vegas BLVD intersection. You are 5 minutes from the MGM monorail station. The price I paid was insane to be so close to all of this action. As for the property itself, again I was presently surprised. The check in process was a snap and extremely friendly staff. I had a 5th floor room in the Bay View tower that had a good view of MGM/Monte Carlo - a little balcony that you could stand on and let in some fresh air - something that is rare in Vegas. Past complaints of old bathrooms are accurate - if you want a posh bathroom - look elsewhere and be willing to double your price. If you are using the bathroom to shower, dispose of waste and brush your teeth - this place will suffice. The room was comfortable and the bed was very nice. The place was clean and maid service was prompt and thorough. As for the rest of the place, I didn't spend a lot of time in the casino. I like craps and they had only one table going and makes it hard to get hot. I spent most of my time in the MGM and Mandalay Bay gambling but that is what my plan was coming in. I thought the dealers were friendly when I did gamble and it was pretty lively. The pool area was pleasant and there were quite a few spring breakers partying in that area, but everybody seemed to be getting along and having a good time. I ate lunch at Hooters twice and dinner at Marino's twice and had no issues at either place. The filet I had at Marino's rivaled those at Austin's, The Palm and other places that would cost twice as much. Bottom line - my experience was great. I'd definitely recommend it to those of you that know what you're getting in to. It is not Ceasar's, Mandalay Bay or the Bellagio.

They make your time at the table fun and entertaining, no matter whether you're winning or losing. I've played at other casinos and the dealers are very impersonal.

We got a rate of $65/night average and booked knowing that we would be spending very little time in our room. With that in mind I'll try to include little tips and tricks we found while there. Our room was fantastically hideous with the orange and greens. The beds were advertised as queen (I was told this never confirmed it) and they were at best full size. We used the beds for probably 6 hours the entire trip so again not a big deal to us but if you enjoy soft, big, comfortable beds this place is not for you. We had a view of the pools which would have been great if they were in use. The hot tubs were going strong 24/7. The casino itself is small in comparison to those nearby. However during our stay we always found it easy to find a table to jump on, and the minimums varied from $5-10 for BJ, Roulette, and Craps. The dealers were very friendly and attractive. We all agreed that the casino topped all of the ones we went to in terms of attractive, nice, flirtatious dealers. They definitely made the experience more enjoyable. If you go make sure to sit down if Kari or Kellie are dealing, they are extremely fun to play the game with. We only ate at the hotel once, and we chose Dan Marino's for breakfast. The buffet was only $8.95, and did the trick of getting a decent meal in us. The buffet includes eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns, fruits, and cereal. No biscuits and gravy which was disappointing. We did attempt an extremely late night/early morning visit back to DM but was told there was a wait (funny b/c there was noone in the place). Overall the hotel met our needs, and we did gamble quite a bit in the casino. Most of us found the slots to be pretty loose and more than half came out ahead while in the casino. One last note I had been to Vegas a couple years ago and used the \"Tickets 4 Tonite\" service. Basically it just offered show tickets for half price the day of showing. What I found this time was that dinner and golf greens fees are now also available. If you plan to play golf definitely check this place out! We didn't bring our clubs and we were sorely disappointed as we could've gotten a fantastic rate. Also note that we did a Treasures package that included dinner. What it entailed was for $3 each (yes $3) we got a complimentary limo, no cover charge, and half priced dinner. We were told there was no catch, and there wasn't. The dinner was below average, go somewhere else for a good steak dinner. Look for the Fat Tuesdays around the strip. There are 5 locations (one in Planet Hollywood, one in MGM) and they offer several different sizes and flavored frozen drinks (margaritas, etc) for reasonable prices. For example I chose the 46 oz. margarita and paid $11 for one, then refilled it for $8 the rest of the time. Compare that to one drink at $7-9 unless you're gambling of course, and that paid for itself easily. Slots - played quite a few and found the wheel of fortunes in the round with the gigantic wheel in the center to be by far the loosest. We played in NYNY, PH, Monte Carlo, Flamingo, and Palms and every time hit for at least $50. It is well worth it (note find the machines that have the max. bet set at 15 credits not 80). Played Wizard of Oz and Top Gun and was extremely disappointed in the pay out. Lasted 5 minutes max on each. Hooters Hotel/Casino is what we thought it would be, and if you book knowing what you're going to get how can you be disappointed.

The \"fix\" was done while I was out that day and when I took my next shower, the standing water was \"only\" up to my ankles not half way up my shin.

One tiny gripe though, the sheets seemed to be made of polyester or something and were not all that comfortable. Check-in was a breeze, the staff was friendly, the other guests were courteous, and I really liked staying in a smaller place where you don't have to walk a mile to get anywhere. location is its best feature, right next to the Tropicana and MGM Grand, and within walking distance of the middle of the strip. Being right on Tropicana also makes for a very quick trip to the airport and easy driving if you have a car. I also liked that we could park right near the casino in a lot instead of having to navigate a parking garage. The pool area is small but nicely done, definitely geared more toward sitting around than swimming. I will say though that I was not impressed with the Hooters casino. It's very small, and what few tables they have start at $10 and are mostly novelty poker games and the horrible 6:5 Blackjack. Cocktail service is almost nonexistant.

I'm a Diamond Total Rewards member and usually stay at Caesars, Paris or one of the other Harrahs establishments, but I've also stayed at Circus, Circus (one night . . . NEVER again), Stratosphere, Sahara, Venetian, Monte Carlo, Golden Nugget, and a few of the non-casino hotels. A year or so ago I went to Hooters to play blackjack. Although I left with a lot more money than I brought, I left with a bad impression. The parking lot was old and creepy, the casino seemed to be dark and smokey, the tables were packed too close together, and with a couple of exceptions, the dealers seemed unfriendly. I recently received an offer that I decided to use to add onto a trip I had planned at Paris for last week. I'm glad that I did. I had a great experience. First, the room was exceptional for a budget casino. My room was a suite, and althought it obviously wasn't as big or as nice as a suite at Caesars or Paris, it was nicely decorated, exceptionally clean, and the quality was much better than I expected. I wouldn't decorate my house the same way, but it had a casual and comforable warmth that was a uniqe change. I would easily choose that room over many of the rooms I've gotten at other hotels. I also had a strip view from the 19th floor, which was nicer than the view I've had at most Las Vegas hotels. But the most pleasant surprise was that the casino seemed to be warmer and friendlier than I experienced on my first trip. Either my first experience was exaggerated negatively, or they've made improvements that result in less crowded space, brighter lights, and less stuffiness. Most importantly, the dealers were a lot of fun. After playing blackjack at the stuffy Bally's and Paris casinos, the Hooters atmosphere was a refreshing change. The hotel check in was a breeze. The staff was efficient and there were no lines. I also never had a wait at the cashier's window. Although Hooters is at the end of the strip, it's an easy walk to the monorail and a reasonable walk to the middle of the strip. One of the nicest features is the proximity to the airport. I've had cab rides from Ceasar's and Paris that run as high as $25 and take a half hour due to long waits in traffic. From Hooters the fare was $7.10, or $10 with a tip, and took aboaut 5 minutes. We ate hamburgers at the Hooters restaurant and had ribs at Dan Marinos. Both experiences were great, both in terms of the quality of the food and the service. There were a couple of negatives. As pointed out in other reviews, the hallways need to be upgraded. The carpet is dull and worn, and the walls need help. They caused me to worry as I walked to my room. I also had to wait too long in the player's club line. The first wait was between 45 minutes and an hour, and the second was about a half hour. Overall, my stay at Hooters was one of the best experiences that I've had in Las Vegas, or in any other casino, for that matter.

The rooms are remodeled and attractive. There were no bad smells which I have experienced in non-smoking rooms in other Vegas hotels. The beds were very comfortable. The comforter and pillows were pretty, however after looking closer at the matching decorative bed pillows, we noticed small stains that appeared to be blood on them. Yuck! A few stains on the carpet but not enough to make a big deal of. The bathroom - needs work. The toilet barely flushed half the time. We were scared it was going to overflow. The tubs appear old and the drainage is slow but all in all, it's adequate. The Dam Restaurant and Dan Marino Restaurant were both very good with great service. Nobody in our group won anything at the casino although it was a nice comfortable size and not too smokey. The two gift shops offer some great unique Hooters gifts and they stay open quite late to make it easier to shop after the night out.

We found the employees to be very friendly and it is in a great location. We had an enjoyable time until 5 minutes before we checked out. More on that later. We are among the unfortunate few who stayed at this hotel in recent years when it was still the San Remo. Based upon that, our expectations going in were very low. We were greeted by enthusiastic front desk people. Our \"Ocean Front\" room was spacious by Vegas standards, with a King size bed, desk, dressing area and bar table with stools. The bed was as comfortable as anything you'll find in more upscale hotels. The carpeting was stained in a few places, but otherwise, the room was clean with no offensive odors. The dressing mirror and counter was a nice touch, but there weren't any electrical outlets there. On the nearby desk, however, there was a powerstrip and computer connection. The bathroom was nice and again kept clean. We stayed three nights and the housekeepers did a nice job maintaining the room. For gamblers, there is a greater variety of table games than the casino offered when it first opened. The $10 minimums kept many of the Hooters clientele from gaming. Even on Friday and Saturday nights, you could find empty seats at the tables. The Casino Royale on the strip, with their lower table limits and liberal cocktail service, seems to cater more to the 21 to 35 year-olds that were staying at Hooters. The only hiccup came the morning we were checking out. Hooters has a 24 hour cafe called the DAM Restaurant. We arrived at 5:55 a.m. to eat breakfast. We were seated and the hostess put breakfast menus in front of us. We ordered two of the English Muffin breakfasts. The waitress said we couldn't have that because breakfast didn't start until 6:00. As we walked out, she apologized and asked if we could just wait five minutes. My question to her was, \"if you don't serve breakfast until 6, why give someone a breakfast menu?\" It's not like this is an inexpensive place. Their breakfast menu started at $8.95 and went up. We stayed here as part of a package and got a great deal.

We were traveling with a group of about 6 couples from WI. My husband and I were the first to arrive in Vegas and Hooters on 9/5/07. We had been on planes since 5am and it was now 2pm our time and it was HOT in Vegas. All I wanted to do was get a cold beer and change my clothes. Upon arrival they have brilliantly placed the bar right next to check-in. I was able to satisfy my first desire by ordering a cold beer. Check in was great. Easy and quick. Although, for some reason we got 2 double beds instead of a king. No biggee, me and the hubby will snuggle. We proceeded to our room 806 in the Bayview tower. The room sort of look like the pictures. The decorations were all what I expected. What I didn't expect were the stains on the carpet or the rust on the bathtub. There was also cracked, peeling paint on our bathroom walls. The view left a lot to be desired. We could see the back of MGM along with the exhaust fans on top of the Hooters roof and parking garage. Not much for an inspiring view. However, really for the price and it being Vegas I wasn't expecting a palace. Just something clean and functional. I immediately opened my suitcase and grabbed some cooler clothes. I went into the bathroom to change. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something scurry across the wall into the corner by the mirror. I looked closer to find an insanely large COCKROACH. First of all, I have never seen a live one. Second, I have never seen anything that big except on like the Discovery Channel. Disgusting!! I made my husband kill it. I am not a prude, though. One bug isn't going to scare me off. Although, now I was inspecting every nook and cranny of that room. I didn't find any of it's friends so we carried on and left to go to Downtown Las Vegas for the day. We returned late that evening and ordered room service. Room service was good and prompt. I took a shower that night. Which led to another discovery. My shower curtain had mildew all over it. I was so tired and so sweaty from the 100 degree heat I just didn't even care. I carefully washed up trying desperately to not let any body part make contact with the shower curtain. Gross!! The next morning I was walking around the carpet barefoot while we made plans for the day. I went to get dressed and put on my shoes. As I leaned over to put on my socks I noticed the bottoms of my feet. To my horror they were dirty and black. Did I mention I took a shower the night before? Yep, all I walked on that morning was the carpet in our hotel room. Puke!!! This was my final straw. I was now just grossed out by the uncleanliness of the place. I called the Manager, Wendy. I told her about the bug, shower curtain, and my feet. She seemed very calm and non-responsive. Even started telling me how yes, bugs in the desert are bigger. They seek out moisture and sometimes come in through the vents. I kept thinking, ok, but I am EIGHT floors up!! Also, why is she telling me this like it is something that is common. If I am customer service or a Manager at a hotel I would not want my guests to think there are more bugs. I would act completely appalled and tell them that is unheard of and apologize profusely. She finally asked if I would like to change rooms. She said the set of rooms I stayed in are not as nicely renovated as the Oceanview ones. She could change my room and the bellman could help us. We just had to do it before 6pm that night. We already had plans for the day and were about to walk out the door. I told her I would call her back and we would try to meet the 6pm deadline. Problem was, we had completely unpacked our suitcases. I told her if we didn't meet her deadline then at the bare minimum I would like my shower curtain replaced. I mean really is that all she could offer. To inconvenience us more by making us pack back up and now moving into another room basically identical to ours, but \"possibly\" in better shape. We ended up going out with our group of friends, having loads of fun on the strip, and did not get back until late. Past the 6pm deadline. However, we did notice our shower curtain had been changed by the cleaning service. What we also did was from the night before when we ordered room service was accidentally drop a french fry by our bed. We joked that morning about it and I said that would be my test to see if they cleaned it up. Yeah, it was still there. Beds were made. Towels and toiletries replaced, but that stupid french fry was still there. This became our gauge on how well the cleaning crew performed. Yep, that french fry never moved the entire 5 days we were there!!! I, personally, don't think they vaccum. I never saw a vaccum by one of the cleaning carts. I did see a man vaccuum the hallway once outside our door, but that was it. I also question whether they sweep the bathroom. I dropped a rubberband one morning and the next day it was still there. I think they simply change your towels, empty trash cans, give you toiletries, wipe the sink/tub, and call it a day. Even glasses and empty soda cans weren't thrown out for us. Like they thought we were going to the local recycler or something. I don't know. (??) In WI our hotels clean top to bottom. Maybe that isn't the norm in Vegas. No, that cannot be this is like our 6th time in Vegas and never have I seen such poor cleaning in a casino hotel. Especially a hotel that is realitively new to Vegas, has a well established brand, and is trying to make a name for itself as a Vegas strip hotel competitor. Unbelievable. Therefore, if you like creepy crawlers, black dirty feet, stained up carpets, and living in trash. By all means stay at Hooters. Its' cheap, but you have to be willing to comprimise on clean. Trust me your not getting any sort of Vegas Strip luxury hotel staying here. YIKES!! ** We took pictures. I am in process of getting them developed. I will post them as soon as I do. The only thing we missed was the bug. My husband killed it and flushed it down toilet before I could snap a picture. Seriously, it was the size of a walnut.

(with an air of aprehension) Well, I should have known better. My wife and I are fun, outgoing people and we had a terrible time at this property. First the pool area which is made out to be lavish is really a snooze fest (this may have been due to it being a weekday) but the worst part was they stop cocktail service almost as soon as the sun disappears around 4 pm. We like to go out for late afternoon swims, and as such if we wanted to enjoy a beverage we had to walk inside the Hooters restaurant to get a drink (where the service was incredibly slow, although the girls were very friendly, albeit not as attractive as we expected) The casino itself is small, with limited table game options, and lacking of the energy/atmosphere of most of the strip properties. We found the two pit bosses and non Hooters girl dealers we came in contact with to be cold, thus we didn't spend much time at the tables here. (the Hooters Dealers were much friendlier, and easier on the eyes) The rooms themselves (we upgraded to a suite) were ok, there was a 42 plasma in the living room, with a small bar area with a fridge (which kept drinks very cold). The beds were actually quite comfortable. That is where the good parts of the room ended. The windows looked as though they hadn't been cleaned since the San Remo days, they were like that scene from My Cousin Vinny (very, very dirty for those who can't recall), the carpets and couch were stained extensively, the soundproofing was non-existent. However all of these items could have potentially been overlooked if not for the showers. The room had two showers (which may have been nice) however there is something seriously wrong with their water tank/pressure system. In the course of a 10 minute shower, my wife and I would be routinely scalded and frozen in numerous intervals (we took 3 showers and this occured every time, to both of us) All in all, I guess given the price if we need a place to sleep, and they fixed the showers we may stay there again.

I feel very strongly that people need to know my version of the truth about this hotel. First of all, I would like to say that I have no complaints about the staff. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful. They were also very eager to compensate for our dissatisfaction. Upon arrival at the hotel, everything seemed fine. The reservations were correct (thank you Vegas.com). The room availability at the time of check in was either two queen beds or one king bed in the bungalows. A bungalow, overlooking the pool, sounds fun, huh?! We give our bags to the bellhop and head up to our room. The room was located outside of the hotel/casino structure. Walking through the pool area was a must to get to it. We opened the door to get in the building and immediately were taken aback by the smell in the hallway. It smelled just like a deep fryer, as my husband liked to say. I think it smelled more like someone had died! Being optimistic, we continue on to the room. We open the door. It is quite dingy and dark in the room. We stayed there for about an hour and a half until our luggage showed up at the room (we did have to call for it). Then we headed out to eat dinner (our first meal since breakfast)--over dinner we decide that we can't stay in the room. It was just too dirty for our standards. We go talk to the receptionist and she was very accommodating. She said in about an hour she would have a room for us with a king size bed in the ocean view rooms. We were excited about this! She comes and gets me in an hour and my husband and I gather our things from the old room and move them into the new room. We immediately attempt to turn on the air conditioning, and what luck would have it, it wasn't working! (las Vegas with no a/c--not going to happen!) Then I realize the sink in the room does not drain! We call for someone to come fix it. After 2 phone calls and 30 minutes later, the mechanic arrives. He fixes the a/c (thank God) and attempts to fix the sink. He used this contraption that forced air through the pipes to remove any clogs there might be. This device managed to spray dirty (leftover) sink water onto the mirror and counter space. The man doing the work used the room towels to haphazardly wipe up the mirror and sink. I do have to say, for the quick fix it did work for about 24 hours....then the sink went back to overflowing if the water was running too long. (we did not want to take the effort or our time to have someone come fix it) The following day (after being at the pool all day) we come back inside to shower and get ready for the evening. My husband showers first and then I hop in....while I'm in the shower the lights int he bathroom turn off!!! (not any other outlet or light in the entire room)--so I am condemned to taking a shower in the dark. With all of this aside the rooms (both of them) were filthy.

Decor in the casino and the room was typical of a Hooters restaurant with lots of orange vinyl and natural wood. A little jarring to look at compared to other luxurious hotels in Vegas, but it grows on you. If you are driving, the parking ramp is immediately adjacent to the hotel and access is very convenient. Driving in and out on Tropicana is a snap. Although technically off the strip, it is a 5 minute walk to Las Vegas Blvd from your hotel room. I have stayed at Bally's, Luxor, Harrahs, and other strip properties where it took longer just to get the elevator down. My room was in the \"Oceanview\" tower (used to be the silver tower when it was San Remo) and it was large, comfortable, clean, and exactly what I requested. The hallways and elevators are a little beaten and dreary, but the room itself was great. I arrived 2 hours early for Sunday check-in and they were able to give me the King/no-smoking room I requested. In contrast to older reviews I read here, all the staff I met seemed quite friendly and knowledgeable. Pool area was very lively and had a live reggae-type band playing on Sunday. I didn't see much cocktail service walking around, but service was fast at the pool bar. I thing large drafts were $5 and frozen drinks were $8 - $10. There were a lot of lounge chairs and benches surrounding the pools, and it seemed some were always open. The hooters restaurant has a porched area overlooking the pool where you can get food. Crowd was mostly couples in their late 20's - early 40's and not the drunken bachelor party group I was expecting, but it was a Sunday. Casino is a little small, but they have all the table games and a good variety of slots. I found 9/6 JOB video poker and decent pay tables on Dueces Wild. BJ was mainly $10 minimum . . . I never saw lower. There were a lot of 6/5 tables and the placards stating that are small, so look carefully before you sit down. Cocktail service was speedy wherever I was sitting. To summarize: This is a 3-star place with a really fun atmosphere and decent rooms, food, and gaming.

We took my father to Las Vegas as a Father\u2019s Day present and he stayed in room 853. Having never even dined at a Hooter\u2019s Restaurant and with my wife\u2019s apprehension about staying at a Hooter\u2019s establishment, we were both very pleasantly surprised and pleased with our accommodations. As I needed to purchase two rooms, price was a major factor in selecting Hooter\u2019s. I found a great deal on Expedia for only $33 a night! This was for a 3 star hotel that had a good ranking on TripAdvisor (no. 68 out of 240). The total price for two rooms for 3 nights plus fees and taxes was only $221.00. This was an extremely great value. To have stayed elsewhere on the strip at any decent hotel would have doubled the cost of the entire trip. I liked the location of the hotel as it was right across from a monorail stop at MGM Grand and down the street from a mini-mart. The elevators were all working and I usually did not have to wait long for one. We checked in at 2:00 pm and were able to secure rooms before the official check-in time of 3:00 pm. We only had to wait about 8-10 minutes to be checked in. We were given smoking rooms, but as a nonsmoker I could not detect the slightest odor of cigarette smoke in my room. Our room was very clean, spacious, and did not show any signs of age. I liked the nice touch of putting large plants in the room, but felt the wooden d\u00e9cor was a little tacky. The rooms had a nice view of the hotels on the southern part of the strip (Luxor, MGM Grand, Excalibur, and Tropicana). The television had a large selection of channels and was nicely positioned right in front of the bed. The bathroom was very clean and was of average size that came with all the usual amenities including a hair dryer and vanity mirror. The bed was very comfortable, but the air conditioner was a little noisy. I did not hear any noises from the adjoining rooms. The rooms were serviced every day, but some maids were a little too quick to open the door after knocking. The staff of the hotel was very polite and friendly. The drink service at the gaming tables and pool area was very good. I very much enjoyed the pool area, which had a lively atmosphere. There were two pools and two hot tubs. However, one of the hot tubs was cold all four days we stayed there. There were plenty of towels and security was always on guard. We ate at the Dam Restaurant for lunch. The food was good, but service poor. I heard some of the staff members state that the restaurant was reduced to a \u201cskeleton staff\u201d to save money, which has had a proportional impact on customer service. The prices were very affordable. I appreciated the fact that the casino table limits were as low as $10.00. I walked across the parking lot to play Blackjack at the Tropicana where table limits were as low as $5.00. Overall I very much enjoyed my stay and believe I got an excellent value for only $33 a night. I had stayed at the Hilton Hotel for my only other trip to Las Vegas and if given a choice between staying at one hotel or the other for the same price, I would choose Hooter\u2019s. Marc T.

If it were not for the convention in town and every other hotel booked we would have cancelled our reservations and moved to another hotel. Hooters hotel is also less then spectacular, the paint was peeling of the ceiling, the rooms were very small, and all of the little things you would come to expect from a hotel on the strip were no where to be found. Its as if they expect to thrive on name alone. If it came down to staying there again or canceling the trip I would cancel and look for another vacation spot. Pretty frustrating after coming home from serving my country in the middle east, expecting a relaxing vacation and having what should have been a wonderful time ruined by the horrible customer service of the hotel you are staying at. Never again will I return to this hotel and I tell everyone I know to avoid it, you should do the same.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "south bend", "Title": "\u201cHooters - Just OK...\u201d", "Author": "babylou21", "ReviewID": "UR7756325", "Content": "Hooters has hit the strip.

I'm not sure why they have the poker room but mostly play on 2 tables outside the poker room... You come in from the parking garage right next to these tables. Very distracting.... Always people trying to get through.. etc.... Room - Well.... I thought the room was ok... We had a view of the pool and airport. However the window was so dirty that if you wanted any pictures you had to slide it open and stick you arm out the window. We called 3 times to get the window clean but management never called back... They just DO NOT CARE... Parking - Well that is quick and easy but the elevators.. Honestly they sounded like they were literally coming apart. A must fix. Parking is abundant. A bit hard to get through the garage as they are tight corners.. Same way up is the same way down.. Watch out for the other guy..... I was expecting a cleaner place since it was recently redone. But that is far from True. A quick paint job, new beds and coverings and that is it... They even still used the same ole door hinges from the San Remo that have years worth of paint splatter on them.. Only good thing going is the hooter girls... Poker room is a joke..

Firstly lets get a couple of ground rules set. If you wish to stay in a mega resort with an abundance of shops, attractions and restaurants, then don't waste your time and money by coming here. However if you wish to stay in a good quality mid range hotel where you can get typical Hooters style food (ie wings, burgers and beer) whilst kicking back by a beach style pool area, then Hooters is definately for you. Located on the site of the old San Remo, next to the Tropicana just off the South end of the strip and across the road from the MGM Grand's hotel entrance, Hooters was hosting families, elderly couples and a large array of single women (as well as the ubiquitous single men) when we stayed there. It possesses the \"Dan Marino Steakhouse\" which targets those who want a higher end feed as well as a generous buffet and snacks at the bar. A convenience store/souvenir shop is located at one end of the casino floor and another souvenir shop is located at the other end of the casino floor as well. Check in was quick and efficient and friendly. The rooms are what you'd expect from a mid range hotel Vegas hotel. Neat, tidy two double beds and a more than adequate bathroom. Our room overlooked the pool area which was a good location. We had no problems with noise either in the hallways or from outside. A very well appointed gymnasium is located off the pool and was cheap by Vegas standards at only $10USD per day. Overall I was more than happy with my stay at Hooters. One word of warning though.

The lobby was very easy to navigate with a fast check in service Small but engaging gambling floor-lots of slots that pay and lots of tables that were always busy-including a hooters girl pit for those who just can't get enough!! Great restaurants Hooters was above average compared to our local Hooters and-Make sure you try the nachos at The Dam restaurant-HOLY COW-big enough for 3-4 people who are really hungry-and they're good too!!! We had to have them twice while we were there Super comfortable beds! Clean rooms and great views from the ocean view tower Hooters rewards club-Make sure you join it's free -swipe your card on a daily absis to try for a million, but if you don't win, you still get free points towards cash back as well as free hooters stuff like t-shirts, shot glasses, etc! We did our cheesy gifts form Vegas shopping this way! Negatives: Room was a little low budget for Vegas-but still nice-just not a lot of glam Smell of smoke occasionally in the morning in our room---not sure why??? Overpriced Hooters stuff-but it's all overpriced in Vegas! Pool could use some more landscaping, but it's still a super fun place, with an actual waterfall coming down. Very fun amotsphere, conviently located to food and drink access. Overall we had a great low budget vacation in Vagas, and Hooters was the highlight!

My husband was delighted to find we were staying at Hooters as any husband would. We rented a car and parked in the Parking Garage reluctlantly. There are some cameras in the garage try to park your car in a view of the camera that is what we did and never had a problem. There is no Valet here and the only other option is to park in the lot in between here and tropicana. Okay Beware of the Parking Garage Elevators one of them creaks and makes the most horrid noises it sounds as thought the box you are in is just going to pop. However we never got stuck and instead had a few laughs about it. Check in was a Breeze, the girl was friendly enough and I told her we were celebrating a special occasion and asked if there were any upgrades? She went and talked to her manager and offered me a Presidential Suite for $50 per night Upgrade or a International Suite for Free, We took the freebee. What a great room. We were in the Bayview tower which I think is the most accessable tower. Room 901 it was literrally right next door to the elevator which was a hoot, but seriously we never heard the elevator once or noise in the hallways which are very cute with surfboards and other cute decor. We entered the room to a huge entry way with a full bathroom, then a Bar with sink and fridge, palm trees Orange and Brown Decor, A huge plazma flat screen tv, little table to have cocktails at, a full size couch L shaped, the Bedroom was seperate and was very tropical themed I thought very cute. there was another TV, Desk, closet, and another Full Bathroom. We paid $50 a night what a deal. We went downstairs and sat at the 13 martini bar and enjoyed the live band that played yor requests, they rocked and we had a great time. We ate at the Damn Restrant a couple of times and the service was excellent and the food was too at a great price. Cute Diner.. Also ate at Pete and shortys, had some wings and slider burgers they were good too. The people at the club orange werevery friendly and helpful. Sportbook guy was nice too. Cocktail service is Non existant here I once ordered a drink and never saw her again. We hung out by the pool at night they had nice fires in pits that you could sit or stand around. Really enjoyed how easy the property was to get around. Yes it is small but we enjoyed that. Spent a lot money in the Bait Shoppe on goodies to bring home and was diappointed I didnt get a chance to try the hidden sushi bar in the back. We enjoyed our stay and safely walked from Hooters into the tropicana where we won some $ fast. also walked the four corners, went to Coyote Ugly was kinda fun, checked out the ceterfuge bar at MGM. All in all it was a great time. We are heading back to Hooters in March and I am hoping the second time will be as awesome as the first.

We ate 3 times at Pete & Shorties (the sports betting bar), which had a basic bar menu with appetizers, sandwiches and salads; we particularly liked the mini-burgers and side salad. We had dinner one evening at the Hooters restaurant (your basic Hooters) and one evening at the Back Portch which is on the back side of Hooters and has the same menu. We spent most of our evenings at the Lobby Bar. The atmosphere in the casino and the entire hotel is very casual, fun and laid back; we LOVED it. The casino is much smaller than the others we saw on the strip. The only negative was on the last evening at the Lobby Bar when we were told our drinks would not be comped unless we had a minimum of $10 in the machine and playing max bets (new rules all of a sudden?). We left and went to Pete & Shorties where we were told the same thing; again, we had been here 3 days and had not heard this. Other than these 2, all servers were very friendly and efficient.

We frequent the Vegas strip and stayed at the Mandalay, Imperial Palace, Rio, Bally's,Harrah's, Paris, Bellagio....to name a few,but since we were only there for 1 (one) night and this was the Superbowl weekend, the prices of any hotels on the strip were astrinomical. Out of all the cheaper hotels we could have stayed at, my reason for choosing Hooter's was that it's new and the location -(I knew their grand opening was just about a year ago and that it was very near the South Strip (next to Tropicana and accross from MGM)). Booked reservation through tripres.com for about ($126) and was quoted a \"Bungalow\" style room. We ended up on the 2nd floor on the Bay View tower next to the elevator. (I asked why I was given a regular tower room and front desk said I need to pay $30 to reserve your request). Check in(arrived at 2p.m.) was quick and easy and rooms were ready and clean and a little bigger than what was pictured on the website. Cosmetic wise, the room was comfortable,new, and inviting (furniture, sheets, bedding-comfy!!!,towels,etc.-all new and plush) The building structure needs repair- shower needs temp. control-streams of hot water would jet out while showering,walls are a bit thin, you could hear the neigbors opening closet doors and murmuring but we were surprised we didn't hear the elevators); and the elevators-very tempermental, so please know your fire escape. Staff wise, everyone was average, they don't go out of the way to please you but just there to do their job and to answer questions. They might need to staff more cocktail waitresses cause it was very rare to have a comp. drink while playing the slots. If you ladies are worried about the taboo, only the cocktail waitresses are dressed the same as the girls at your local hooter's not the dealer's, the front desk, the Dam restauant workers etc. - there's no girls gone wild here!!!! Other than the 4a.m. fire/emergency drill and a short direct t.v. cable outtage at 3a.m., all was great! I would go back to the Hooter's hotel if the only purpose was just to rest (your in a city where there is something to do 24/7!!!). It's better than the IP, Harrah's, the downtown Vegas hotels or any other OLDER hotels on the strip. But if you are looking for the Las Vegas experience, pay more and stay at the bigger hotels with more amenities. Other tips from other ta's: get the club orange card for store discounts (20% off), the Dam restaurant is like a old-school Diner and prices are reasonable - had the prime rib for $6.95 and the burger - big- w/ seasoned fries for $10-24/7. Casino has $10 blackjack and $5 war. Walk next to the Tropicana for $5 blackjack and go to the MGM for Sports Booking. Location is great-just bring comfortable shoes. Only when we stayed at Hooter's, we noticed a tram at the MGM, don't know where it goes but we'll find out the next time we stay there!

This hotel allowed Saturday night check-in, which is rare in Vegas, and the price ($170) was cheap in comparison to some of the bigger hotels on the strip. It was only a short cab ride to where we needed to be on the strip anyways. Check-in was smooth and easy and there were no mix-ups with my pre-paid reservation. The room was clean and nice. Nothing spectacular, but adequate in every way for a shower and a bed to sleep on. The casino is small but busy and patrons all seemed to be enjoying themselves. There is a small sports bar, an old-school diner, a regular Hooter's restaurant, and Dan marino's (finer dining) on site. We opted for the Hooter's restaurant for lunch and the service was quick and friendly. The waitresses all wear the standard t-shirt and orange shorts (both regular and cocktail waitresses on the casino floor). The only real negatives were one minor and one major complaint. The minor complaint is that the average patron was a little bit on the lower-class side. This is to be expected at one of the chaper hotels near the strip. If they were high-rollers that could afoord $800/night at Bellagio, they wouldn't be at Hooter's. This was of no consequence to us, but for those of you who feel uneasy around lower socio-economic people you might consider spending more money elsewhere. We were stared down by two imposing ex-con looking guys near the diner (for no apparent reason) but we just laughed it off. The major complaint is that my friend's truck that was parked overnight in the Hooter's parking garage was broken into and several items were taken (resulting in a $500 deductible). I would not recommend parking here. Other than that, it is a decent value for the $$. I can highly recommend Tao restaurant (at Venetian) for dinner and Pure nightclub (in Caesar's) for clubbing, if you have the $$.

I needed something within walking distance of the strip at a reasonable price because I needed three rooms. It was actually a friend who spotted this bargain on-line after she heard about our plans and decided to join us. Our price was $179.00/night and even at that price I don't think they were full by New Year's eve. Check-in was a breeze and despite one room not being immediately ready, it was 45 minutes later. They put our 21 yr old (and her boyfriend) next to us and my other daughter directly across the hall. Very convenient for our meeting during our three nights there. Rooms were comfortable, linens upgraded, bathrooms only average to less than average. There is no desk. Walls were thin but we never had any real problems with that. We dined in the Dam Restaurant a number of times; for lunch, breakfast and a late night snack. Service there was great, a rarity in Las Vegas. I ate in Hooters on two different occassions, in each instance service was excellent. This despite the second time it being five of us and being during the lunch hour on Sunday, in the middle of NFL football. Lines were 30 people long but we were in within ten minutes The staff was well trained consistent with all of their locations I was told. But I save my biggest compliments for \"13 Martini\", the lounge where my daughter had her first official drink. The waitress, Brittany, took note of the occassion, asked her what she wanted for her first drink and delivered that drink on the house at the witching hour of midnight. In a crowded bar with a rock n' roll band playing in the background she didn't have to pay that much attention. She did, the band acknowledged the event,...it was all good. In summary, we could have stayed next door at the Tropicana for twice the price, but didn't. We could have searched for good food with good service and more price at the MGM across the street, but wouldnt. We could have been considered just another cow following the herd but Hooters couldn't. They cut us from the pack on a couple of occasions and made us feel special. I will be back in Las Vegas in three weeks for a convention and I will be staying at Caesars. It will be nice and I will like it.

We arrived in a good mood, but left disappointed. We had reserved a non-smoking room with a king size bed. However, during check-in, we were informed that none of these rooms were available. After telling the young man at the registration desk that we had specifically reserved a non-smoking room with a king size bed several weeks ago, he told us that Hooters doesn't accept reservations, only requests for rooms, and none of the rooms that we requested were available. This wouldn't have been that big of a deal if we hadn't traveled across the country and my credit card hadn't already been billed for our 6-night stay. We asked for an upgrade, but were told that the only rooms available were smoking rooms with 2 full-size beds, but that we could be moved to the type of room we requested the next day. Since we didn't have any other options, we decided to accept his offer. I asked for a discount for the inconvenience, but was given four free drink coupons instead. Our first room was on the second floor. The view out of our open, unlocked, broken sliding glass door was of some electrical equipment. The bed comforters smelled strongly of smoke, the water took over a minute to get hot, and it tasted moldy. The next day, we had to wait until 2:00 PM for our \"expected\" room to become available. The water in this room still tasted moldy, but the water didn't take long to heat up since hot water was constantly leaking from the shower. This was more of a feature than a problem for us. This room also overlooked the pool area, which was a bonus, but it didn't change our impression of the hotel. Perhaps if we got this room from the start, we'd be happier with the hotel. The maids were the nicest people in the hotel. The staff at the registration desk were mixed. Some were very nice, some weren't. The Hooters restaurant was good, but no different than any other Hooters restaurant across the country. The casino is small compared to other nearby casinos, but this wasn't a big deal to us, since we don't gamble much. This hotel is a 5-minute walk from the intersection of Tropicana Blvd. and Las Vegas Blvd. If you've never been to Las Vegas before or stayed on The Strip, this probably won't be an issue. However, having stayed at New York New York last year, my wife and I agreed that it would be worth the few extra bucks a night to stay on The Strip in a newer hotel than save money by staying off the strip in this refurbished hotel.", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "TN", "Title": "\u201cHurray for Hooters!!\u201d", "Author": "jmert", "ReviewID": "UR6160849", "Content": "Just got back from a 3 day trip to Vegas-stayed at Hooters on Saturday and Sunday nights (rates of $69 and $49)!

We called to talk in person to verify there was no mistake. We were instucted that the rate was a promotional rate because it was a new hotel. We were given a choice of tower rooms or poolside bungalows. We chose a bungalow. BAD DECISION! First, there is nothing \"new\" about this hotel. It is a slightly refurbished group of old buildings. The bungalow room we were given was dirty, and rundown to say the least. As it was late in the evening we decided to \"deal with it \" for the night. We attempted to clean our room, only to notice there were ants crawling all over the bathroom counter. Not to worry a few ants can't be that big of a deal, I will just take a quick shower and take care of things in the morning, Hah ! Not a chance, unless a cold shower was good enough, after all it was a cheap rate. The hot water was almost non existent in the tub. I don't mean that the water would only flow cold, I mean water wouldn't flow at more than a trickle from the hot water faucet.( this \"new\" hotel has old two handle faucets, probably got a good deal on them on E-bay) The water flow wasn't enough to make the shower head spray. At least the bed had a comfortable mattress. Upon going to the front desk in the morning and bringing my concerns to their attention, I was informed \" What do you expect you booked the cheapest room in the place\" After being insulted in a such a manner, I answered back \" I don't consider a clean, bug free room with running hot water to be too much to ask for. After a few more snotty comments from both sides I was informed, I would be moved to a tower room for the remainder of my stay, however they wouldn't be able to move me until the afternoon.

I'm a 26 year male who went with three other friends to Las Vegas for spring break last spring. My friends insisted on this hotel because it was Hooters. I resisted after reading reviews on this site, and knowing that you don't go to \"Hooters\" expecting to meet women. Apparently my friends don't realize this (probably why they remain single). Well, we arrived early and the desk clerk was nice enough to give us our room key and let us check and see if the room was ready or not. We go up and the room is filthy which, I expected because it hadn't been cleaned yet and, its Las Vegas. We booked a \"suite\". Tthis nothing more than an apartment room and an adjoining single room with a bathroom, its a joke. We go back down let the front desk know the room isn't ready and go back up 2 hours later. The room is \"cleaned\", but still smells of stale cigarette smoke and vomit. Not only this but we drop our bags and begin to walk around and the floor is soaking wet in the whole living room. We call mantinence and they do nothing so we complain and receive a new room not a \"suite\", along with the discounted price. This room is dirtier than the first one but at least the carpet's not wet. We also found roaches, the kind you step on, AND the kind you smoke, and on that note you have to deal with people offering you drugs on the elevator. I really can't put into words how cheap and nasty this place is. I mean four guys in their twenties hated this place, thats how bad it is. Its important when in Vegas to decide where you will spend most of your time. If on the strip, spend the money and stay at a decent place like Mandalay Bay, New York, Bellagio. My favorite was the Venetian. If you are looking for a good time and cheap thrills, and some cool bars, stay downtown in Old Vegas. Hotels are more important in Vegas than anywhere else, because everything is centered around them on the strip.

The hotal is a little crowded being smaller then other hotals in the area. Its at the end of the strip near the motal 6. Everything is wood and orange like a Hooters restaurant.

Called down to the desk and was hung up on by accident and then tried agian and spoke with Robert who said try again in a few minutes and he hung up. Waited a few minutes and it worked and we enjoyed the live hockey from Montreal. Had some ice cold brews we bought at a gas station which was much cheaper then anything in the hotals. Ate and drank once at the on site hooters restaurant which I think is one of the worst restaurants out there in food quality which I still feel the same. Ate mosly at the 24hr dinar called the Dam which had $6.95 prime rib which was the best deal in Vegas we found. Ate at Dan marinos and was the best meal we had all week but also costed the most at a cool $50 before tip for a steak. They do have other lower cost foods so don't get scared away. Most people said there wern't that much hooter girls around but I saw plenty from working in the resaurant or dealing at a table in the casino there was no shortage of the eye candy.

The Dam Restaurant was great - anything on the menu 24/7 - nothing like a good burger and fries for breakfast or prime rib at 5am before going to bed. I went there one afternoon with a friend to get some nachos and asked the waiter if I could get a beer and I guess they don't actually serve it in that restaurant, but he went the bar and got me one - what a nice guy.

I really like going to Hooters so I was excited about staying here, but what a let down. They have essentially taken what was obviously an old run down hotel casino, slapped some orange paint and pine paneling on it and reopened it. Ceilings are low, rooms are small, d\u00e9cor is predictably tacky. There are no pleasant surprises that are the hallmark of a quality experience. The pool deck is pathetic, imagine a pool from a 70\u2019s era Holiday Inn then put some orange paint and place some Tiki shacks around it; No wonder the recent Hooters swimsuit competition was NOT held here. The staff is new and it shows, they definitely need a lot of training, they are simply not up to Vegas standards. Hooters girls - don't plan on seeing many of them, Although they are in the Hooters Bar inside the hotel, you\u2019ll only see one or two anywhere on the gaming floor or on the pool deck. We reserved a non-smoking King room and upon arrival were told a two double bed room is all that is available (which we later learned was a lie). The front desk girl (like most staff here not a Hooter\u2019s girl, but a conservatively dressed typical employee) explained that a reservation isn\u2019t really a reservation it\u2019s a \u201crequest\u201d. At that point had I not prepaid the entire trip through an online travel service I would have quickly jumped ship and found someplace else to stay, but that wasn\u2019t an option. Once in the room we found we couldn\u2019t make local phone calls or use dial-up internet service from our room. Also the room had obviously been a smoking room previously. When we complained to the front desk and got no response we took it up with management the next morning who graciously upgraded us to a suite free of charge. Due to some sort of supposed computer screw up the phone wouldn\u2019t work in the suite either. This took numerous calls and finally was fixed on day 3 of our stay. In spite of other disappointing aspects of the hotel, the dining is excellent. The \u201cDam Restaurant\u201d diner has both great meals and service. They offer a very innovative menu and big servings making for a great value. For classier eating \u201cDan Marino\u2019s\u201d restaurant offers a great menu, d\u00e9cor and service and yet is surprisingly reasonably priced. Although I won\u2019t be staying at Hooters next time I\u2018m in Vegas I will definitely go back to these restaurants. Overall probably this would probably be a great place in Panama City Beach, FL in the eighties, but it certainly isn\u2019t up to standards you expect of today\u2019s Las Vegas.

Housekeeping was alright but seemed to bug us alot when we were sleeping as we didn't have a do not disturb sign. The casino was smaller than casinos on the strip but it was still fun. The pool was very nice and relaxing. Lots of chairs and many different pool choices, larger deeper pool, very cold shallower pool, large whirlpool and the hot tub which was awesome. The location of the hotel was decent. To catch the monorail we would walk across the street to MGM, about a 10 min walk. Wasn't too bad except the 110 degree heat. =) You can also walk to Tropicana and even to NY NY or Excalibur in about 10 min too.

For the dates we were looking, about the only cheaper rooms were way over in Primm. Being that Hooters took over the San Remo and started some remodeling, this place was in pretty good shape. There was still the faint smell of fresh wood from the paneling. The A/C in our room was older, and therefore a little louder than usual, but not so much that it interrupted my sleep. (Besides, you're in Vegas, you should only be in your room when you're about to pass out from exhaustion). It was a very basic room: Bed, table w/ 3 stools, tv/ent center w/ a few drawers, closet w/ safe (which was locked - you have to have security unlock it, apparently), fake potted plants, and a small desk w/ chair. Instead of end tables, they have a shelves. The King sized bed was actually comfortable. Bathroom had a shower/tub, hair dryer, and individual cup coffee maker. The Casino was on the small side, but lively and colorful. The dealers were friendly, and there were alot of places to grab a drink or a bite to eat. The official Hooters restaurant closes around 11'ish, but the all-nite cafe next door has some of the Hooters menu items. Our server, Audrey, was very fun and friendly. The pool had a posted sign about people being under 21 not allowed. All-in-all, it was a great value for the money. I hate spending copious amounts of money on rooms in Vegas, considering the small amount of time I spend in them. If you're looking to spend alot of time in your room and expect luxurious accomodations - Hooters is not for you. Try the Bellagio or Venetian.

He said he could check me in right away if I didn't mind staying in the handicap room, or I could wait a few hours and get a standard room. I told him I didn't mind and so he checked me in. We chatted and joked a bit as he prepared my paperwork. After unpacking, I went downstairs to the same clerk and asked if I could get a late check-out on Sunday. He asked how late and I said 3pm. He looked at his computer and gave me a 5pm check-out! Wow! I was very surprised. We headed to the 24 hr.cafe/diner (forgot the name) and had a great eggs/bacon/pancake breakfast which ran about $8/person....cheap!! Next we headed to the pool. The pool was a bit crowded, but in a fun way. There were beautiful women everywhere, including the Hooters calendar girls which were walking around trying to sell autographed copies of their calendars. Still, there were a lot more men than women. The casino was a bit small, but big enough to be fun. I had fun playing craps, and this dealer girl with funky glasses kept giving me betting tips. Hooters is right behind the Tropicana, which means that the strip is within walking distance. We walked to the MGM Grand, the NYNY, and the Tropicana. One problem that I did have, which I've had at other hotels, is that in the late morning/early afternoon, everyone wants to use the elevators at the same time. So, it took me 30-40 minutes to get from my room to the casino because all of the elevators were full. One other problem that I had was that the parking spaces in the structure are terribly small. It seemed as if all of them were of compact-size. Also, there was trash on the ground all throughout the parking structure. Check-out was a breeze. We stopped at the bar (which is directly in front of the reservations desk) before leaving to have one last shot, and the hooters girl that helped us gave us the shots for free even though we weren't gambling.

Finally when I checked out they tried to charge me for the room that was in the tower, not at the bungalow rates, a mistake that they themselves screwed up.

As such, I wasn't expecting anything more than a change clothes and crash for the night. Overall, they've just put a fresh coat of paint and nailed on some unfinished wood wherever they can fit it, which resulted in a hotel that kind of had a lumberyard smell to it. The rooms were functional, but not at all glamorous. The Hooters branding in the rooms seems to have been to throw in a couple barstools and add some orange lampshades. Our toilet never seemed to flush right, and the showerhead appeared to have been the original one from the San Remo days: all clogged up and spouting at angles. As others have mentioned, room noise was apparent to us, and even in a state of exhaustion and drunkeness at 4am, we were kept up by a couple arguing, crying, and tossing things around upstairs. The gaming downstairs is ok, but after the novelty of hooters girls wears off, isn't anything special. Plus, it's a mostly-male sawdust joint vibe downstairs, which shouldn't be much of a suprise if you're familiar with Hooters. Food options were limited at 3am, and it seemed the staff in the cafes were always shorthanded or disorganized because long waits were the norm. The signature chicken wings also didn't seem to be what they usually are in the restauraunt, which was disappointing. Wouldn't recommend for couples or anyone looking for a remotely personal or classy vegas hotel experience.", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, NE", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly Suprised\u201d", "Author": "mlm373", "ReviewID": "UR4586946", "Content": "Got in around 11pm on Friday 3/3, walked right up to the counter and checked in - no wait at all. We had 3 people offer to check us in. Within 2 minutes we had our room key for room 1135 with views of Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and NYNY - not too shabby. Room wasn't as orange and bright as the online pictures made it out to be. The bed was unusually high for a hotel and it was soft and comfy. Cute 'beachy' theme throughout. Plenty of room to get ready - 3 full length mirrors and a separate vanity outside of the bathroom. Everything was clean. Shower was high (good for tall husband) and had just the right amount of power. Negatives in the room were ancient alarm clock, bathroom sink wouldn't hold water and the air conditioner was unusually noisy. Casino is crowded and extremely loud. Hooter girls seemed to be more covered up than they are in our local restaurant here in NE which I thought was odd. Band in the bar was decent and fun. Good location right across the street from the monorail. I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a reasonable hotel and doesn't mind walking a bit.", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "fort worth", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed\u201d", "Author": "texan_8", "ReviewID": "UR4584733", "Content": "I was in Las Vegas for a business trip and we decided to go see the new Hotel. Supposedly they spent 55 mil. renovating the old San Remo but am not sure where that all went. The casino seemed to be very small and you would think that all dealers would be girls, but I would say 40% of the dealers were guys including mine! We waited approx. 1 hour to get into the restaurant which I thought was a little long to eat wings. The dealers were extremely slow and did seem to make lots of mistakes. We did not get a chance to look in the rooms, but the casino and restaurant were a big disappointment and would not recommend.", "Date": "March 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Tx", "Title": "\u201cNot ready for business\u201d", "Author": "tex2step", "ReviewID": "UR4579537", "Content": "This place has potential, but it's got a long way to go. First off, for you casino players- the player card readers in the slot machines rarely work. The club orange workers are slow and not attentive. It took us about 25 minutes to get a one hundred dollar pay out on a slot machine. We had casino workers tell us they would be right with us but never did. If I had won the money, that would have been fine. But, this is what I had put into the machine. Although there were drink waitresses, I rarely saw them. As for the hotel--- the set up is pretty freaky. One bank of elevators broke down three times in the short time I was there. It is very difficult to get in to the check in area from the parking garage. You have to go through a ton of people in a tighter than usual set up. Literally, from the check in counter, you are less than two feet away from about 10 slot machines. We had a very nice two bedroom suite; but one of the sinks did not work. The refrigerator was in the middle of the room still wrapped in plastic. Some of the electrical ports did not work. This was the same with some of the light switches. The noise from the parking garge carries to all the rooms on the side of the garage. So there were car alarms going off all night and drunken guys screaming at 4am that they could not find their keys (a bad situation no matter how you look at it). We met a few other guests who had bad experiences. I will chalk this one up to the hotel being new and NOT yet having it's groove. But with the way the staff was, it seemed like they had been there for years and many of them seemed disgruntled. Don't bother with room service during peak hours-- the food will be cold by the time you get it. Still, I would consider giving this place another shot- but I will wait at least a year before I do. If you do stay here and you are near the parking garage- make them switch you. There's nothing worst than waking up to car alarms all night long with a hangover coming on.", "Date": "March 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Surprise\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4578776", "Content": "I recently attended a professional meeting in Vegas and frankly could not get a reasonably priced room elsewhere.

Very comfortable, clean and extremely friendly staff. The room service was slow but the food good, prices fair. A great retreat from the crazy husle and busle of the big and loud casino hotels. Short walk from entrance to room. I would return here. Incidently, the Hooter Girls seemed innocent compared to the garb other casinos put on their woman employees.
