All of the staff was young but very professional, there was a real nightlife occurring in the hotel every night of the week, but security was great and I was never worried about being bothered by the bar clientele when I needed a good night's rest. In fact, I couldn't hear any noise from the clubs whatsoever when we were there. The room was very comfortable and the shower was great. I wouldn't think this is a place that would be enjoyed by people with young kids or by older adults. Definitely unique. It would be fun to go there on a weekend get-away with a loved one.

There must be a sewer or water issue. That sewer stench and vomit smell were there through my entire stay. The carpets in the hallway and in my room needed a good deep clean. Hotel is starting to show some wear and tear and smell. I work at a casino and there are cleaners for the vomit smell and how hard is it to deep clean the carpets???

The Guest Services manager at the Hard Rock worked with me from the beginning, providing top-notch excellent service the likes of which you cannot find outside of Vegas. We arrived and were treated as royalty, given complimentary drinks, set up in a fantastic modern and trendy suite with fantastic views of the Gaslamp district. The concierge team had set up special items in our room for our anniversary, and had my girlfriend's favorite music playing as we walked in! All of the staff we encountered, whether we had questions, small problems, or were just walking by, were incredibly energetic, nice, professional and fun. We did everything: Took advantage of the concierge, Massages at Rock Spa, dining at the in-hotel restaurants, drinks at FLOAT, room service. When we found the hotel hot tub was closed for some renovations, the staff took care of us and got us into the Omni hotel's hot tub next door. Pros: Service: If you like being treated fantastically, feeling special, and having a qualified staff truly making your day, stay here! Location: This hotel is literally steps away from the convention center, Petco ballpark, and is a major destination itself within San Diego's Gaslamp district. Unbelievable bars, restaurants, shopping and site-seeing around every corner. Value: This hotel is only a few dollars more than neighboring hotels, but offers many times the service, excitement and buzz than they do. Best value in town! The Rock Star Life: If you like the scene, clubbing, hanging out with friends and listening to great music...this is the place for you. On Saturday nights, the Hard Rock becomes a buzzing hive of activity. It felt like Vegas in the main lobby. Cons: Um, sure...let me think of something. The breakfast food at Mary Jane's was less than stellar. It's a good thing so many other eating choices are within a few blocks. There is no refrigerator in the guest room. Details: We each enjoyed a massage at the Rock Spa, which had very nice staff and luxurious spa rooms with robes, sandals, and complimentary tea, flavored water and amenities for all guests. The Hard Rock staff not only clean your room once a day, they also do a turn-down service at night. We enjoyed the complimentary waters, and flavored rock candy stir-sticks. The suites are amazing! There are rain-fall dual head showers big enough for two (or three!) and very comfortable beds and seating. There is no outside alcohol allowed in the hotel, so plan accordingly. If you've got the money, in-room or poolside bottle service is available most of the day. This hotel is for the party-rocking crowd. If you like a quiet lobby and sedate surroundings, stay elsewhere (and maybe avoid the Gaslamp altogether). If you're like me and love to people watch and let loose and mingle, this is your kind of place. I've enjoyed the Gaslamp many times, and have stayed at Solamar, the Sofia, the Hilton, and now the Hard Rock, and when I come back, I'll be staying at the Hard Rock Hotel every time.

I realize it's the Hard Rock Hotel but come on, if you are booking in a family, don't put them next to the party tent, put the 20 year old there! I spoke with the Manager before he left and he was apologetic but couldn't comp us a night because be book through Expedia... ridiculous!

The Hard Rock is directly across the street from the convention center, a five minute walk with time to wait for the traffic lights to change. Driving from the airport to the hotel was an interesting challenge, if you are coming down harbor drive (in front of the convention center) you will have to circle the block because 5th Ave is one-way so you can pull in front of the hotel for valet parking. I will note, valet parking was ridiculously expensive! About $40 a day, plus tips, by far the most expensive valet parking I have ever had to pay anywhere. There is public parking which is $24 a day around the corner. The lobby was very modern, they were playing music when we first walked in, and behind the desk they have a wall sized LCD screen playing music videos. We got in on Saturday afternoon, the front desk quickly checked us in, and got us up to our room on the 11th floor to our room facing Petco Park. I will warn all of you, your key card is required to go anywhere in the elevator, so be sure to have it with you all the time. The hotel was very quiet, with the exception of Saturday night. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. The maids do not automatically come and clean the room. There is a door hanger that is two sided indicating if you are requesting a room cleaning, but the front desk explains all of this in detail upon arrival. The rooms are very clean and well set up. The mini bar and snack bar is filled with all sorts of interesting things; they had everything from red bull, vodka, reeses, to the first aid kits or a toothbrush. The bars downstairs were both very nice, but what really impressed me was the restaurant Mary Jane's downstairs. By far the best restaurant in the hotel! We only had a noise issue on Saturday night, due to all of the partying downstairs, I briefly visited downstairs and they had the elevator area roped off and were ID-ing guests coming in from the outside. The hotel is within walking of a ton of fabulous restaurants and Westerfield Plaza. The trolley stops right in front of the hotel.

I was given a complimentary upgrade which was so awesome and the staff there were so friendly. When I was given my key, the guy was right behind us with our bags. He was so amazing and cute too :). He asked why we came out here, told me happy birthday, gave us good ideas on places to go and to eat. After putting our bags in our room he went and got ice for us with out even asking. The room was great size. I had 10 of my friends who came out and the room was big enough to accomadate all of us. I love how you walked in and there was a den which included a lounge sofa and table and mini bar. In the front room was a cord that connected to the tv where would could play our music from our phone on the tv. I thought that was nice High Tech option. The bathroom and shower were on seperate sides of the room which i did like, however i did not like the shower because there was an extra step you had to take to get in it which didnt make since because it was all wet and some one could fall and hurt them self if they did not see it. The shower was nice on the other end because the water came from both the top and from an angle. Our room faced the side where baseball standium was and had an ipod ready hook up in there as well. the room had a curtain that seperated the room from the den which i thought was lovely because i could keep my personals left out with out any one going into the room and being worried about anything. Overall, this hotel rocked. I did not get a chance to get to the bars but i know they are twice as amazing. In the morning mary janes was really crowded so i would def. have to try that place when i come back to this side of town. the check out process was very fast and easy.

We were unaware that it is normal in the USA to have a 4pm check in (most UK hotels are 2pm). Unfortunately this was not communicated to us very well by check in staff. If the receptionist had advised us that our room would not be ready until 4pm we would have probably done some sight seeing. Instead we were told that the room should be ready soon so we decided to wait around in the bar. The room wasn't ready until 4pm, meaning that we had been waiting for two hours. Whilst I wouldn't expect that a room would be ready before check in, it would have preferable that we were told that it would be ready for 4pm rather than leading us to believe it may be ready sooner. This wasn't helped by how irritable we were from travelling. (We had been awake since 2am). After we were let in to our room and we had unpacked it was late on in the day and we were only staying for 2 nights and so we were looking forward to using the pool the next day (our only full day in the resort). The room was clean and nicely decorated. The next day, we went out in the morning and came back just after lunch to use the pool. Unfortunately we were advised on arrival that it had been hired out to a private party along with the poolside bar for the remainder of the day. This was extremely disappointing as I think hotel guests should really have priority use of the facilities. We decided to go back out for the remainder of the afternoon and came back early evening and decided to go for drink in the downstairs bar. I was extremely annoyed to find out that this had also been hired out for the evening. When checking out we were told that we had to pay a resort fee (this was a new term to me) and when I asked what it covered, the receptionist told me it covered the use of facilities. Given the limited access that we had to these, I think that the resort fee should not have been charged. I didn't have the energy to argue.

I was also annoyed that guests have to pay a cover charge just to get in the overcrowded hotel bars on the weekend. Our company spent well into 6 figures for a meeting here, but there are no benefits given for doing that, like access to the hotel bar. The place caters to the public and not to guests on weekends. I wasn't there on a Friday to see what that's like, but forget trying to sleep on a Saturday night. There were people going in and out of rooms and screaming in the hallways all night long, finally quieting down at 6 am. I thought this was going to be a long week at the place. Rating the hotel 2 stars at this point. What a difference a day makes. By Sunday afternoon, spring break at Ft. Lauderdale was over and the loud drunk 20-somethings were gone and the place was more normal. The Club 207 bar on the ground floor was a disappointment repeatedly. On a couple of nights almost immediately after pouring our group many drinks, bouncers drove everyone out of the place in a not very cool way at what seemed to be random times, once just after 12:30. I guess take the money and treat people poorly is the business strategy here. Rooms at the place are nice and the housekeeping quality is good. Good shower with rain head. The meeting facilities were one of the highlights of the property.

I was overall very pleased with the experience. Here are some details: Check-in: I got the VIP check-in since I booked the trip on Expedia.com where I am an elite member. Basically, this consists of being taken to the \"Green Room\" where they will give you a drink of your choice during check-in, as well as a free room upgrade. This last part didn't happen because they were full. They told me to check on Friday to see if another room is available, but I never did. I requested a quiet room and got room 705, with pool-view. I didn't realize the first night that my window was open a few inches, letting in the train whistle sound at 3 am. After I closed this, the room was quiet enough. They ask what type of music you prefer at check-in. I requested a free in-room guitar for my stay. You get to pick 3 guitars from a menu and they bring you one of them. For me, none of my 3 choices were available, so they sent me a Fender Telecaster. Being a guitarist, this was a cool perk. I did have to wait about 15 minutes for my room to be ready, although I checked in right at 3pm. Room: They have your favorite style of music playing in the room on your arrival, which is very cool. The room is laid out with rock art work/imagery, lots of alcohol in and out of the fridge, guitar pick sticker on toilet paper roll, etc. I enjoyed all this minus the alcohol, because of the crazy mark-up on alcohol. There is no microwave in the room. We had 2 queen beds, flat screen tv with supposedly HD, but the picture was not in HD. I didn't order any in-room movies. The dual head shower was good and bad--good if you like/need both heads, bad because if you happen to turn one shower head off and turn it back on, it will disperse cold water first. I just left it on one shower head after a brief trial of both. Hard Rock bath scrubber was a nice touch. Gym: I used the gym 3 times during my 6 day stay. It had good upper/lower body machines, treadmills, free weights, etc. There's a flat-screen tv playing rock music videos. I especially liked \"Closer to the Heart\" by Rush that was played during one of my workouts. There are free towels and water available. The gym is located right next to the Rock Spa, where you could get facials/massages if you wanted to pay for them ($85-several hundred). Room service: not used 207 Club: VIP access before 10 pm, busy on Fridays/Saturdays. Pretty hip place, loud music as expected in a dance club. Overpriced drinks as expected. Mary Jane's, Nobu: not used Valet service: $37 per day, typical for Gaslamp Quarter hotels. I used it for the 3 days of my conference since my work reimburses, then used the much cheaper garage (with 24 hour access) behind the hotel.

Check in was quick and easy and the staff accommodated my request to be placed in the quiet part of the hotel. We tried to use the hot tub at 8pm and was told that it was closed...at 8 pm??? We thought that was a little unusual. We did use the fitness center which was equipped with treadmills and elliptical machines. There was a decent amount of weight lifting machines and equipment. The hotel itself is located at the base of the Gaslamp district. We were able to shop and had a very nice dinner without having to drive anywhere. Parking at the hotel is quite expensive...$37! There is a parking garage right across the street where we were able to park for $19. The hotel has a business center which I used to print out my boarding ticket the next day. Evidently it is part of the \"resort fee\" that I had to pay. The fee also included use of their computers in the center as well as wireless in the room. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, however at 3:30 in the morning the smoke detector started beeping and continued beeping every 30 seconds until 8:30 AM!

I was there for a conference at the Convention Center. The Hard Rock is located directly across the street from it. It could not have been more convenient. The hotel is in excellent shape. The maintenance crew does an excellent job of keeping up with things. Check in was a breeze. *****However, make sure you understand their resort fee policy (apprx. $17 per day). Apparently this fee is added to your room charges depending upon which method/portal that is used to make your reservation. My understanding is that the fee covers your internet and local calls. If you need to use a computer, the Business Center in the hotel has 4 available for use for no additional fee. There is also a printer available. Rooms: I stayed in single queen bed layout. It was a decent sized room with a huge bathroom. The bed was comfortable but nothing extraordinary. The pillows were okay too. The shower has a rain head spray fixture and a wall spray fixture. You can control the flow to them as you prefer. The water pressure was great and the water hot. I LOVED THE SHOWER!!! I did not want to get out. Room Location: There are some complaints about noise posted by some reviewers. ****Things to know: The quieter rooms are located along the outside perimeter of the hotel along 6th and K streets. The rooms that are even numbered are located along those streets. THE EXCEPTION - rooms that are even numbered starting with 00 -22 (I think} are located along the street for the front lobby and nightclub. Those are definitely louder ( friends stayed in those rooms and related this to me} The odd number rooms face the pool area and 5th street. They tend to be louder. Staff: I can say without exception that every staff member I encountered was friendly and professional. All seemed to be young and interested in making sure my stay was an enjoyable one. Food: I ate several meals Mary Jane's. Most were for breakfast, with one Happy Hour visit. The service was quick and the food was not your typical food service dreck. Quality ingredients, fresh squeezed orange juice and Star Bucks coffee. MY ONE complaint: they did not have Light Cream for the coffee, which I prefer. I settled for the half and half. Overall: I feel the hotel is geared to a younger progressive clientele. That being said, there people of all ages staying there. Please don't go there thinking it will be a Ritz/Hilton vibe. There is no Muzak on the elevators. There is a steady stream of rock music played through out the hotel. The Hard Rock reminded me of a W Hotel only better.

Both my friend and I got massages and the masseuses they had on staff gave us the best massages we had ever had (I wish I booked the 80 min!). The staff was really top notch there and I highly recommend booking a treatment there. The room was clean and slick and the showers are great (rain and a regular shower in one). They offered lots of great TV options so I was able to watch all the games on and a few movie channels too. They also offered a very useful app for the hotel called Tour Manager and that it was.

His company had their Christmas ball here last year (2010) and we were excited to have a weekend to ourselves. There were discounted rooms available, but we opted for a more special experience as we did last year and booked one of the Rock star suites. We incidentally had the exact same room last year so we knew what to expect. The room was $300 more per night than the company discounted rooms. We of course expect there to be some noise as we were above the club and things did quiet down around the expected closing time. Although I am trying convey some positive aspects, I feel compelled to tell the public what terrible customer service we received when we complained about a basic necessity. We stayed for two nights. The first night, our speakers and Tv remotes weren't working so we had a technician attempt to fix things, which he did, but never came back with the remote. When they did bring one back, it was the wrong one. We had lukewarm water that only became lukewarm after running for over twenty minutes, including the bathtub. But the worst part was that for the remainder of our stay we had no hot water (freezing cold only) despite having service technicians in the room while we were trying to get ready, and then being told it was fixed when it clearly was not. We were offered a new room at 11:30 pm Saturday night and were checking out the next am. When we very politely complained about the hot water, we were offered a comp at breakfast before checkout. In addition, there was a large party on the balcony room below us....loud, but expected. However, we had to call security to have them stop a fight with someone attempting to jump from the balcony. The bottom line is that we were more than willing to give you our money for a more \"rock star\" experience, but were given a small deduction from our total bill, that a true rock star would have never tolerated. If the company party is here next year, unfortunately I will tell everyone I know to stay at neighboring hotels.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cPacker stew in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "Magnum55", "ReviewID": "UR121861534", "Content": "I stayed at the Hard Rock with my wife on a short getaway the first weekend in Nov which happened to coincide with the Green Bay Packers visiting the San Diego Chargers that Sunday.

Lost of room to spread your stuff out, two flat screens, IPod docks just as advertised. One of our suitcases didn't make our connection to SD and the hotel was very helpful with the entire process. Toothbrushes and tooth paste was sent up and the front desk kept us posted on the status our suitcase's arrival. The walls are decorated with rock n' roll memorabilia and lyrics so if you're a fan there will be lots to look at. The pool area is quite nice but unfortunately it wasn't swimming weather so I didn't get a chance to use it. Some people have commented that the hotel is a little loud. I would have to agree that the hotel is quite boisterous so if you're looking for a quiet hotel then look elsewhere. If you're looking for a party then you've found your place! There is a bar on the main level and a nightclub on the pool level so there are a lot of people constantly circulating around the lobby area. In the evening the hotel tightens up security and guests have to show their room cards to get to the elevator banks leading to the guest rooms. Despite all of the action going on around us our room was very quiet and we slept very well. Hotel guests get free passes to the nightclub. My wife and I went one night and had a great time. There were quite a few military events going on in the hotel at the time and combined with the NFL fans the city and the hotel were quite busy. Despite the cool weather we had a great time at this hotel and would definitely recommend it. Overall the rooms and premises were very clean, the staff was helpful and...

There was a glitch in the system and apparently Im not one of those who receieved the 1st ten. However the manager Luke was kind enough to give me a great deal and upgrade my room to a Hard Rock Suite. And another manager/director Michelle went above and beyond in helping me with all of my needs. I had to say I was very upset at first because I already planned a huge reservation and was dissapointed with the sudden change of rate but they did everything in their power to compensate. I was planning a small get together for me and my friends and the small private lounge area at the room was perfect. They even tried to find me another room with a balcony however they were fully booked for the weekend During check in Courtney was very helpful in my booking, she tried to book me with a room w/ a balcony but later moved me at my request to another floor since the balcony had no view ( all wall) and gave me one with a spectacular view. Jeff and Ronnie helped with my VIP list for 207 and Float for the 2 nights which impressed my friends. I really felt like a rockstar complete with my entourage. The Rock Spa was amazing!!! Dolusa got all the kinks that has been bothering me for weeks and will highly recommend her. I love my room even the mini bar and the private bar that I have though I could not use them due to it being overpriced for me The Cons: As expected being a Hard Rock hotel in the middle of Gaslamp the #1 issue I had was the noise from other hard partying groups and the drunken patrons at the lobby area. being a girl who sometimes need to come down at Mary Janes or Nobu to grab a bite. Its difficult not to get bothered by a few drunk males or so, even at the elevator. My room was booked right next to a suite that had security called throughout their stay due to noise issues There was a snaffu with my inhouse credit as 2 other front desk agents needed to make sure/verify I had one as they nearly charged me an extra $50 at my final bill. After some show of proof from my confirmation emails that was all settled but did caused me to worry a bit There were some channels that were all \"paid programming\" and the Travel channel was just looping forever with Direct TV instructions. Not all windows are tinted so people from the other street can actually see you. And you seing them as one guy from an ajacent condo lasered us. The showers were amazing at the room but I think a shower curtain would be great as the angle of the shower head hits the dry area and tend to flood it with water Club 207 was great but i think they need to expand that club more as it was overly crowded in such small area space The Pros: Right snak in the heart of Gaslamp, we werent far from other eateries like pizza and ice cream which I can easily walk to, and the trolley could take us striaght to Old Town and Little Italy The curtain dividers was genius as it gave thisw sense of privace from the lounge area (Hard Rock Suite) I had one of the guitars sent out to my room and that was a riot to my friends to have one of the Fenders to be brought up for no cost at all. Massage at the Spa was AWSOME and wished the open the steam room earlier than 9:00am as I would love to use it after a 7 am workout The minibar and view were definate bragging rights to my friends and you have no idea all the compliments I got. And envy looks. The staff especially the security was awesome. Even some of the bouncers were nice I was treated like a rockstar by the people there. Though it would be nice a complimentary breakfast would be included in some of the packages Overall I would Give the Hard Rock a 3.5-4 out of 5 stars.

We arrived on Friday at around 3pm, and the whole hotel was basically a nightclub! It looked really swanky, the room was modern and cool, but the blaring music from the all day pool party ($$ to get in to the pool) and drunk wild young things stomping around the hotel took away from the experience for me...would have been awesome though if you were into dance music and wanted to PARTY! Seriously, everyone was having a brilliant time! We were kept up till 5am with a party next door and people shouting from their balconies. We certainly felt like old foggies! Saturday night was a bit better, but still the same type of clientele, young drunk hipsters. We tried to go to the pool but it was more of a pool that you don't swim in and wear expensive jewelry to sit around looking good, so we didn't venture out in our Speedo's. Sunday-Tuesday was like a different hotel!! The staff were courteous from day one, and I got to rent a Gibson guitar for free and we enjoyed eating at the diner in the hotel. We got great sleeps as the place was deserted of party goers, and it became just a better place to hang out! I did really like the hotel, it looked cool and the staff were really nice! I would probably prefer somewhere with a better pool scene and less chaotic weekends, but overall, IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE!", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overton, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cAwesome, but pricey.\u201d", "Author": "RacheAnne", "ReviewID": "UR120598149", "Content": "Big bucks but it does make you feel like a rock star.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fallbrook, California", "Title": "\u201cA VERY PLEASANT STAY.\u201d", "Author": "Lita D", "ReviewID": "UR120594996", "Content": "If you are looking for a first class hotel, this one will meet your expectations.

On my last visit I experienced the front desk, and they were amazing. But there is something about going into a private room and getting that little extra treatment. We had a private event on the roof, there Elevation patio. And the staff there was on the ball. I heard one guest ask for RedBull. Well, we didn't arranged ahead of time to have RedBull at the event. But within 5 minutes she was back with a cold RedBull in hand. The Float bar in the evening was great. This is Southern California, but normally we do everything indoors. At Float, you are enjoying the SoCal air while drinking, dancing, and having a great time. If you have been to the Hard Rock but didn't Float, make sure you do on your next visit. There are tons of hotels to stay at while visiting San Diego.

I stayed here in a Woodstock Suite with my wife for a fun getaway weekend in San Diego. I was very disappointed from the beginning. First they had only two staff checking in and checking out guests. Unfortunately there were several people doing both which resulted in a less than pleasant wait. Secondly, I did not see a single bellman available to help us with our luggage. As for the hotel it is in need of some serious care. Going up to our room I noted a room sign which was taped on the wall by the room with Blue Tape. Our room showed additional signs of old age ranging from a rug with snags and serious wear to poorly mended tear in our curtains. The room also showed scuff marks on the walls throughout and just a sense of age. As for the pool area and outside bar it showed similar signs including gapping holes in the deck furniture, weather worn decks, and tables as well as worn finishes on the concrete. All of this was disappointing and well below the standards that the Hard Rock has set and maintains at it's other properties. Also the I found it a big turnoff to return to my room on several occasions to see the same room service trays in the hall that where there some 12 plus hours ago. I can live with the noise and parties that are typical for the SD Hard Rock but at least make me feel like I am staying at a true 4 Diamond AAA hotel and not some worn out resort south of the border. I am torn about returning since there are so many other great hotels in SD to stay at that are just as cool.

The primary purpose of our trip was to attend a couple of Padres games. We found a good rate on one of the hotel consolidator websites - and called the hotel to ask a question about the rate. I was told the hotel would match the rate - it was nice dealing with the hotel on the reservation and not through a third party. I had e-mailed the hotel before our trip to ask for a quiet room. We were assigned room 1228 and this room, on the top floor, clearly met our needs. Our room had a view of Petco Park - which was great considering our trip was a baseball trip. We did stay Wednesday through Friday nights - we had no noise issues at all. The hotel was generally quiet on Wednesday and Thursday nights - Friday night had a lot going on but it was still quiet in our room. The beds were comfortable, the pillows were soft. The flat screen TV set to music when we first entered - a nice touch. The room was not large, but not especially cramped. The air conditioning worked fine - although San Diego was very temperate when we visited. The bathroom was larger than many hotel bathrroms, although counter space was limited. The sink was large, the shower had excellent water pressure. The towels were plush and the toiletries were good. A few things could have been better: The desk area was very small and the snacks and alcohol for sale took up much of the room that was available. There were only two drawers for clothes along with an armoire attached to the wall. We had luggage for 12 nights - it was somewhat crowded in our room. We had numerous wi-fi issues. The hotels home page was taking 80 seconds to load. We visited the concierge to ask what could be done better and her answer was to \"visit the coffee shop across the street.\" At $17 per night for the \"in-charge\" fee this answer was totally unacceptable. We eventually e-mailed the assistant manager of the hotel in an attempt to get a resolution. We were advised that there was a problem with the router on our floor, that their tech group had fixed it and that the $17 per night charge would be reversed from our bill. The internet was much faster but still hesitated. We were grateful for the response for the manager, but the flippant answer from the concierge led us not to use it again. The hotel coffee shop was similar to many of the restaurants we found in the Gaslamp Quarter - very expensive. We never did eat there as they did not serve lunch early enough for our daily schedule and were closed by the time we returned in the evening. The hotel was only two blocks from Petco Park - very convenient. The trolley stops outside the front door of the hotel - again very convenient. Would I stay here again if I returned to San Diego? Yes, but I would also price shop - there are many hotels nearby. We really looked forward to visiting this hotel more than any of the other five on our trip. Maybe we built it up too much before we arrived - it was very good - but it clearly wasn't the best or our favorite (Omni San Francisco far exceeded the Hard Rock).", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Somerville, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cHard Rock ROCKS!\u201d", "Author": "crikkle", "ReviewID": "UR117915427", "Content": "The hotel has an awesome vibe, and the staff is excellent.

The private terrace was 8ft by 6 ft wi wicker sofas over looking a large blank concrete space with cheap astroturf on it. The sofas were full of cigarette holes and each morning were hosed down with a strong bleach solution, is meant the cushions were wet all day and couldn't be used and at the terrace smelt like a public toilet. Each day we have to replace the cushions and reset the terrace ourselves - the cleaning teams didn't return to do is. When we did use our \"private\" terrace for the first few days we watched engineers and members of staff from the hotel setting up tables, bars for an event just at the end of our terrace - not very private. On the last day of our honeymoon from 8 am there were people outside our terrace setting up an event - we were blessed with listening to the staff shouting to each other and we caught to catch up on all their personal gossip as they chatted away - again not very private. At 3 pm the event started and 200-300 people in party mode appeared at the end of our private terrace (which had a rope place across the end - not sure if this was to keep us in or them out). They had a great time firing t-shirts out of air canons drinking and eating.

We spoke to the hotel on the friday and at checkout ultimately they just offered platitudes and seemed to think it was our job to offer them a solution to our dissatisfaction. The guy I spoke to was nice enough but he was more interested in getting a complaining customer out of his lobby than really dealing with the problem. In the end they waived the resort fee and gave us $130 off the bill - but they just didn't get the fact that was inadequate - this was our honeymoon - ultimately they didn't care. We had various other service issues with unreturned concierge calls and it was a disappointing end to our honeymoon.

We stayed here 5 days from from August 13 to August 18. My boy friend now fiancee proposed to me in our rock star suite on the first night!! FLIGHT: We flew from Toronto via Air Canada. Everything was on time. No in flight meal included but they sell sandwiches on board and snacks and offer free beverages. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich it was decent. ARRIVAL: San diego airport wasn't as busy as I expected and nothing spectacular. We needed a taxi to the hotel so when you head out follow the signs and theres a booth with a person dispatching taxis on a first come first serve basis. So no need to haul down or call ahead they do all the work for you and there is a slew of taxis outside waiting for customers. CHECK IN: As we pulled up the vallets welcomed us and helped us take out our luggage from the taxi and portered it to the check in desk. As we entered the hotel was pretty busy with others checking in and they were playing rock music in the background. The concerige lady was really nice but we were early so the room wasn't ready yet. Check in wasnt until 4pm and we were there at 1pm. She took our cell number and said she would call us when the room was ready if we wanted to go out have a bite to eat or explore around. Across the street was a fish taco restaurant called Tin Fish so we just headed over there. The concerige tagged our suitcases and kept it behind the desk for us. When we returned from lunch the concerige called us over to let us know our room was ready and the porter brought our suitcases up shortly after. ROOM: We stayed in a Rock Star Suite on the 7th Floor room 701 it was at the end of the hallway. The room completely knocked our socks off! Just gorgous!! The bathroom had duel shower heads with a beautiful bowl sink. The living room had white leather couches, flat screen tv with bose surround sound system and was playing house music when we entered just as we requested. The bedroom had a huge comfy bed with 4 plush pillows and another flat screen tv. The floor to ceiling windows that surrounded the entire left side of the room back wall was gorgous. Our room overlooked float and the pool and we could see the convention centre. Just beautiful views. The mini bar was stocked with alcohol and pop/juice as well as snack foods and wine. PEOPLE: All the staff here were amazing. They were all spunky and upbeat and very polite. They all went the extra mile to help us out. A room service girl brought me up chips on the house because I thought they came with the meal and she said no probelm i'll just send some up! Special shout out to Courtney who made our stay extra special always greeting us with a warm smile and helpful tips. She helped my fiancee plan out how to propose and sent us up chocolate covered strawberries and a lovely card. Brian who brought us room service also a very sweet guy and sent us a bottle of champagne to celebrate. Our housekeeper greeted us everyday and left our room spotless! THE FOOD: Room service at this hotel is amazing! They have a wide selection of apps, sandwiches, hot entrees, snacks, desserts, and drinks. We ordered a magarita pizza which came hot and bubbly super good! We also had the grilled cheese which came with a tomato and leek bisque (loved this soup) and homemade chips (best chips ever) and we paid $2 extra for the fries. Room service is pricey total worth it because the portions are HUGE and the food always came quickly and piping hot! You can just leave your tray outside the room or call roomservice to pick it up for you. We also dined at Nobu (located in the lobby) which is fusion and japenese cuisine. Amazing food and gorgous restaurant! We also ate at Mary Janes once for breakfast.....typical breakfast. ENTERTAINMENT: FYI this is a PARTY hotel! The party never stops here something is always going on. I don't recommened this hotel for those who want to go to bed early or have small children. Saturday night the club 207 is packed you can come early and pay cover (free if your in a rock star suite) and get your hand stamped and then come in through the VIP entrance later on. Sunday is there pool party called Intervention with a live DJ and the whole pool deck and back of the hotel is jam packed with young adults drinking in bikinis and partying. LiL John was the guest DJ when we were there and it was SooOoo much FuNNN everyone was going crazy!! The pool and hot tub is very beautiful they say you have to pay to rent a day bed but if you go during the week its pretty dead and you sit anywhere. They have a gym which is pretty small which we never used. Definately head outside 5th avenue is always lively and jam packed with beautiful restaurants and shops, go to pecto park and see the Padres, the San Diego is a short taxi ride away and definately worth the visit, the horton plaza mall is a short walk away and a lovely outdoor mall. NOTES: Overall a fabulous Hotel with amazing service and staff. Definately a party hotel and situated in a beautiful area with popping night life.

To get to your room, you have to show your hotel key, then board and elevator and use your hotel key to select a room. A bit of a pain, especially when your key stops working. Once in the room, its impressive at first. You do feel like you are staying in a room in an Ikea showroom. Its very small but cozy. The bathrooms are right out of ikea as well. The showers suck. Very little water pressure and just not set up well. Its a rain fall set up, which doesnt work well with little water pressure. So on noise. The rooms aren't bad in terms of noise, but you can hear it from downstairs if a band is playing. The drums are a bit loud. The pool area is really small. It is a want to be vegas setup. But is very cozy. We went down their for outrageously priced drinks. The music sucked. It was basically bad house music with no real differences. the atmosphere was ok, but again, music was really bad. I hear sundays have great pool parties. We did run into little jon, who was playing on sunday, but didnt stay to check it out. In terms of location and view. Location is ok as it is at the start of the gas lamp. But honestly, you can stay pretty much anywhere else cheaper and have a similar experience. The View was horrible as you can only see the convention center. There is a perk of getting in free to the clubs if you stay. But honestly wasnt worth it given the music. The DJ's were really bad. Also on dining, stay away from dicks. That place was horrible.

Mary Janynes had the most incredible breakfast try the Bannana Fosters french toast and the Hash! Nobu sushi and all of the night clubs were awesome. Petco park is 1/2 a block away. We can't wait to come back to the Hard Rock.... A special thanks to Eli!!

I stayed in the Black Eyed Pea Suite and it was great. The shower had 2 shower heads and I could of stayed in there forever. I will stay there every time I go to San Diego.

Before arriving we were concerned as it is not your typical business meeting location.

We were placed in a king suite near the elevator and we thought this might be noisy, but the room was very quiet despite being near the elevator. This part of the city is very busy all the time, but the rooms are quiet. The suite was very nice; with a sitting area on one side and bedroom on the other separated by the bathroom - very cool layout. The staff was always professional, pleasant, always helpful and friendly. Had room service for breakfast each morning; always arrived quickly and food was outstanding. You also have to try Nobu the Japanese restaurant in the hotel. We ate three three times over our 6 day stay; it was outstanding. There is also so much to do in this area of San Diego, great shopping, restaurants, and next to the ball park, so we took in a ball game one afternoon. The only con was that the internet connection was very slow throughout the hotel - which is hard when you are there on business and need to stay connected.

We travelled down to San Diego from Annaheim, and got there at about 1130am - check in was not supposed to be until 3pm. Thankfully, the staff at the hotel were happy to check us in early. At the check in desk we were asked what kind of music we enjoyed, which made sense once we got up to the room and the TVs were set to play music based on our preferences (a nice touch!) I really liked the room - we had a room on the third floor that consisted of a big king sized bed, a separate sofa/lounge area (with TVs in each area) and a bathroom & shower. The only thing I did not like about the room was the fact that the toilet door, and shower wall & door were both see through. Granted they were not 100% clear, but there was still enough to see who was inside of each room and what they were doing! I'm not sure if this was deemed to be trendy, but this was my main dislike about the rooms! The hotel itself was only a block away from Petco Park where the Padres play - we went to watch a game on our first day there. It was also extremely close to a number of bars and restaurants on the main streets of San Diego. The decor of the hotel seemed nice - I liked the memorabilia as you get with other Hard Rock locations. We ate at Mary Jane's once on our stay and this was a pleasant visit. The portion sizes were huge though and we had to ask for a container to take our uneaten food back up to the hotel room. We did not drink at any of the bars - 207, although loud when we went past seemed very empty (This was a Thursday night). We visited the pool once on our stay, but the atmosphere was not quite as relaxing as I'd have liked - really it's like a party pool with lots of young, hip adults drinking in the pool etc. This didn't offend me, but I could understand why it would put of any families with younger children, or older guests who would be staying at the hotel Overall though I'd still recommend the hotel - it was a pleasant stay and I'd happily stay there again!", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cWhat an Awesome Time!\u201d", "Author": "CSF18768", "ReviewID": "UR115232070", "Content": "Anytime I go back to San Diego, I will stay at The Hard Rock Hotel.

Be careful about what room you get. Here, the suites seem to mean that they are not overlooking the courtyard/club. All other rooms are. We were initially in one of those loft rooms and even on a Thursday it was terrible. The courtyard turns into a club and the noise level is tremendous. It's like there is a party in your room - it is SO loud. I finally decided to upgrade to a suite and that was not handled well. For 4 hours my husband was told it was \"about to happen\" which meant he wasted most of the day waiting and wasn't able to leave the hotel. If they had been honest and said \"we'll move you at 2\" he could have at least left the hotel. They provided a pack n' play for our daughter with a nice kit of Johnson and Johnson products which was a nice touch but this is clearly not a hotel geared towards families. I was excited about the pool but it's a party pool. I wouldn't have been comfortable bringing a child into the pool. Not because it wasn't safe but because the other people there are in a party frame of mind. At many other hotels this wouldn't have been an issue. Friday and Saturday night there were parties ALL OVER the hotel in private rooms and therefore a lot of drunk people all over the hotel. The suite rooms are definitely worth the upgrade and the sound proofing is far superior to other hotels. Additionally, the fact that you have to use your card in the elevator is really annoying. There seems to be an expectation from other people using the elevator that you will use your card to let them up. If you are in your 20's (or a 20's frame of mind) this hotel would be great.

The hotel was amazing. We had the king suite with a balcony overlooking Petco Field. The Gaslamp area is so fun with all the options for dining and clubbing, but be wary it is pricey! I Loved our 'custom' music that we had in our room and the two large flat screens. The bathroom setup was a little 'funky' to me... the room was a rectangle - you enter in the living area, then in the middle was the shower on one side and the toilet on the other side (both enclosed with etched glass doors of course) and the sink in the middle of them. Then you passed through there to get to the bed and balcony. You would have a problem if anyone has 'digestive' issues, because you can definitely hear everything. I would stay here again just for the INTERVENTION Sunday! It was 'OFF THE CHAIN - CRAZY GOOD!' DJ's spinning, dancing, drinking... Although the weather got a little drizzly, it didn't seem to affect the party atmosphere! I would ask for the package and get a room that faced the rooftop pool. the breakfast place had great food and the choice to 'grab & go' if you didn't have time. The rooftop pool/bar (location of the Intervention Sunday), great views and lots of room just to mingle if you didn't want to get wet. The dance club 207 was so fun, contemporary music and great DJ's again! We didn't get a chance to try the sushi place, so I don't have anything to say about that. There is a room charge for the wireless, kind of like the same fee you pay for in Vegas and such.

We weren't ready to pay $400 a night so the lady at the desk asked us to hang on a moment and she'd talk to her manager. She came back and offered us the same suite but at the studio rate of $295 a night. We took it. She was very kind and accommodating. I had also printed off a coupon for $75 hotel credit for each night of your stay. She still accepted the hotel credit coupon and applied that to our bill as well. They put us in a beautiful suite on the top floor in a nice quiet corner. The view from our room looked right into Petco Park and we loved walking to restaurants in the area.

Convention rooms were comfortable, centrally located, and all equipment we needed, from sound systems, to meals, to screens and projectors worked as promised. Also, a tiny detail, I love the one touch call for everything I needed in my room, Ground Control was all I needed to contact other rooms, ask questions about service and facilities, or check on extending my checkout.

When it comes to food, you have the best of both worlds. Starting with a modern twist to the classic dinner, but with great quality food at decent prices. Then you have your upscale restaurant (what i consider the best in sushi anywhere)...Nobu !! An elegant, but nice place to hang out at the bar, or eat good food. To top it off, you also have a pinkberrry (if you don't know what that is, well, where have you been living ? LOL). If you like the night life, it has a bar/club downstairs at the lobby; or the rooftop bar/lounge. Both places seem to be the place to be at in San Diego. There were long lines outside just to get in ! I also spent a couple ours at the Spa. WOW...it was relaxing. They also have the pool upstairs.

Let me say that this is a top notch hotel... the hotel is very modern, the rooms are very nice, the staff is well trained and extremely helpful and polite. Everyone (with the exception of one Valet- who was an idiot) was great. The staff is very young so it is impressive that the service was so above standard... it renews your faith in the younger generation in some ways. Having said that, as a family of five with children under 12, we'd probably never go back here. We stayed at this hotel because we had a room there free of charge through an art auction company who was holding an event at the hotel. The hotel is filled with young drunk people 24/7. I will say they've insulated the walls very well because other than hearing them come down the corridors, we heard nothing from the adjacent rooms even though there were 20+ people going in and out at all hours. I'm not sure what happened in one of the elevators on Saturday night, but on Sunday they had stationed an elevator attendant on each lift because of an \"issue\" that took place the night before. I'm happy the hotel responded appropriately to whatever that event was and took steps to correct it by staffing the elevator... but weren't surprised there was an event given the large number of young partiers staying at the hotel. If I were 20 years younger (I'm 42) this would be the place I want to be, but I'm too old to worry about getting puked on or bashed into by someone unable to walk without assistance. Sigh. Despite the fact that we are not the target demographic here... I have to say that overall we had a very good experience. The staff treated us great even though they were probably completely confused as to why we were staying there with 3 kids. The pool was a bar scene from about mid day well into the night but despite that, the security staff went out of their way (A gentleman named Alaska in particular) to make us feel welcome and specifically told us if anyone had \"any problems\" with the kids there swimming to just let him know and he would \"take care of it.\" We felt welcome and were treated very well by the staff- I can't say it enough, the staff really is well trained and did a great job throughout our stay. The hotel location is the BEST we've ever had in San Diego. You are a city block from Petco Park, across the street from the Convention Center and on the corner of the start of the Gaslamp district. There are a lot of homeless around and quite a lot of unsavory types... I've been to NYC and DC and couldn't believe how much cleaner and safer those cities were compared to downtown San Diego. (That is a city of San Diego issue, not a Hard Rock hotel issue, however.) City of San Diego needs to do a better job with getting uniformed officers on the street down there... tons of cops in cars, but they need them on bikes/horseback/foot like the other big cities do to really police that area better. (We had no problems, however, there was a random shooting--husband shot his wife- in the gaslamp quarter six blocks from the hotel in broad daylight the weekend we were there. Also- the coceierge at the hotel adamantly advised against riding the SD trolley light rail near or after nightfall.... it just isn't safe, she said.) Our first room had a window looking out toward the convention center. We moved to a slightly larger room for $30 more which had a sliding glass door with a rail (not really a balcony, but you could open the sliders and look out) and the room was MUCH nicer with a small sitting area, couch and two TVs rather than one. Pay the $30 more for the room with the sliding glass door... it is nice to take in the city and well worth the money for the updgrade. Food: The food at Nobu was gross... how does anyone eat there? The breakfast at Maryjanes was good but VERY expensive. Room service was also pricey, but good food and we were hungry so no complaints there. Overall- we enjoyed our stay but I would only recc this hotel to someone single and under 35 looking to drink, party and meet people.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEeeh not too impressed\u201d", "Author": "baker6", "ReviewID": "UR108208841", "Content": "Having stayed at the Hard Rock inVegas I was expecting the same uber cool hip vibe and although the hotel is very modern and cool in decor its very small and cramped.

As expected, the hotel is very modern with a strong musical theme. We didn't expect old world elegance, and we were fairly pleased with the decor. We were not pleased with the hospitality, or lack there of. On our first night, there was a halloween in april themed party in the club on the first floor. The party was a disappointment. Overpriced drinks, no energy, etc. We left after a short time. When we approached the elevator to go to our room, we were stopped by an attendant. My wife produced her hotel key and the attendant stared at it with a blank look. The key was not the standard key but a specialty key produced for the ACP convention. The attendant asked several questions about the key in a tone suggesting he didn't believe us. He finally relented and allowed us to return to our room. On another occasion, my wife had a drink in a plastic cup that the bartender said she could take to her room if she wished. The same attendant again stopped her and told her she couldn't take the drink to her room. Upon her insistence, he allowed her to pass. Another night, we returned to the hotel after a late dinner. The entrance was roped off and a burly bouncer as manning the entrance. He turned away a person just ahead of us. He then turned his attention to a co-worker who he appeared to be chatting with. After waiting for almost a minute, we stepped over the rope. When he turned his attention back to us, I showed him my room key. Instead of apologizing for inconveniencing a hotel guest, he said to me \"next time, please wait for me to open the ropes\". Both my wife and I felt that was very rude and inappropriate.

Although I thought it was going to be above my budget, I gave them a call. The Hard Rock was affordable so I happily booked the room. I liked the fact that Hard Rock sent me info about San Diego. Also suggested I book their restaurants ahead of time to make sure I get in since they are so popular. Well, it was my niece's birthday and not knowing what she wanted to eat or where, the Hard Rock was right, they were booked.

After that we spent some time in the gaslamp district and horton plaza which is all within walking distance. When we got back to our room we enjoyed the awesome rain shower in the very stylish bathroom and then headed downstairs to Nobu for dinner. Our server and her team at Nobu provided probably the best service we have ever had at a restaurant, it was perfect, not too much and everything was always filled, cleaned or addressed, just incredible! You have to try the Pina Martini...yummmmy! After dinner we walked across the lobby to 207 for a night cap (we had Ruby Tuesday Martini...very good and fresh) and to relax a bit then back up to the room where we slept like babies! The next morning we went down again to Marryjane's for breakfast (which is my favorite place to have breakfast anywhere) and they did not disappoint the 3 egg omlett and their special potatoes are to die for (I am getting hungry just writting about it :o) Overall Awesome experience and we will be back for sure!!!

Our last trip to an SD hotel was horrific (Andaz aka The Ivy) so finding a hotel my mother would feel very comfortable in, was challenging to say the least. I suggested several hotels (Hard Rock being one, as my company held a large event and have previous booke many rooms here during Comic-Con) she settled on The Hard Rock. I decided to surprise my mom with a suite upgrade and massage gift card at arrival and the staff whom I spoke with (Janelle) were fantastic and very attentive. Service in the VIP area (Chris & \"E\") when my mom arrived was awesome and she treated amazingly. One damper When she got to her suite it had not been cleaned completely. Which is a big no no. When she called house keeping they came immediately and when she complained to the front desk they were mortified and personally made sure the room was spotless. Tho, the living room area (Rm#1260)had a faint smell of mildew/mold near the shower. Which I didn't bring up, as I didn't want to be the pain in the butt guests. Upon my arrival everyone was very friendly and VERY service oriented and that attitude continued during my drama of losing my iPhone (between valet and the room my) Everyone from the bells, valet, VIP, security and the front desk staff was awesome in helping me to hopefully locate my phone, which never turned up. The staff went above and beyond in searching for it and stayed very patient when still the next day we continued asking the staff about phone.

First off, valet costs $35 (there is no self-parking at the hotel)! I asked if I could pay cash for the room since I had just spent two weeks in Hawaii and did not want to run up the credit card so I left a cash deposit at check-in. I also then discovered that they charge a $17 resort fee for use of the internet, gym and pool. Even though I told them we were not going to use these services I was told we had to pay it. I stopped in at their restaurant, Mary Jane's and stood at the bar to get a drink for the room. I sat at the bar for 20 minutes and no one helped me so I went to the room to join my wife. I got to our king suite and was suprised by how small the room. Online, the room was described as a three room suite but it was much smaller. I turned on both TVs and one was working and on the other was nothing but static. I wanted to check out the halo lights behind the bed but they did not work so I called the front desk to report the tv and the halo lights they said they would have the engineer fix the problem. I went downstairs to go back to Mary Jane's and noted that there was strong odor of vomit near the elevators (my wife smelled it as well). We smelled it every time we went out. I again tried to get a drink.at Mary Jane's and this time after 10 minutes a waiter told the bar was not serving even though two people were there having a drink. My wife walked in the bar at that time so we walked over to the Omni hotel for a drink in their bar. Later that night when we got back to the hotel after a great Thanksgiving dinner at McCormick & Schmick's at the Omni Hotel we went to our room. The TV was still fuzzy but the bed halo lights were on with a note saying it had been fixed. Now it was late and time for bed and guess what? The extremely bright halo lights now would not turnoff behind the bed! After trying to sleep without success we called the front desk at 2:30 a.m. They said an engineer would be ip to fix the light. He never showed. My wife and I got no sleep that night. Upon checkout they told us we had a credit balance due to us. Then the front desk said they do not give cash refunds and they need my credit card to put on the money due to me. The front desk said nothing of this upon check in. I have contacted the manager directly to report my disappointment with our stay. All I received back was an e-mail stating he was sorry the experience was less than stellar and to let us know if we were ever back in the hotel again. He knows we are from the San Diego area and made no effort to make an offer for us to come back or anything. I would expect this response from a one-star hotel, but not a four-star hotel like the Hard Rock. My wife and I are gonig back to downtown San Diego soon and will be staying at the Omni where I am a platinum member and have had great service. The sign of a four-star hotel is what they do when something goes wrong not when all is good. This hotel fell short in every way. Stay here if you want a dirty, horrible hotel that is poorly managed.

I told her my name which she remembered for my entire visit and was always ready to offer a friendly greeting when she saw me. This was not a random occurrence as the entire staff was extremely friendly, offering both advice on great running trails and the best night spots on any given evening. My room was beautiful, clean and quiet. I used the Rock Gym daily and as a gym snob was pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of equipment in the facility. I dined at Nobu, ordered to go coffee from Maryjanes and met my friends at 207 for cocktails. Each experience was fantastic.

I am not a vodka drinker but it still made me smile. The hotel bars are all excellent locations to meet up with clients in a sophisticated yet informal location. Don't get too comfortable going to just one of the bars in the hotel because they are all unique, well-stocked and have great ambience. My favorite is the Float bar on the 4th floor that combines the hotel's swimming pool, hot tub, cabanas and huge sectional setting areas around aquamarine stone fire pits to take the chill off at night.

The rooms (called studios but they are not studio apartment layouts) are pretty basic but stylish. The service training was nearly non existent with the front desk particularly surly and unhelpful even with the most basic questions. Whenever I spoke with someone on the staff, it seemed as if I was interrupting their day. The hotel restaurant has decent enough food, but all the servers looked like it was their first day on the job. My server brought me the wrong check two times. I really, really wanted to like this property, but their too cool for you mindset, poor service training, unimpressive amenities and the lack of an experience that didn't come anywhere close to my expectations will have me going elsewhere next time.

My room overlooked the lobby canopy and faced the convention center. Hallways were dark brown, lit by flourescent lights and seemed cheap compared to the room furnishings. The small rooftop pool was sufficient for laps and was surrounded by about 8 queensized loungers for sunning. The small pool deck was adjacent to the bar making this area very loud with music, drinking and socializing. Not really an environment for family kiddie play on weekends. The gym was decent in size and had a variety of aerobic and weight machines. Guests could access the sauna inside the Spa but only by paying a fee and only when the Spa was open. The hotel and Gaslamp district in general are party central on weekends, so those wanting to sleep early best avoid the area.

The TV got messed up every time we connected our iPod to the a/v cables at the TV/media center. Basically we could never watch TV. The room speakers sucked, which was hard to believe considering we were at the HARD ROCK. Rooms are poorly designed, from the bed edges that you scrape your leg on, to the bathroom door that slams your fingers if you hold it while closing, to the shower door that has no handle on the inside so it's hard to close. It's a constant balancing act of stuff not to fall down or readjusting. The pool area is relaxing, if you can get one of the little couches.The pool is miniscule and basically everyone just stands in it for many hours at a time. You do the math. The hot tub was ok but after 8 people were in it, it got crowded.The bouncers at the club are snotty, but the lady at the pool lounge entrance was really nice. you get in free to the clubs from 9-10 if you're staying at the hotel. Make sure guys are not wearing flip-flops because they will NOT get in. we stayed for about 30 minutes and left...pretty boring.

As an added bonus, I was given a code for 10 free iTunes downloads...Rock On! The main hotel areas are very clean with lots of song lyrics from artists posted on the walls as well as music memorabilia in display cases. The elevator, to my suprise, was key card access so that you couldn't go up to the guest rooms without a key. Now the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance was the room. Very chic/european styled room with lots of great little Hard Rock touches including a pillowcase with a guitar embroidered on it. As I mentioned before, classic rock was playing through the TV which was integrated into a great modern entertainment center with from AV jacks to hook up whatever your heart desired to the TV. The most impressive thing about the room was the bathroom. Not only was is super swanky with a glass enclosed stand up shower with 2 heads (rain, regular), it had to have been the cleanest hotel bathroom I've ever set foot in. All the glass for the shower enclosure was spotless...WOW! The bars downstairs serve up any drink you desire...but you should definitely try the raspberry mojito.

As I always do I have broken my review down into the Great, Good, Bad, and Ugly. I will also offer some bottom line-type comments. Ready? Here goes . . . GREAT * DESIGN - okay, the design environment of the Hard Rock San Diego (henceforth referred to as HRSD) is very 'manufactured' and we know it but this hotel is an excellent mix of chic and sophistication where business people, partiers, and vacationers blend seemlessly - nobody feeling out of place. I loved the giant screen backdrop to the registration counters as well as the unique design of the rooms - backlit trim and unique furniture and bar designs help make an otherwise standard footprint room unique. This holds true to the rest of the building and common areas as well - dramatic lighting, 3D prominent song lyric quotes, and eclectic design all mean that you will remember the HRSD long after your stay. * LOCATION - Whether you are in town for a trade show or to have fun, go ahead . . . just TRY to top this location. The hotel is just across the street from the convention center on one side, and almost under the iconic arch that signals the beginning of the gaslamp main drag on the other. And to yet another side . . . you are a pop fly's distance from Petco Park. GOOD * TEMPERATURE / SOUND - I mentioned the unique design of the rooms. But, that's not all. I found the room temperature controls to be excellent while running more quietly than most. And . . . I had to unfortunately participate in an impromtu conference call from my room in the early a.m. and found the room to be highly sound proof. I didn't hear toilets or TVs from other rooms and nobody had to hear me talking about TPS reports and mission statements from their room. * SHOWER - The shower was fantastic with two dual-angle shower heads. Use either or both. * SERVICE - As noted, the hotel's chic design is all very manufactured. But, the HRSD is NOT just a mediocre hotel dressed up with a 'gimmick' . . . I still found this to be a highly effective business class hotel with excellent service, friendly staff, and a great business center. And, you won't feel 'price gouged' here either. They offer free internet access in-room and in the business center - this really saved me with that conference call I had to take part in. BAD (room for improvement) * ACCESS - The check in / out times of 4 pm / 11 am seem a tad restrictive to a HRSD guest who may be just trying to enjoy a few days of leisure. In most cases where I encounter late check-in times, I have been able to check in early but that was not the case at the HRSD - and it looked like they were far from booked in-full. The front desk person(s) did offer to call me via cell when they had a room ready so this may have been an isolated incident. * LIGHTING - While the room's illumination options are multiple - and very cool - even with all going to once you may find the room poorly lit at night. They do offer a cool bed backboard flexible snake light for late reading. UGLY * Based on the great location at the foot of the gaslamp district you may hear some drunken revelry and the occasional crackling police p.a. in the small hours. Of course, if you're one of those drunken revelers this shouldn't bother you. BOTTOM LINE * You will not regret your decision to stay at the HRSD - the overwhelmingly positive reviews here in a negative world speak volumes. * As a guitar player, I love to see all of those artist-signed and used axes. That and the hotel stylings make the HRSD a nice departure from the hotel norm. * The most important hotel review question is this - \"in a similar circumstance, would I stay there again?\" - that is an easy 'yes' for me.

I was wrong, the music could be heard until after 2:00am, and then the noisy drunks were running up and down our hall yelling and being loud until after 2:30am. The noisy drunks, I cannot blame on the hotel, because you will find those at any \u201cparty\u201d hotel. I just wish that I would have realized what a party hotel this was before we booked our vacation here. Other then the noise and lack of sleep, this is a very nice hotel. The lobby was clean and open, it felt very welcoming. Our room was very clean and quite spacious. The bathroom was quite large and had a lovely rain shower, however, you must note that the products in our bathroom were not Aveda, that I could tell, they were their Spa brand, again not a complaint, just a note. The hotel is in a great location. We were able to walk up and down the streets in the Gas Lamp district to find shops and restaurants. We also walked to Sea Port Village, about a mile walk, not bad at all. It's also a nice little walk over to the Convention Center and from there you can get to the marina to take the ferry over to Coronado. So, the location really is ideal!

The place is Uber-Chic and totally styled like you would expect a Hard Rock hotel to be. But wait... I am getting a bit ahead of myself. First of all, I would like to mention the way the reservation was handled. It was professional and they even asked what type of music I wanted playing in my room when I arrived (which it was). Between making my reservation and actually staying at the hotel, I received several emails (albeit automatically generated) reminding me of my stay and options to book a spa visit, question what is going on in the area, etc. I have never had this kind of attention from a hotel, and I for one... liked it. Okay, so I arrive and the line to get valet parking was kind of busy, so I parked across the street in the public parking and save myself some money ($21 per day vs. $35 per day at the hotel... although no in/out priveleges). When I arrived, my room was ready and clean. When I checked out the room, it was very stylish. There was a HUGE screen TV and some interesting architectural items like a small little \"Peek-a-boo\" window behind the mini-bar that looked straight into the bathroom... specifically in to the shower. Given that this was a single King bed room, I would imagine that they figured out that either one person was staying here or, at least, two people who knew each other quite well and would not mind watching each other shower. Again... totally cool... and totally Hard Rock. Just a couple other things about the room. First of all, no tub. Shower only [albeit with a terrific \"rain\" shower head]. Apparently rock stars don't like to soak. AND... the room, although totally \"techy\" has no DVD player. Disappointing. I brought Netflix DVDs with me to watch and when I couldn't find a DVD player in the room I called the front desk (\"chic-ly\" called \"Ground Control\" at the hotel) and asked about a DVD player. Yes, they have them, but at a cost of $100 per night! Too pricey for me. Now I am not the usual Hard Rock \"demographic\" as I am close to 50 years of age, but the Hard Rock staff made me feel comfortable nonetheless. The hotel is about a block away from Petco Park so if you are going to catch a Padres game, the location is PERFECT. The only complaint I had, and it is not the Hard Rock's issue, was that the people across from my room were very, very noisey and loud... usually until 2 or 3 in the morning. They were apparently there for a Bachelor/Bachelorette party and well, it was the Hard Rock so they were partying like... well, rock stars! It made getting to sleep and staying asleep a little challenging, but I made it through. Which brings me to my final point. If you go, and you really should, request a room on a higher floor. There is the 207 Lounge on the first floor and they party there quite late into the evening/early morning. I heard them quite a bit and I was on the 8th floor, so I can only imagine that it would be pretty much unbearable on a lower floor. But in any case, the Hard Rock lived up to its expectations as a cool, hip, trendy location. The staff appears to be well trained and the rooms well designed.

He was super nice, I ran into him a few more times during our stay and he would always greet us and ask how things were going. We were in a suite. A pretty awesome sweet. I believe it was called the Black Eyed Peas Suite. It ran about 330.00 a night. I am very glad that my wife's company was picking up the bill. I loved the shower with the two spray heads. One normal and the other coming down from the ceiling. The decorations were pretty awesome. Loved the contemporary feel. We slept very well in the beds and found the reading lamps very cool and useful. We had a view facing downtown and the Gaslamp area. It was cool to look out at night and see everything going on. Everything is so lit up. If I looked over the balcony and too the left I could see an aircraft carrier in the harbor. If I looked to the right, I could see part of Petco field. There were games going on two of the nights we were there. It got loud when they scored. Not too loud. We kept the balcony doors open most of the time we were in the room except for when we were sleeping. When the doors were closed, we really didn't hear much except for an ocassional siren or horn. After a couple of days, I tried to get a pool view suite but since there was a huge conference in town, there were no rooms available. Got to check out the pool area a few times. Never swam. We hung out for a bit and did some people watching. There were several parties going on during our stay. If you want to party like a rockstar then this is the place to be. Seen a few celebrities in and around the hotel. It was pretty awesome. Didn't check out any of the restaurants in the hotel but they do have a yogurt place connected that was fabulous. We did try to eat at Mary Janes one night but they had already closed. FYI, there is a convenient store/deli around the corner that was very handy. We really had a great time at the hotel.

Check. Ridiculously big \"studio\" room? Check. MaryJane's perfect chocolate malt shake at 1 am? Check. Relaxed hubby? Priceless. We visited Hard Rock San Diego on April 9, 2010. The purpose of the trip was to thank my husband for being such a rock star through my cancer and IVF treatments, and to get in a tiny staycation before my hysterectomy on Monday. (I'm 34, story of it all here: www.casadefrias.com). In short, it's a perfect place for a one-night stand. VALET Upon arrival, the very professional, friendly valet staff made us feel welcome right away. They even got some waiting cabs to go around the block so we could move into the valet lane and get out of traffic quickly. Some people may say it's a tad pricey, but as a local I can say it's in line with what most places charge downtown. When CHECK-IN We were second in line, and checked in within 5 minutes. Props to Christian for his kindness and efficiency in getting us a great room on a high floor with a killer view of the bay. ROOM This is where it gets ridiculous. We booked Hard Rock's smallest room, which they dub a \"Studio Room.\" Now I've traveled a lot (both in the States and international), and I know what a studio room looks like: 6-18 inches between the sides of the bed and wall, a bathroom you can barely turn around in. This hardly fit that bill. The room was overly spacious for 2 adults. They don't overstuff the room with unnecessary furniture. The bar and fridge are smartly tucked in the corner. The large shower easily holds 2 people (and there's no pesky tub to climb over). The bathroom is roomy enough that we were both able to get ready at the same time. DINING While we didn't eat at the sushi place (we couldn't, they were booked solid with reservations for the night), we did eat at Mary Janes, the throwback diner, twice. The first time was just a shake with fries/rings combo (get the dipping sauce, it's divine). The next morning we went for breakfast, and the Tijuana Benedict (pork) was inventive and delicious. Overheard at Mary Janes restaurant during breakfast: Dad, \"You really want berries on that?\" to which the child replied, \"Oh, what do I know, I'm 6.\" FINAL THOUGHTS From the moment you walk into the spacious, airy lobby, to when you leave, Hard Rock San Diego is a rock star experience.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cThese tips could really enhance your stay\u201d", "Author": "LBelle511", "ReviewID": "UR62282805", "Content": "My friend and I arrived on Tues evening and were booked for 2 nites. The front desk girl who checked us in asked us if we wanted a room with a balcony? Since I have never stayed there, I said yes. MISTAKE. It was a mistake due to the weather conditions for San Diego were cold, rainy, and windy for the days we were staying and there was really no need for the balcony whatsoever, as there was no one at pool or any reason anyone would even need the balcony with the upcoming weather conditions. When we arrived in our room 12th floor (their highest level) we had rm 1259. It is a corner room with very little space at all. The bathrm was very tiny and had no ventilation or fan whatsoever, and the door from the bathrom into the bedroom was located less than a ft. from the bedside. There was only a shower, so if you are in the mood for a bath , or have a lady with you, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS RM,,or you will be going downstairs to change it. The lighting was florescent and with the red walls, it wasnt the place for a girl to do her makeup at all. Thankfully there was a mirror located by the minibar in the front room, very awkward, but it saved me. The entire room may have been 600 sq ft.,that is with a queen size bed and 2 very uncomfortable sofas that looked more like fancy leather futons. The floor to cieling curtains looked great, but the electronic curtain/drape openers werent working...not one of them, so we didnt really fight at the blinds to see our great view and THE BALCONY<O JOY! I had an 80minute massage at their spa. The spa was very quiet and clean and pretty basic with not alot of frills, but nice just the same. The massage I would give a thumbs up. The ISSUE I had was the spa is located on the 3rd floor (which is on the same floor as other rooms are) and when I got off of the elevator, I could see no sign as to where on the floor the spa was, so I went searching. On 2 seperate occassions, we went into the 207club. The waitstaff is superfriendly and attentive. Our 2nd trip in , it was late afternoon and it was absolutely freeeZING and windy out.. IN SPITE of the frigid temperatures that were clearly cooling down the entire place, they left the door open. We were there for over an hr and could nt believe no one closed it..it was absurd and was certainly freezing up their waitstaff, as we were chilly ourselves even while wearing long sleeved coats. Just had to write these few things in hopes of letting everyone know these little quirks I encountered.

Its in a great location just across from the convention centre and harbour and around the corner there are loads of shops, bars and restaurants to entertain you as well as being handy for Seaworld and the Zoo. We stayed at the hotel at the end of November and although it was quite busy, the staff always took the time to make sure we were ok and offer assistance. As it was a special occasion, the room we booked was a Hard Rock Suite and it was massive. It had separate lounge, bedroom, bathroom and balcony. For the price it was fantastic. We treated ourselves to a dinner at Nobu to celebrate and it didnt disappoint. We were worried we wouldn't be able to get in at the last minute, but the hotel staff made all the arrangements for us - no problems . Maryjanes was, as mentioned on the blog we used, great for breakfast and the happy hour was well worth a visit - stuffed ourselves silly and had lots of yummy cocktails. We can see that 'in the season' or if a large event is on, the hotel could possibly get a bit swamped, but it is huge and with the large amount of staff and facilities so I'm sure they could cope, no problems. Its a very quick drive to Sea World and the Zoo, and with our car parked in the multi-storey across the street - thanks again http://casualconnoisseur.blogspot.com/ for the tip !, they also advised of the free wifi, which we used quite a bit.

The rooms were decorated with modern features but they didn't have practicality in mind while designing.

The worst problem by far is that I left my flat iron sitting on the vanity to cool on the second day of our stay. After we returned that night we noticed that the room had been cleaned which usually isn't an issue. We checked out the next day but quickly returned after realizing that I did not repack my flat iron into my luggage. I spoke to them in person and to multiple people over the phone everyday for one week today to try to remedy this situation but have yet to receive a phone call back from anyone.

A phone call should have fixed this. I waited in the shower and for approximately an hour before i got some conditioner.

The next morning we tried to call room service to order breakfast but nobody answered the phone. Additionally, the pool was tiny and filled with trashy people. I watched the staff repeatedly walk by an abandoned meal for over an hour while a huge seagull kept swooping in and stealing fries. I wouldn't swim in the pool or enter the hot tub for fear of contracting some type of disease.

It's one of the closest hotels to the conference center which made it a breeze going back and forth. Honestly the hotel was too funky for the purpose of my visit. On the plus side, the hotel is brand new and the public spaces, my room and bathroom were gleaming. I checked in around 10pm on a Sunday night and was checked in at a little podium (the hotel bucks the trend and doesn't have a traditional front desk). The guy checking me in looked like an underwear model; they definitely hire staff who fit the concept. The underwear model and I had to raise our voices as we exchanged information because the check-in area is adjacent to one of San Diego's hottest night clubs, which was in full swing and located off the hotel lobby. If I was here with friends, or for a bachelor party, or looking to whoop it up this would have been the place for me. Because I was in town for a conference and I had to have my corporate face on I felt out of place. My favorite touch was the flat screen TV. Hard Rock has several commercial-free radio stations playing and the ability to plug my iPod into it was great when working on my laptop (they supplied all the hook up wires). Pool was beautiful. Highlight was having drinks on the rooftop bar, sitting on long outdoor couches with coworkers, low to the ground with our feet up on the ledge of the fire pit getting toasty warm.

We left the room at 10am to get a brunch, then came back around 2pm and the room wasn\u2019t cleaned yet. We left again and came back around 4pm and it still was cleaned so we told the front desk about it. We came back around 6pm and it was finally cleaned. I loved the double shower heads, pretty cool.

I believe it is a newer hotel. The d\u00e9cor is like you would expect for a Hard Rock; modern and sleek. The layout of the room was nice. I will point out a few of the issues I had while staying there. First, I was only on the 5th floor facing the convention center. I know my entire company was at the hotel so I know it was full. The issue being on the 5th floor is the club noise from the bar in the hotel named 207. Every night there are a ton of people at this bar and they can not smoke indoors. Hence, they stand on the sidewalk right out side my window. Additionally, there is a train that goes by about every hour. After one night I went and got ear plugs and the noise was no longer an issue. Most of my company meetings were on the 2nd or 4th floor. However, I could not find a stair well to take me down just one flight of stairs. They all appear to be fire stairwells. The first day before I knew this I had to walk all the way down to the ground floor and then ride the elevator back to the 4th floor. No big deal but a bit annoying to be forced to use the elevator. What distributed me more was all the clutter on the 2nd and 1st floor in the stair well. If they are truly fire stairs they should be clear. Overall the room was clean but the bathroom needed to be scrubbed a bit more. There was stray hair in the shower and water rings on the counter. Again not a huge deal but it does make you wonder why they are cutting corners. I also know for some people stray hair in the shower is a big deal so I thought I would mention it. For those of you planning a meeting here, hire an outside vendor. Do not use the in house crew. The general sessions we had were terrible. They were 1-10 getting the mics working on the first try. It actually became a joke with the presenters. I go to a ton of these things a year and this was the worst production I had seen in a very long time. Additionally, they were 0-3 getting video to work successfully the first time. Overall, it took away from the presentations. The things I liked. The bed was extremely comfortable and the sheets were the white 500 thread count. I also enjoyed the towels after the first day. They were thick and comfortable as well. It appears the first day I was given older non branded towel. Again, I know how booked the hotel was for the conference. The second day I had newer branded towels and they were wonderful. The shower has a rain shower head and a normal one. A bit of a luxury. I would also complement the catering staff. All the food in the breaks outs were delicious and healthy. The food that was served during lunch was good as well. One day we had a sit down family style lunch and the next a buffet. Breakfast was always a buffet and always stocked. For those not traveling on your company\u2019s dime be aware that WiFi is $15 a day. Additionally, the only parking at the hotel is valet at $25 a day. I did hear some peers parked down the street on their own at $15 a day. Overall I am glad I got to experience the Hard Rock. However, if I was going to travel to San Diego on my own dime I would stay somewhere else.

I had a suite with a balcony and a fantastic shower. I loved the amenities like iPod jack to play music through one of the two flat-screen TVs. The Hard Rock staff were very friendly and accommodating. I forgot my toothbrush, and after a call to the front desk, they sent up a replacement within five minutes. The hotel's public spaces are great, too. I particularly liked the Float bar on the fourth floor--after a long day of meetings, it was the perfect place to relax in front of the fire. In fact, my colleagues and I went there both evenings--coming from the Midwest and East Coast, we were thrilled to spend a few hours outside on the roof. When I travel, I don't tend to stick around the hotel too much, but that was not the case at the Hard Rock. I wish I could have had more time to hit Nobu or spend more time in the gym/spa.

Some places were open and were able to have a wonderful dinner and drinks. The next day, we planned on attending the Charger's Block Party that was only a block from the Hard Rock. The energy was building as fans started to arrive... The Hard Rock was becoming ground zero! We discovered some problems with our room's sound system and called the front desk. Two sound technicians were at our door in minutes and quickly found the loose cords! They were also Charger fans attending the block party later that night. My girlfriend and I stayed in a \"Rock Star\" suite and our friends in a \"Regular\" room. Both rooms were awesome with all toys for an adult's night out. We did see some families with children out for the holiday weekend, but we all agreed this property caters mainly to adults. Drinks at the two bars are a bit pricey...$10.00 for a cocktail??? No thanks we \"Brown bagged ours\". The Charger's Block Party was a blast, and later it seemed that everyone ended up by the pool at Float to continue into the night. All guests of the hotel can get on the VIP list to both clubs at the hotel. That will save you the $20.00 cover they try to charge... you'll need it for the drinks! That's downtown I guess.

The weekend can simply be summarized as, well....fantastic! I normally don't give reviews 5's across the board, but this place deserved it. Check-In - fast, courteous, and very friendly check-in. Derek did an awesome job at making us feel welcome from the moment we reached the property, and remembered us even the next day. Great customer service! Rooms - we had two studio rooms. One overlooking the pool and the other overlooking the Padres's stadium. 10th floor was nice and our room had a small patio on it with two chairs and a table...great place to hang out while getting ready for the evening and watching the action at the pool. Clean, contemporary, straight lines and soothing color scheme. Great shower and Aveda products to boot. 50\" Hi-Def TV with about a dozen music channels to listen to. Room service is complete around 3-4 PM. On-premise food / beverages - MaryJane's is a diner on the first floor. Great food at reasonable prices. They have an awesome happy hour with drinks about 1/2 price as compared to the other bars on-premise. I also ate some appetizers at Float / pool...the humus and pita chips was the bomb! At $9 I was a bit nervous, but there was enough for 2-3 people and was very fresh...the pita chips were served warm and just grilled. Drink prices at the pool / Float during the day were what I expected...about $5-7 for a beer. Mixed drinks were more. Specialty drinks at ~$14. Bars - Multiple, awesome choices. As a hotel guest, call down to the concierge before 8 PM to get on the lists for both Float and 207, then show up to the bars before 10 PM and have your hand stamped for access to either all night without having to wait in line; and let me tell you, the lines are long! So utilize this comp. Float is a chic outdoor patio club/lounge on the 4th floor adjacent to the pool and they tend to play techno / house music at night. On the first floor off of the lobby is 207, its a dimly lit, deep woody vibe to it and they play hip-hop. You can get bottle service at either...entry bottle at ~$325. Float stays open and plays music until ~1:30 AM, so if your room faces the pool, just realize that its hard to fall alsleep early, but that said, if you want to go to bed early, then this probably isn't the place for you anyways. In general we spent more time at Float, as we liked the outdoor vibe a bit better, but they are both great and both are open during the day on the weekend for the sports enthusiast who needs a place to watch a few games. I also want to give a huge \"job well done\" to a few of the Float staff members who made the trip and visit worth while - Erica, Danielle, and Natalie! Thanks to the three of you for being so nice and providing some of the best pool / bar servicing that I've seen in all of my travels around the world. Hard Rock staff, you have some great employees! Location - simply perfect. The HRH is located at the cap end of the Gaslamp Quarter right in front of the convention center. Nobu is connected and there are multiple restaurants to try in the area. Venture out and sample a few things outside of the hotel...it will only make you appreciate even more how great the HRH can be with the right, open, and carefree attitude. $17 facility charge - yes there is a $17 resort charge, but it covers your internet / wireless connections and fitness center. Not a big deal, and honestly, I didn't mide it at all. The fitness center had great, new equipment and I even got in 2 great workouts during my stay. Didn't try the spa, but one of my friends did and had a great experience.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel with a great vibe\u201d", "Author": "SanDiegoTrvllvr", "ReviewID": "UR43656165", "Content": "I came to stay in the Gaslamp to enjoy downtown with my girlfriends the night before searching for a place to move in the San Diego area.

We tried both TV's and neither one of them worked. I kept hearing about people hitting there ankles on the bed corners and I'l be damned, I did it three times. What also pissed me off was that they charged me 17 bucks to use their facilities, which is horrible. I was there to relax and not work out. They shouldn't be charging you unless you use them. The one thing that really ticked me off was, we decided to go to the pool to relax and have a drink around 9:30 and were not allowed in because we didn't have club attire. I told him we were guests, but he said that doesn't matter. Either you change or you don't get in. So, what is the 17 dollar charge for again? I can't even get into the pool. I didn't even bother wih the downstairs bar. They would have denied me there too. I understand that San Diego/Hard Rock brings in a younger crowd, but to put the party goers first, before their guests who want to be leisure, is absolutely wrong. We had to walk down the street to have a drink and when we got back, I must of had about 5 peope fall on me because they were drunk. I am in my 30's, so I know how to have fun, but when I fork out hundreds of my hard earned dollars to stay somewhere, I should be able to go where I want within the hotel, without being told I am not dressed for the occasion.

Then with his security team in my room trying to fix TV and phone while I am on speakerphone with him, I tell him I am holding the $3 parking ticket. He tells me I am still wrong. Then says attendent must have made an error. Then I tell him it is an automated machine, check in on 15th out on 16th for $3. Then he changes story to we can't be reponsible for what other lots charge. Really? Then your staff should say they are $19. Valet didn't even want to let us unload if we weren't going valet. Told staff TV didn't work in morning still not fixed at night. We said we were checking out a day early, were told we would have to pay anyway. I said I was told 24 hour advance notce and we could cancel, they said early checkout pays additional night. Manager Luke angered me so much we left at 10:30 PM, got back to LA 1 AM.

Now I have to pay three nights for myself and two employees who stayed one fatigued night plus pay my employees car repairs. Fortunately my employee wasn't injured.

We get to our room, (by the way we reserved a double queen bed hard rock suit), We were so amzzed by the decoration it was very chic, a couch, a lounge chair, 2 flat screen tvs, a fully stocked mini bar with two bar chair facing a large mirror, a blacony with a mid view of the surrounding shops. I loved that we turned up the music on those flat screens as loud as we could without being reprimended for it like other hotels do. I didn't really get to see the pool and the cabanas. By the way we arrived on a Wednesday so it wasn't a big party ambience. The hotel was near walking distance from everything from coffee shops, bars, lounges, ice cream, restaurants, to cigar shops.

I made my reservations again, where the reservationist tried to butter me up my asking, \"Why are you staying at the Hard Rock? Business? Blah, blah?\u201d I reply, \"I'm celebrating my wife and I 7 year wedding anniversary\". Not 30 seconds later she asks me, \"How long have you been married?\u201d Now I know she is not paying attention. I let it go and later decide I would like to have champagne in the room when we get there. She transfers me to the Concierges desk, which is too busy to take my call. The reservationist gets back on the line and says,\u201d The Concierges desk will call you back and I will email you pictures of the difference between the Hard Rock Silver and Gold Suites\u201d. I reply, \u201cIf they are different from the photos on the website?\u201d. Of course, when I get the email they are the same exact photos from the website.

I reply, \u201cI guess so\u201d. She hangs up, I guess I\u2019m not buying champagne. Fri afternoon: I decide I\u2019ve had enough and call the desk to talk to a supervisor.

My husband attended a conference and I just went along because I had never been to California.

If you are staying at the hotel you get in for free and can skip the line. They also had a pool party on Sunday called Intervention, which is like the Vegas hotel's Rehab. The restaurants in the hotel were also great- Nobu and Mary Janes. The only thing that I thought was a little odd was that they immediately charge you $250 per night for \"incidentals\" on top of what your room rate was. No one at the front desk told us this and we used our debit card to pay, so the next day, I noticed $2700 was taken out of our account from Hard Rock. I called the front desk and they were very nice about it and explained that they immediately put a hold on the entire amount of your stay plus $250 per night for incidentals and then at the end of the stay, they actually only charge you for what you charged to your room. We were fine with it, but i couldn't help but think about people who used their debit card not knowing how much would be charged to it and then been totally screwed if Hard Rock was holding $2700 of their cash until the end of their trip when their room stay would only have cost them $1200.

But then, when I finally got my room cards at 6:30pm, I found some unsavory characters loitering in the hallways near my room and entered my room to find an unmade bed, large stains on the carpet, and a bathroom that smelled heavily of mold. Bad. Other than the layout, the condition of the room looks nothing like you see in the online photos. I ordered room service and it took almost TWO HOURS to arrive! All the while, my \"high speed\" internet connection kept timing out for some unknown reason (you pay a \"resort fee\" of $15 per day, which is supposed to include HSIA). Very frustrating since I had some legitimate work to do that evening. But it gets worse. Next morning, no hot or even warm water in the shower (at 6:45am...can't possibly be out of hot water yet). The maid had forgotten to leave soap, shampoo, etc. the prior day, so I had to go without. Came back from golf at 4:30pm, bed was still unmade, and no new supplies. I called down to the front desk and no one seemed to care, and no maid ever showed up. Then, around 7pm, another guest entered my room! Turns out, they had double booked it. I came back from dinner around 10:30pm (on a Tuesday night) only to hear blaring music from down below (and I was on the 6th floor, not the 2nd or 3rd). It went on until after 2am and when I looked out my window, I could still see a rather seedy crowd hanging around outside the hotel.

Also, this is one of the first times I've been in a hotel that does not have an in-room coffee maker or at least coffee in the lobby.

I think the worst was the Moonstone doormen and the rude rude ladies at the hostess stand in Nobu. The way in which paying guests are treated like second hand citizens or worse is unbelievable to me. There are bright spots in the hotel though. Some of the people in Mary Janes were incredibly nice, as well as most of the concierge personnel and the female and longer haired male members of the valet team (sorry I did not take names so this is all I can do to describe it). Bottom line is that a hotel like this MUST have star quality service. The price, the location, the setting, the tradename ALL demand it. Without good service, this hotel will fail miserably. No doubt. I was also taken back by the drab hallways and drab room walls. I suppose I thought I would see more things on the wall and a tighter design to the whole thing. It left me thinking that someone had taken over a Motel 6, remodeled the outside and added strange but nice carpet, nice beds, and a plasma and just expected people to be impressed. I was not. Another item I was absolutely shocked about was the spa. Say you are designing a lux hotel and it has a sister in Las Vegas with a great casino, spa, gym, pool and night club concert scene. You cannot put in a casino but to make it a destination you have to come up with some other primary draw. I would naturally build the best spa in town with a smokin pool and a concert venue that doubles as a nightclub on the weekends. But this hotel, presumably designed by smart people, has a small pool, a thimble sized spa, a closet sized gym, no concert hall, a bar scene typified by rude doormen and bartenders, no concert venue, no nightclub, a wannabe lounge that truly does not live up to anything its presumably hip owner has ever done before (imagine red bricks painted black with a red curtain here and there - ridiculous), a dining offering that is almost too upscale and that believes you and the rest of the world are not worth their Nobulicious time. And you are left with what? A nice old time diner, a cool front desk and nice beds? You cannot draw repeat customers with this, especially in these economic times. I travel the world regularly and stay in A LOT of hotels. This hotel was one of the most disappointing. However, I give it three stars because deep in my heart I know there is hope and there were some fun moments given the location. When I got home, I researched the hotel online using more than just Expedia. I read that it is owned by a motel operator, not a hotel operator, and one that does not have any other Hard Rock properties. That was no surprise. But I also found a recent article saying that the hotel had hired Matt Greene, the guy responsible for the tight design sync and customer service at the W, and most recently at the Hard Rock Las Vegas. If anyone gets what I am saying here, it will be him. For now though, my wallet and I will stay far away from Hard Rock San Diego until I see on these message boards that things have decisively changed.

We are in our early 30's and don't have kids so other people may have a different perspective. This hotel is trendy, definitely filled with some people who try too hard and just want to see and be seen, but its what makes the Hard Rock the Hard Rock and we found it to be entertaining. There are two bars at this property, both of which are very popular. We had drinks one night at the Moonstone Lounge. Fun place and good people watching. The line to get in the place on Sat. night was ridiculously long though, I so I would recommend going any night but Saturday unless you get there early (I do think you can get on a list if you are staying at the property). We stayed in a King Deluxe Suite on the 7th floor and the room was large and very spacious. Full living room with a bar, 2 flat screens, small balcony, etc. We never had problems with noise as other people indicated, but the bars are on the first and fourth floors and we faced away from the pool area so we didnt have a problem. A few cons to note. Housekeeping was a little spotty. One day they didn't leave us any hand towels, we ran out of body wash and shampoo on day 2 - both of which were never replaced during our entire stay, our full length mirror was never cleaned (I had accidentally gotten some hair product on it so I know), and the open bathroom situation is a bit strange (or should I say the room in which the toilet lives). There is a glass door that swings open but it is open at the top and the bottom and really offers no privacy. The biggest issue we had was with the mini-bar and random charges on our bill. The first day we had a receipt left on our dresser for a $4 water that we didn't drink. No big deal, they took it right off the bill. Our last night there we realized we had a $155 mini-bar charge on our account (no receipt left -- just noticed by looking up our account on the TV) and we hadn't touched the mini-bar the entire time we were there. We wanted to address it that night as we had an early flight the next day, but were told they needed to speak to the housekeeping manager first who wouldn't be in until the next morning. Checked out the next morning, charge had been taken off the bill. Check our AMEX bill the next day and they had charged us the $155 without authorization.

It's hard to separate the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego from the neighborhood it is in: Gaslamp. The hotel basically anchors the entrance to the Gaslamp District (comprised of hotels, restaurants, bars and shops too numerous to mention) and reflects the general atmosphere. On the weekends, HRH is a party place - period. It is loud, crowded and energentic. During the week, it is laidback and has a lot of contemporary charm. My wife and I used the weekends to let loose and the weekdays to move about the city for some sightseeing; it worked perfectly at the HRH. Being a registered guest at the hotel gets you on a pseudo-VIP list to the hotel's clubs on Friday/Saturday and to the Sunday Invervention pool party on Sunday afternoon. These events are very pretentious but fun (probably more so with a group of friends). For sightseeing, the location at the \"foot\" of the Gaslamp District is perfect. Not only is Petco Park right next door, 2 very user-friendly city MTS trolleys are within walking distance. Knowing what I know now, I could easily get to every major sightseeing destination in San Diego using the trolley system and the 2 major sightseeing transportation companies (one is a trolley/other is a double-decker bus) without a car. As for general hotel service/amenities, HRH follows the general trend I felt in the city itself: a) service is average and nobody really puts forth much extra effort and b) prices are on the expensive side. We did appreciate our housekeeping crew - their customer service was the best of any we received in San Diego (including all restaurants, bars, tours, etc...). The room itself was a bit odd though. We had a King Suite (with a great balcony). However, the layout of the room is not very practical and the fact that the bathroom had sort of an \"open air\" concept will be off-putting to some. Finally, valet parking in too high at $30 per day but seems to be competitive with the area. I would definitely stay at HRH again and would suggest it to friends. However, it is not for everyone. The place is, again, full of energy (i.e. noisy, young crowd) and not concerned about making you feel at home (on purpose, I would assume) as some hotels do.

The hotel wasn\u2019t even really that busy or crowded for a fourth of July weekend which is odd, but there was no reason for such rude behavior and it was very unexplainable. Then all of the staff kept giving us attitude. We would tip our waitress and she just grabbed the money and walked away (I have never seen someone so unappreciative for a tip and this happened more than once with her). We tried to walk back to the pool and then they wouldn\u2019t let us, without a wristband. (If we needed a wristband from the beginning, they should have given us one when they allowed us into the pool, and even after when they checked our names under the hotel. I was just so upset so I wanted to speak to a manager, and I went to ask the guy who walked away from me while I was still talking to him, what his name was. He told me his first name, Chris, and I asked for his last and he rudely responded \u201cwhy?\u201d I explained that I thought it was very rude for him to walk away while I was still talking\u2026he said \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about, you must be thinking of a different person.\u201d I told him that I wasn\u2019t the only one that witnessed it; my fianc\u00e9 was right next to me. He said, \u201coh well I thought you were done talking.\u201d (Now he knew we had the conversation where 30 seconds before he acted like I was mistaking him for some other rude staff member) So, I finally found the pool manager Oliver Kroll (the hotel manager said I had to go through the pool manager) and began telling him, how upset I was at how ALL of his staff were treating us. He apologized and offered us a bottle of champagne. I refused and told him that I didn\u2019t want anything; I just wanted him to talk to his staff so the rest of the day would be somewhat enjoyable. He still insisted on a round of drink, I still said that I didn\u2019t want anything more than him talking to his entire staff to change the rude attitudes. He sent a round of drinks anyway. 30 minutes later I laid down to suntan and closed my eyes, and a different rude staff member came by and tapped me and said \u201c you cant close your eyes.\u201d I asked why and he rudely answered \u201cyou can\u2019t close your eyes, it is a liability.\u201d (I have never heard of that, but I listened and got up). Then I started tanning with my glasses on, and he came up to me twice to see if my eyes were open which they were). We had finally had enough and called it an early day and went back to the room. We had hoped that the rude staff ended at the pool area, but that was not the case. We went to try and see fireworks at around 8:45 in the pool area and my fianc\u00e9 and I went in with shorts 5 minutes before my friend Derrick. When Derrick tried to walk to the pool, he was stopped by staff saying that he was not allowed to enter with shorts on. He said that his party just walked in with shorts, the guy began arguing with him telling him he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to pass and called his staff members for them to help with situation. Then we had enough, we went to the hotel manager Steven Goldberg and he apologized offering us dinner and drinks, we said we didn\u2019t want anything, we want to check out and want to be refunded. He told me to go on and do what I was going to do (we were going to dinner at a restaurant nearby) and he said he will talk to someone higher than him, and that he will call me and make sure I am taken care of. (He definitely did this so he would not have to deal with him face to face and he could just tell me over the phone) We called all the hotels we knew of and all of them were booked, we checked the directory for other hotels, and they were all booked for the night also. An hour later, I got a phone call from the manager Steven Goldberg and he said \u201cthere is nothing I can do, because the pool manager bought you guys drinks.\u201d I told him that I would like to pay for the drinks. He said \u201csorry, there is nothing I can do, Okay...\u201d then he hung up. I have never in my life been treated so poorly by so many people. When we went back to the hotel to sleep because we were told we couldn\u2019t enter the hotel the way we exited it was roped off. We walked around, and then we were stopped by more rude staff and they asked for our room key. We began to explain that our friend wasn\u2019t feeling well and left the restaurant early and took our key with him. The hotel staff member said very rudely, \u201cwell you better call him to come down here and give it to you. (Instead of trying to look for our names under the room, he wanted us to call our friend who we said wasn\u2019t feeling well to come down and give us a key.) (keep in mind that you cannot go to your floor in the elevator without a room key, so we had to go to the front desk anyway to get a key, but we cant even get to the front desk because they are stopping us from the front of the hotel). We were so upset and had enough. We called a few more hotels, and settled with a night for Saturday because that was all they had. We went downstairs to the hotel check out and ask for a checkout for the next day and we didn\u2019t want to be charged a cancellation fee. We were able to check out and checked into the Mission bay, Hilton. We were treated so well from the minute we arrived at their property. The San Diego Hard Rock Hotel is one of the worst experiences my friends and I have ever had and I definitely want to be reimbursed.

It was a romantic get away weekend for us. We spent two (and too) pricey nights at the hotel. I don't mind pricey if I get good service. What we experienced was anything but good service. We arrived at the front of the hotel and the lobby was very modern looking and clean. Staffing was good and we were helped right away. We were given our room keys and up we went. As soon as the elevator doors opened, it was as if we had stepped into another hotel. The hallway was filthy. There was trash and dirt all over the carpet in the hallway. Perhaps the dark color of the carpeting showed off the dirt, but a good vacuuming was in order. When we entered the room, it appeared to be clean, at least cleaner than the hallway. Very modern looking. It took about 2 minutes for my shin to find the wood base of the bed that sticks out farther than the mattress on all sides. It wasn't the last bruise I got from the bed that weekend! We did like the bathroom decor. We thought the shower with two shower heads was great! I went to pull out the desk chair to sit down and there was a stain in the middle of the seat that looked disgusting. A call was placed to the desk to get housekeeping up to clean it. Some time during the evening, the chair was cleaned. A message was left on the phone and tv that the cleaning had been done. Sunday morning, the hallways were still dirty, in fact more trash was added to the floor. We left for a day of sailing and returned at 4:30 in the afternoon to a dirty room. They had not even made the bed, let alone do any other cleaning or straightening of the room. Another call had to be made to get the room clean. I also asked to speak with the manager. I thought I would tell him about the dirty hallway. Of course, right after I ask for the manager, I hear a vacuum in the hallway! That was short lived, only about 2 minutes of hallway vacuuming, so it was still dirty. I think maybe someone else complained so they vacuumed in front of one or two doors (we were not one of the chosen few). The manager never called. We eventually went out for the evening. The room had been cleaned by the time we returned. Sunday, check out time. Still filthy hallway on our floor. Maybe we should have checked out the other floors? I am not a neat freak but the floor was so obviously dirty it really was a disappointment, especially for the cost of staying here. Normally I hear Hard Rock and think of good things. The San Diego Hard Rock was truly a disappointment. After checking out we did inform the manager of all the problems. He just said they were short staffed in housekeeping. I'm sorry but for what they charge to stay their, and to keep their reputation, the manager should get to cleaning if need be.

There is music all around the hotel which is cool. My major complaint about the Hard Rock is the bars and the cost. The bars are trying to be \"exclusive\" by limiting people and creating fake lines to get in. If you are a hotel guest you can get on the list, but have to be in the bars by 10pm. I saw at least 5 different arguments between doormen and want to be patrons because they were not being let in and had to wait in a line even though the bars were not crowded. One lady was an owner of one of the units and was not let into the pool. She got the manager and was finally let in. The drinks are really expensive at $10 a piece, which is way above other area bars. A friend of our tried to get in but the doorman said he could not go to the bar unless he was willing to do table service, which costs at least $300. We were in the bar and there was no table service going on at that time. The people in the bars are wantabe posers, and like to act like they have money. Although I thought it was good for people watching. The pool area is really small but the bar by the pool has alot of plush seating and has a good vibe, even though most people are trying to pose. Get down there early to get a seat, otherwise there will not be any. Parking is $30 which is high, and you have everything is expensive in the hotel. We saw at least 5 different bachelor/bachelorette parties going on at the hotel. This place would be good for that. Overall, the rooms and common areas are nice and modern and have a hip vibe.

The bed was very comfortable to lie in - but the corners of the base were keen to catch your shins and ankles and we ended up with very fashionable black and blue legs. The bathroom and loo were very spacious, but had glass doors, and although that can be quite seductive for the shower, a little more privacy for the toilet would have made it more comfortable.

I had stayed at the Hard Rock in Chicago and had a good experience with that property, so I though the San Diego property would be similar. At first blush, I liked the modern design of the hotel. But I can see how people would be turned off by the design. The valets and front desk clerks were great, but that's about the end of the positive comments. At night, getting back into the hotel was like getting into a prison. They set up a velvet rope at both entrances and make you display a key card to get into the lobby (even though you need a key card to get the elevators to work). I can see some safety logic to this, although the hotel is in a safe area. But the problem I had was the doorman refusing to accept my key card on multiple occasions. As others have noted, there is the Sweetwater Saloon on the ground floor, which might be popular at some time. During the weekend I was there, it was not busy. Regardless, the bouncers are incredibly rude to the hotel guests. We went to have a drink after dinner and were told that we couldn't go inside, even though we had put our names on the stupid guest list you have to use just to get a drink. The bar was less than half full and the bouncer let another group in while we were arguing. After I asked why the new group was allowed in, he told me that I had to leave the lobby or I would be arrested for trespassing. I'm not sure how I could be trespassing in a hotel that I had paid to stay in, but that was his threat. At the same time, I was soon surrounded by a bunch of bouncer-thugs who \"insisted\" that I leave the lobby. I went back to my room, but it seems like a weird way to treat your customers. The next night, we hung out on the bar by the pool. We met a few new people who had rented out a cabana and had purchased some bottles of vodka. Last call came and another bouncer stuck his nose in the cabana and told me I (and just me) had to leave. I showed him my key card and he accused me of having a fake card. He played with the card and talked on his walkie talkie. He eventually gave me my room key back, but then said that I \"had a lot of balls\" to be sitting in there. I don't think anyone should have to be insulted by the hotel's staff, especially in front of someone you just met. The whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth. What made it worse is that I've stayed at the Omni, which is basically across the street, and had a wonderful time. I would suggest anyone who is not wedded to the Hard Rock to stay at the Omni, unless you don't like being treated like a valued human being. Also, the rooms are fairly small and the tv remotes suck. There's no lock on either the toilet or the shower, and the both have frosted glass walls. Mary Janes' was pretty good for a diner.

A buzz in the lobby and all around and within the hotel that lets you know this is the epicenter of the Gaslamp quarter. You will smile when you walk in.

The Solamar is more refined with a somewhat more mature clientele. But it is also slightly less \"hip\". The \"W\" has a mediocre location for a short stay.

To get a feel for the place imagine a 4 Seasons hotel that has been commercialized to be a cheap and annoying version of something like Applebee's. It is like Britney Spears wrote the customer service training manual and hired the staff just after John Lennon or Jim Morrison signed off on the establishment. The staff are young, hip, good looking people who seem to be more preoccupied with looking cool than running a hotel. Our very first taste of things to come began as we got out at the valet entrance of the hotel. The valets were clearly not interested in listening to what the customer needed as much as they wanted to herd you through the line like cattle. Not completely out of the ordinary, but it became a problem later when we got to the room and find our luggage missing some items that we told the baggage handler's to bring up in the first place. The lobby is very loud which makes it difficult to hear. The receptionist asked what music we wanted four times, A minor issue considering the larger ones I will discuss, but even after asking four different times through the noise in the lobby our music in the room was still wrong. When we got upstairs we were impressed by the room's beautiful design, view, and quality furnishings. Our room featured a massive wall mounted LCD flat screen television complete with interactive menu and internet connectivity provided by a remote control keypad. The minute we turned the TV on, the music was gone for good not to return because we couldn't figure out how to get it back. It should be noted that if you are not the most technically inclined of people the rooms multimedia gadgets are difficult to manuver. There was no ethernet cable available in the room as advertised, so we were unable to access the internet from our computer, forcing us to use the internet via the tv. The keypad remote used to surf the internet did not work very well and we were forced to abandoned our cause. Unfortunately, our television would not work after that and maintenance had to be called to fix the problem. The repairman was perplexed with what to do to fix the issue, and we waited with him for about 45 minutes in a small room thinking of what we should do with ourselves in the meantime. Once he figured it out we thanked him and decided it would be best not to use the internet again which was sad because we paid something like $15.99 for the service we could no longer use. As a personal opinion perhaps not shared by others, it has always bothered me for a really nice pricey hotel to charge for internet service. It feels like I am being nickeled and dimed. About the time we were saying goodbye to our repairman we realized that some of our bags were missing. This is when I discovered that the bellman did not listen when I said please bring all of mine and my wife's bags to the room. I immediately went down to see where the breakdown was stopping at the valet desk to discuss the problem. The valet apologized and said he would correct the problem. I waited to see what the results would be for about 15 minutes. When nothing happened I asked what the problem was. The valet began asking me about the color and make of my vehicle. He apologized and said that his staff couldn't find the car. Realizing of course, he could do nothing for me and perhaps wanting to dodge the bullet, turned me over to the manager who behaved as if I was bothering him. He was impatient and somewhat inconsiderate of my problem. He never even once apologized for what had happened. Instead he opted to have me go down with him to search for the vehicle. Once we found the vehicle he told me to stay put, he ran away to go and search for the keys leaving me down in a garage I had no idea how to get out of. I found the exit and the valet floor boss no sooner than the manager arrived to tell me his people lost the keys and that the Hard Rock would gladly be picking up the parking fees. About ten minutes later the manager found the keys and had the vehicle into the queue because he thought I needed it. I just needed the bags. The car waited in the valet queue upstairs in the rain for approximately 20 minutes without my knowledge before I asked what was taking so long to get my bags and looking around the corner to see if they had brought the car up instead of bringing the bags. Sadly I was right and the bags were in the car still waiting in the valet line. Once I saw this I told the valet to bring the remainder of the bags up now. I went upstairs and my wife asked why I didn't bring the bags up myself and I alluded that we could trust the valet's at the hotel to do that. I was wrong and after a 20 minute conversation with my wife I found myself going back downstairs to find the bags sitting unattended in the lobby. I had to find someone to get the bags and follow me upstairs. After we had all of our things upstairs it was time to use the shower. The shower in the bathroom is very beautifully designed featuring a duel shower head system ( the first of which I had ever seen). There was a lever in the shower to control hot and cold and another valve to control water temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature gage didn't work and for the most part we took lukewarm showers. We already complained enough that to do so would have just resulted in us having to tell the staff about it and that had already proven to just be an addition to our inconveniences. The room service offers very simple fare at exorbetant prices with all types of little costs here and there to expand the company's profit margin. The room service orders took forever and once they arrived my wife's of course was incorrect. We had previously explained that my wife was allergic to tomatoes, and the salad she had ordered was covered in them. We called down to have them correct the order. After two phone calls explaining what we needed, the guy finally arrived 45 minutes later. (What we wanted was just a replacement salad without tomatoes). Instead, he arrived with another sandwich (my order) and a replacement salad for my wife. Of course it was completely wrong again, instead of a the dinner salad she ordered it was a smaller side salad. The meal was comped at our suggestion and left in an incorrect status. The next morning we awoke to find our paper missing. All other doors had a paper in front of them except ours. When we asked the a local cleaning lady what the deal was, she said it happens all the time and told us to simply steal someone else's from there room. Very rock and roll! I don't really care for the whole novelty angle of modern American dining and hotel stay that has become so prevalent in that part of the market these days. I didn't like the whole \"how may we rock your world\" slogan everyone used whenever you called when they seemed to care so little about what it was that you needed in the first place. It may have been if they actually seemed to care about rocking our world. The check out of the hotel was interesting to say the least. The receptionist asked me how my stay was and I blurted out \"terrible\" Her jaw dropped as if I had no right to answer with anything other than an affirmative \"terrific\". She demanded I give her my phone number and tell me what went wrong so that she could pass it on to her manager. When the manager finally got around to calling me the next day she left a confused message saying that one of her staff left her a message telling her to call us. She was clearly not read in on the list of problems I left the receptionist nor was she calling to address those issues. She was merely calling to find out what I wanted. We didn't return her call and resolved that the entire staff at the hotel was simply incompetent. We stayed with friends in the other rooms who were equally unimpressed with their stays at the hotel. Our overall rating was terribly unimpressive and I was really glad we lucked out with a discounted rate prior to checking in the hotel. If you simply want a nice hotel with a polite staff that will do what you need done the first time at a reasonable price avoid the Hard Rock like the plague. If you are just going for the novelty, then bring along some patience for the incompetent staff.", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cDon't Do It To Yourself! I'd Rather A Stay at the Super 8\u201d", "Author": "jetsetera", "ReviewID": "UR13342302", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego for a trade show we were attending for work. I had originally booked a different hotel but my husband said his coworkers were staying at the Hard Rock and since it's new we should give it a try. So I changed our reservation. Talk about regret! We live just north of San Diego, so we drove to the hotel in our car. We drove up to the valet and were greeted with a \"Valet is only for guests of the hotel or restaurants.\" My husband was immediately annoyed by the greeting and told the rude valet that we were in fact guests of the hotel and were valeting the car for our 3 day stay. $30/day, I would hope that they greeted guests with \"How do you do! Welcome to the Hard Rock!\" No one helped us with our bags so we brought our bags towards the front desk to check. The lobby was loud and full of try hards trying to look cool. We got up to our room and my husband went to a work event as soon we got to the room. I stayed in and ordered dinner from Mary Jane's. I wasn't expecting much since it's a glorified diner but I do have to say the meatloaf was decent. The best part about the hotel is the free internet (Don't use Firefox as your web browser, it's very spotty). The rooms are clean but I would hope so with a fairly brand new hotel. The room looks really good but you can tell the decor will look really horrible over time if not taken care of. The bathroom is decent but nothing to write home about. They fool you with 2 shower heads but it's no different than a regular shower. The water pressure is the same. Just a note: the bathroom has a sheer door so if you have to share a room with someone you're not that close to, it might be a bit awkward. We had a dinner at Nobu which I have to say was good but definitely not as smooth as my usual dining experiences at other Nobu locations or Matsuhisa in LA. Nicole our server was really nice. Everyone else seemed like they were hating life, especially the hostesses. Please don't stay on a weekend or during a convention week. There was a party at the Sweetwater Saloon and I could hear the lyrics of every song loud and clear from my 3rd story room. I was staying there because I was attending a convention and trying to sleep at 1:30am but how could I when all I could hear was Britney Spears saying \"Give me! Give me! Give me more!\" I wanted to slit my wrists it was so awful. I called down to the front desk and she said that the music turns off at 2am. Did they not think of sound proofing when they built this hotel? The following day my husband got a bad case of food poisoning (from dining at the Rock Bottom Brewery down the street). He skipped out on work because he was feeling so ill. I stepped out to the 7-11 to get him some Gatorade and other supplies before I went to a work dinner and cocktail party. When I got back to the hotel, the doormen didn't even want to let me in. After struggling with my grocery bags and purse, I finally found my key. I would think the bouncer would be able to tell that I, in my ratty sweats, messy ponytail and dirty sneakers was not going to the club. When I got back to the room, my husband was throwing up severely. He was trying to get a bucket of ice from room service. He had said many times that he was sick and that he needed ice. No one at mission control was smart enough to tell him that the wait for ice was going to be 1 hour and that he could have gone to an ice machine himself on the 5th floor. (Shouldn't there be a note in their little hotel binder about ice machines or something?). At around 2am, we both lay in bed listening to the drunken patrons of the hotel stream out onto the street. We said that we'll check out of the hotel first thing in the morning and not even shower or eat. We just wanted to get home, the hotel stay was so awful. Most hotels we stay at, we ask for late check outs. This hotel, we were dying to leave! In the morning I explained to \"mission control\" that my husband was sick and that I needed to have the car ready because I was going to take him to a doctor. The girl said sorry but the valet is busy, you'll have to come down and give him the ticket. So I went down to give them the ticket and waited in what I thought was a line up to check out. Somehow people just walked up in front of me. The check out person asked how my stay was and I told her terrible. When I got home I checked my bill and realized were were overcharged for valet. Check your bills thoroughly!! I called back later asking to speak to a manager. When you spend $300/night, I expect a bit of a better stay. At least if you stay at a Super 8, you know you're getting dog crap. But when I spend over $1500 at the hotel in 3 days, I would expect more than dog crap. I got a call a week later from a manager. Whomever I spoke to offered us to be upgraded in the future. That's funny because I would never stay there again, not if my life depended on it. Even if they enticed me with free stay or free food. Nothing in that place will ever get better. It's the kind of place that only cares about image and how cool they are. There are so many better places than the Hard Rock in San Diego. Don't stay here. Unless of course you're into horrible service and a cool scene full of try hards, wannabes and cokeheads.", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San DIego", "Title": "\u201cdid not enjoy our stay\u201d", "Author": "SD_VRSCDX", "ReviewID": "UR13079985", "Content": "My fiance and i liked the modern look of this new trendy hotel in san diego.

The staff is non responsive (except for a very nice couple that is soon to be married). We called for a bell boy and never saw one. We carried our stuff down and the concierge person was playing solitaire on the computer. The people at the hotel think its a plush vegas hotel and try to treat the guests like they are on sunset - in other words- they treat people like crap. We are never going back.

The staff couldn\u2019t accommodate a large party of professionals largely due to the fact the bars and restaurants in the hotel are managed by someone other than the Hard Rock! Why? Good question but we were not even allowed into the bars after spending $500 per night on a room there. Go figure. The security staff makes you feel like you\u2019re in a maximum security prison.

The hotel itself has two great nightclubs, one on the ground floor and one on the pool deck. Both were packed with beautiful people. It's obviously the place to be in San Diego right now, and if I wasn't a hotel guest, I probably wouldn't have been able to get in. In fact, I had some local buddies trying to get in with us, and they were turned away from both clubs. Overall, it's a great hotel with an awesome vibe!
