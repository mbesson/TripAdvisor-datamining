Breakfast OK - nothing special.Location is very close to Sants Metro Station - 15 minutes or so into central Barcelona. Had some difficulty one night getting back to hotel as taxi driver didn't know where it was but he dropped us off at the Metro station.Speaking to other guests, rooms are very variable in quality. Our room (515) was very small with double bed pushed into corner of room to create space to move around room - bathroom was almost as large! Window looking onto concrete wall. Wallpaper peeling off and carpets grubby. Other guests had larger rooms although those at front were woken by refuse collectors in middle of night.", "Date": "Oct 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR575784515", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Hallix"}, {"Content": "Clean, Friendly Service, Close to Metro and Trains. I've just returned home from a 7 nights stay at the City Park Hotel in Barcelona and absolutely loved it. The staff was very helpful and were always in a good mood. The lady at reception provided me with a few guides to Barcelona which proved to be very useful for my visit. The hotel is very clean and quiet, so I had no problem falling asleep after a day of sightseeing. The breakfast is fresh and there is so much variety that I think it caters for most tastes. The room was clean and the bed was firm, but very comfortable. The only thing about it that I didn't like was the smell of cigarette smoke on the fifth floor, where my room was. It seems to be ingrained in the curtains and carpets. The Hotel is situated just around the corner from the Sants metro station which will take you straight into the centre of town (Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas). It is also about 5 mins walk from the Sants Estacio train station, where you can get on a train to Sitges, or Madrid or to the neighbouring countries.

Beds were as hard as bullets and lighting was bad in the room but it was clean and was only a base as you were doing lots of sightseeing.Overall it is a good base and good if you don't mind catching the underground.

Several people on the same flight lost purses and handbags in the City. The guy on the reception desk named Gandi couldnt have done enough for me and helped me cancel my credit card instantly. The staff were very helpful, the room was nicely decorated and the bathroom was luxurious. There was just about everything provided in the bathroom that you could think of - bath gel, shampoo, toothbrushes and toothpaste, razor, tissues, combs, shoe shine kit .... I had read another review so knew there was no tea/coffee making facilities so I packed the travel kettle - no hastle. There is a supermarket just around the corner from the hotel.The free soft drink mini bar is just on day of arrival - 3 small bottles of pop. Handy to keep drinks cool though. The metro is approx 3 mins stroll from the hotel and the Sants station 5 mins stroll. The bus touristic can be found at the bus station right beside Sants so everything is really handy. 30 min train journey to Sitges - highly recommended and the train is free!

This hotel is situated in a quiet part of the city a mere few minutes walk from Sants Estacio metro which has good links to all the main points of interest.Our stay got off to a disappointing start in that my friend and I had booked a twin room prior to arriving and were told that a large group had arrived shortly before us and we had to stay either in separate single rooms or share a double (unless we wanted to trek to a hotel near the airport). This was annoying in that we'd organised all of this prior to our arrival. As friends on a city break together we wanted to be sociable and share a room but wanted to sleep in our own bed! The single rooms we were shown were incredibly small and felt very claustrophobic. We eventually stayed in a double room which was much roomier but didn't find the hotel reception staff particularly accommodating or friendly in this respect. All of the rooms are painted in a grey colour and this combined with mood lighting makes for a dark and somewhat sombre environment.The sheets on the bed were stained - yuck! These were changed when we asked. The breakfast was particularly disappointing ..... as it was Easter weekend the hotel was full but the hotel was just not prepared for this in respect to breakfast. On one morning we had to queue for about ten minutes just to get into the dining area .... there weren't many tables but many of them were for four people. They would definitely benefit from having more tables for two people. The scrambled egg was inedible .... tasted like some kind of powdered concoction, the bacon wasn't exactly pleasant either. The two waiting staff on each morning struggled to keep on top of things (they needed more staff on a bank holiday weekend) and tables were often not cleared or cleaned properly before you sat down.One of the roller blinds in our room was totally broken and could not be wound up .... this was really annoying as the room was so dark anyway. For \u62e2100 per night this lack of attention to detail was very disappointing.Many places and restaurants/shops were closed on bank holidays (especially in this hotel's vicinity) and the hotel had very limited room service (that didn't even start until 8 pm) and no snacks etc that could be purchased. It would have been helpful if we'd been made aware of this at the time of booking,It could be a good hotel but for all the reasons above it wasn't in my opinion. It was a pretty disappointing use of my hard earned cash!

It is very clean and modern looking and the rooms are a good size and our room overlooked a small park next to the hotel which is situated in a fairly quiet area of the City. It does live upto its 4 star standard.The hotel very obviously caterers for business conferences and this added to the quality of the hotel.In terms of the price we paid for 3 nights accomodation it was incredibly cheap (although it was January) but i doubt we'd have got better value anywhere else.The staff are the most friendly and welcoming people that i have ever met in any hotel that i have stayed in before, they couldnt do enough to help us.We had the buffet breakfast each day and it was the ideal way to set us up for a days sightseeing.In terms of location it is just 50 metres to the nearest underground station (which is by far the best way to get around the city and it is cheap as well). As part of this underground station is 'Sants Estatio' which is one of Barcelonas main train stations and it cost just 2euro50 to get to the airport.City Park is just 15mins walk from the Nou Camp football stadium.Taxis to the main city centre (Plaza Catalunya and La Rambla)from the hotel cost in the region of 5-10 euros depending if you get stuck in traffic or not, but take the underground if you can.Plaza Espanya was also about a 15minute walk.If i was being extremely fussy i did expect coffee/tea making facilities in the room although the minibar compensated for this with some complimentary non-alcoholic drinks on arrival.Not that you would have a night-in, in Barcelona but there wasnt much going on at the hotel at night, but like most people we just used the hotel as a place to sleep between enjoying such a magnificant city.I would not hesitate in staying at the City Park hotel again if i were to re-visit Barcelona, even if it was just to meet the staff again", "Date": "Feb 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR361247682", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "IvanCampo"}, {"Content": "nice place we stayed for 3 nightswe had a very good breakfast and plenty of choice, the staff were freindly, the rooms were very nice, free soft drinks in the mini bar and a very nice welcome pack in the bathroom. its in a good position for all areas of barcelonawould stay again, its a good place to watch the world and there dogs.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR600152306", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mello72"}, {"Content": "Great hotel and goodish area.
