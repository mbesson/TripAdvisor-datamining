{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent simple accommodation Me and a friend booked this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor. Being 2 females, our aim was to find a decent hotel in a safe area in central Frankfurt within walking distance of the Christmas Markets. And that is exactly what we got.The hotel is small. OK, the rooms are simply furnished - think Travelodge/Premier Inn. OK, the bathroom is compact. But we did not feel as though we were ontop of each other. More than enough room for 2 girls to spread their clothes out and their shopping! We wanted a base where we could sleep and shower. And anyway who goes on holiday to spend all their time in their hotel room!?!?Room, bathroom and public areas are very clean - that is what is important to us. And the beds, both me and my friend found them very comfortable. For someone who suffers from back problems and finds it difficult to sleep in strange beds, I suprisingly got a couple of good nights sleep!The bonus was that we could check in at 11am. The reception staff are friendly and professional and nothing is too much trouble for them.The first morning we had breakfast at a cafe down the road which worked out a lot cheaper. The second morning being a Sunday when nothing was open we breakfasted in the hotel.Breakfast cost 13 euros for a buffet which as a business and leisure traveller to cities I found average. A good choice of cereals, cheeses, meats, yoghurts, tomatoes, cucumber, breads and hot items of scrambled eggs, frikendel, bacon and nuremburg sausages. Juices, selection of teas and filter coffee all of which you helped yourself to. There was even a toaster there to make your own toast. We filled ourselves up ready for our late afternoon flight back.One negative point was that there was no kettle in the room. But I believe that this is true of most German hotels and it not being standard practice to put kettles in rooms. So do take your own travel kettle.Location wise, could not fault it. A couple of minutes walk from S-bahn station which takes you straight to and from airport. Also the U-bahn and trams to take you around the city. A couple of minutes walk from shopping of Zeil. And a further 5 minutes or so to the Christmas Markets. Felt safe walking back after a few gluweins in the evening!All in all, we found this hotel a little gem of a place and certainly would not hesitate to use it again on any further visits to Frankfurt.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR554124255", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Annie_Rach"}, {"Content": "Simple, comfortable, good location The hotel was difficult to find and parking is impossible. Thankfully, they allowed us to leave our car right outside the front door all night! Comfortable, clean room, but disappointed breakfast was not included. They wanted 13 euros for bfast. But, there is a fantastic bakery right across the street, so we just went there each morning and saved at least $15. Very close to S-Bahn station (Konstablerwache) and the best shopping Frankfurt has to offer, one train stop away at Hauptwache. Very close to Romer, and the altstadt (old city). Front desk girls were very, very nice and helpful with directions, but the next night a grumpy old man was working front desk and rude. We would stay there again for location alone. (now that we know how to find it) Definitely eat dinner at the Twelve Apostles restaurant around the corner for the best German food you've ever had.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR418371648", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "frankfurtarmybrat"}, {"Content": "Simple but pleasant I stayed in this hotel for only one night. It was a simple hotel, but the reception was very friendly and efficient. The location was quite central. The room again, was simple but sufficient. They told me that they would get me an iron and ironboard in the morning, I was a bit sceptical, but they delivered it at 07:00!!! Not one minute late or earlier! The breakfast was nothing special, but standard for German standards. The price was extortionately expensive for what it was, but apparently it was due to an big event in town, so all hotels took advantage of increased demand, so I don't thing this hotel was alone in ripping people off :)", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154359231", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Bahadir"}, {"Content": "NOT for a business traveler I stayed at the Frankfurt La Scala for 4 nights in august 2008 during a business trip on the advice of other colleagues.This hotel is NOT appropriate for business travelers at all! For budget travelers, fine but nothing else.the lobby is currently under construction so check in is in the breakfast room. Check in was okay. My room was clean and seemed like it would be fine; however, the wireless internet did not work, the wired internet cord was broken, and the TV had no volume. i complained about the TV volume and they did nothing about it.there is no ac so you need to leave the windows open. again this is fine, but the road can be noisy so you should know what to expect.the breakfast was minimal. I met someone for breakfast at the NH and it was SO much better. Check out was OK but they do charge extra for breakfast without telling you- be prepared.I would never stay here again but if you are a budget leisure traveler, it can probably work.", "Date": "Aug 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR823114799", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "ladybugx87"}, {"Content": "Excellent value for money Overall: This hotel is a modest 3 star hotel that provides excellent value for your money. Facilities: This hotel has one elevator in its small lobby and a restaurant area partly below ground at at ground level. It only has for rooms per floor. It has a small circular driveway sufficient for parking and offloading luggage. They are not fussy about leaving your car there for a while while you get settled. Parking: There is a 24 hour covered garage about 100 meters away from the hotel. Rates are very reasonable. From 7PM to 7AM it was only 3 Euros. We put the car in at 7PM and took the car out at 11AM and paid about 8 Euros. The exact address is Parkhaus, Konrad-Adnauer Str 15. Do not worry (as I did), you can see the parking sign from the hotel.Reception/Checkin: We met 3 staff at reception and all were young and very pleasant. No issues with check-in.Room: The rooms are basic. A reasonably firm bed (we had 3 beds due to one child), a desk and chair, a closet, a TV. Be warned that there is no air conditioning, but there is a fan and windows do open. Frankfurt can be hot so you will have to decide on the importance of no A/C. Bathroom is small, but clean. A built in squeeze bottle for soap and shampoo is attached to the wall. Non-smoking rooms are available which we took. We had a room facing away from the street which was quiet (not much of a view but it did not matter). We found it very quiet (very tolerable outside street noise).Location: The nice part of this hotel is that about two short blocks from the shopping street Zeil. It is a large pedestrian friendly shopping centre on both sides where shoppers can walk in the middle. What I found interesting is that in North America, the area around the mall would be buzzing with cars, but there was hardly any because the subway stops there. Note that hours are shorter than in North America.Value: Breakfast was only 12 Euros per person and room rates and parking were reasonable. Breakfast was full hot and cold with bread, cheese, cold meats, smoked salmon, cereal, eggs, sausage, bacon, juices. Great deal. Travel around Europe hotels and restaurants and you can appreciate a reasonably priced meal.", "Date": "Jun 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR536228466", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "synToronto"}, {"Content": "Good value for price Clean basic but rather small rooms.

Rooms are airy and clean, all amenities, spotless bathroom and friendly front desk.Steps from Zeil pedestrian shopping mall, Karstadt and Kaufhof department stores, near restaurants, easy walk to old city, river and churches.

Average room, third floor view to street with huge window; could hear people talking in other rooms but not disturbing to sleep (only 4 rooms per floor). Accomodation in general looks quite new, including furniture. Small tv with limited channels, but I didn't come to Frankfurt to watch tv. Didn't use breakfast facilities.

So many things that went wrong. From the outside I was optimistic, it's situated in a very conveniant area for shopping and the area looked safe and clean. Starting from check in, it went from bad to worse to unbelievable. The girl that was checking us in was friendly but incompetent. She kept saying that she was new when she couldn't answer any of our questions (example-They advertise special ergonomic pillows that are available per request. A cardboard sign right on the counter prominently displays this and when asked about it she said she had no idea what we were talking about) The room booked was a double with a shared bed and I mentioned it while she was doing the check in and sure enough she gave us a room with seperate twin beds. We were able to switch though without too much hassle. The stairway and hallways smell oddly of chorine as if you were in an indoor swimming pool. The room itself wasn't terrible. Rather roomy but the furniture was chipped and not meticulously clean. It was also very cold in the room so we turned on the radiator before we left for dinner and when we came back it was still cold. We called to ask about it and apparently there is a trick to turning it on, but no instructions left for the unusual device (which when turned on properly, still did little to warm the room. The bathroom was tiny and cramped and dirty. The towels smelled moldy and the shower had visible mildew staining. I was bathing when I noticed a strong mildew odor and saw the dirty curtain. I finished my bath as a standing shower trying to touch as little as possible. That night I started feeling really sick and ended up contracting some allergy or flu like symptoms. I was sick for the remainder of my trip (luckily we didn't stay another night)The hallway acoustics are such that any noise echos up all levels loudly as if the noise was right outside your door even if the people are on a different floor. There was a family shouting and arguing and making their children cry from late at night and early in the morning(not sure where but it sounded as if they were right outside our door). We told the front desk and they merely shrugged and said that's too bad. In the morning my partner was showering and the heavy metal soap dish fell out of the wall because the caulking was so decayed and it hit and injured his foot. Again that was met with an apathetic that's too badterrible, uncomfortable, and unsafe.", "Date": "Feb 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR375143235", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "meeps"}, {"Content": "ottimo   showReview(23291101, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 5, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR390288916", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "giannadidi"}, {"Content": "Buena relaci\u8d38n calidad precio   showReview(11299006, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 7, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR238423262", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "CARME32"}, {"Content": "\u93c4\u5e9b\u5020\u9287\u5fcb\u4eb6\u9288\u5c7b\u4e9c\u9287\ue048\u5134\u705e\u5b28\u4ef9\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19157631, 'full');", "Date": "May 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR684279536", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d280583-r22757653-Best_Western_Hotel_Scala-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "280583", "Price": "$223"}}
