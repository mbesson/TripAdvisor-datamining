{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel in the Height of the Night recently stayed there and will make this my favourite Hotel in Frankfurt; this si for a few positive reasons i like to list here:- proper and nicely decorated rooms, with very modern furniture and appliances.- bar on the 22nd floor is quite nice and has live music dirung the week, not bad as ther is no other place in Frankfurt where you can look down like here at night. - great view, which i like 24h. - good working AirCon, which is not always the case- nowadays, rack rate is 215 Euros, i think this is reasonable for what i get in other places.- a good location to start the day (Starbucks below on the left)- close to my clientsShortcomings are- Entry into the tower is abit funny with the security- yes, reception is small, but folks are friendly and nowadays better trained. - it lacks a bit personality, its purely functional building, no deco no concierge, etc", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR315926000", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FOL-1003"}, {"Content": "Interesting alternative, with flaws Excellent location for business travellers without a fear of heights. View from my room on floor 25 was great and room itself was of a good standard and quite spacious. Breakfast was reasonable if you don't mind being surrounded by american bankers talking shop. Reception is on 22nd floor and I was unable to get to it for 30 mins when I arrived to check in because of a fire alarm which was not great. A crowd was 'detained' in the entrance hall waiting for this ! The ground floor bar (unrelated) is a hot spot on tuesday nights. OK choice - better than the Hilton for sure.", "Date": "Jun 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR353157345", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Gastronauta"}, {"Content": "Pleasant room, unqualified staff Due to a large trade fair being held in Frankfurt, all my preferred hotels were either fully booked or charging excessive prices. The Innside Residence is a five-star serviced apartment housed in the skyscraper building of the European central bank where it occupies a few floors. I booked their standard room for 109 Euros per night without breakfast. The hotel is located in the banking area, there's not much there in terms of restaurants or shops but the Zeil, Frankfurt's shopping mile, is only a short walk away. The reception is located in the 22nd floor, you first pass a welcome counter which is manned 24 hours per day and the staff their buzzes you through glass turnstiles or opens a gate for you. The lift system is quite spectacular, each floor has a hi-tec round lift room and one of the 6 or 8 elevators propels you up to your floor. All doors and lifts require your keycard or the pressing of some buttons to open, all very hi-tec but security-wise, a complete overkill for a hotel and probably by far not enough for a bank. The reception is quite tiny and cramped and was manned by a young and very dour receptionist. No welcome or greeting, I was just asked my name and then ordered to fill-out the check-in form and hand over my credit card. I had arrived around noon and my room wasn't ready yet which is absolutely fine but when I asked when I could reckon with getting it, her answer was check-in is at 3. Very inflexible but I guess not unreasonable. But still, every good receptionist in a 5 star hotel will go out of their way to contact housekeeping and see if they can get a room ready a bit quicker.I then took care of some business and returned at 3.30. A different receptionist was manning the desk this time, also very young and apparently very inexperienced. She was being very rude to other guest and between checking in people, had to answer the phone calls of people wanting to make a reservation and cash in tabs from the hotel bar at the same time. The reception of this hotel is completely understaffed and not up to the job. I had to wait 30 minutes until they found my suitcase and got me up to my room. The bellhop who accompanied me there was very friendly and apologetic though.The standard room was pleasantly decorated, quite modern and in very good order with a nice queen bed, a sitting area with two chairs and a TV and a large wooden counter. The room also had a small kitchenette with a hot plate, coffee maker, refrigerator and microwave oven and was stocked with a pan, some plates, cutlery and glasses. The kitchen also has a small counter with two stools where two people could share a quick breakfast. The shower and toilet were located in two separate rooms and both very clean and modern. Instead of a kitchenette, I really would have preferred the room to have a safe. This is probably the only 5-star hotel I've been to in Europe which didn't have one and I had no desire at all to go down to the reception again to deposit my valuables. One nice feature of the room was that the windows could be opened despite being in the 27th floor, there's another pane outside the window but you can still let in some fresh air. WLAN is available in all rooms but they charge 18 Euros a day for a pretty lame 1MB connection. For a hotel specialized in long-term stays, it's absolutely unacceptable not to offer free and faster internet access. Somebody staying there a month would have to pay over $700 just for their internet connection, it's absurd. Breakfast would have been an also expensive 19 Euro, I passed, in Germany, 19 Euro will buy you a very decent meal in many restaurants.The next morning I got some work done and left the room at about 11 am. When I returned after 5 pm, my room wasn't made up yet. Shortly afterwards, somebody from house keeping knocked and asked if I wanted service. My comment that it was quite late was met with a big grin (haha, less work) and the guy immediately sped away and didn't even offer to change towels or quickly empty the trash cans.When I checked out at 10:30 the reception was crammed with other guests, check-out was equally unorganized as at check-in and my request to call for a cab was only met after having to ask three times.Despite the missing safe and the much overpriced internet connection, the rooms of this hotel are pleasant, modern and well-equipped and some offer spectacular views of the surrounding skyscrapers and are worthy of the hotel's five-star rating. The staff and service doesn't at all live up to the billing and I definitely won't be staying here again.", "Date": "Dec 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR110329022", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "CamelClass"}, {"Content": "Nice location and views, overpriced My family tried staying here to use the kitchenette to reduce eating out costs. Our small room consisted of a king size bed, 1 desk area, 1 table and 2 chairs in front of a tv. The kitchenette had an electric burner, sink, and a microwave tucked in a cabinet. The room itself was very modern. The sink bowl above the counter, wood floors, halogen lights, and a translucent shower that everyone in the room could watch you take a shower in.The rooms were very quiet, I didn't hear other hotel guests slamming doors or making much noise.In this role is was cramped but very acceptable.The view was wonderful, the cool glass elevators gave a nice view going up as well. This hotel is a quick walk to the main center of frankfurt.No one to help with bags at the ground level, though someone helped bring them up from the 22nd floor to the 29th after we checked in.A very small menu (from a good italian place in town) was limited for room service, otherwise they have a thai and pizza place they recommend for delivery. Didn't matter to us as we would bring food in to make/eat.My reservation price for weekday nights was different from what they charged. They were unhelpful in settling this, they claimed they called the reservation website and they agreed with the higher price. However when I contacted the website, they agreed there was a difference and they are refunding the difference.From 109 Weekend/235 Weekday prices on their smallest room, there are better deals in town (Turm Hotel) and better service.

Views are stunning although I would guess some rooms only see the equally high skyscrapers across the way.As a hotel though it struggles to get three stars. Security is amazingly tight and after a while a real chore. The hotel bizarrely is situated above the European Central Bank. Reception staff professional but detached.Room was a good size and a mix between the very modern and a travelodge or motel. Nice big bath but no fixed shower. Comfy bed facing the view. The kitchenette is pointless unless you are one of the long stayers. The bar, whilst spectacular, is small and the hotels resident long term guests just block reserve all the best tables by the windows. These corporate bankers make other visitors fell as though they are intruding on a private party.Overall the hotel is just like Frankfurt - impressive at first sight but soulless", "Date": "Feb 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR425877843", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "zonda"}, {"Content": "Very modern, hip hotel in the heart of the city This hotel is very cool  hip, in that it is extremely modern (especially the security  elevator procedures!). We were annoyed that our room was not ready upon arrival after a long flight from NY, but were happily surprised when we did get it. Each room has living room, kitchenette, and Japanese sliding wood/glass doors to the bedroom. High powered modern shower and bath robes. Because this hotel is on the 22-27 floors of an office building the windows do not open. But there are electronic blinds on the outside of the windows that you can adjust. Beautiful view of downtown Frankfurt.My only complaint (as a New Yorker), is that their AC did not work very well. Even at full blast the room was a bit warm for our liking. But then again it was the hottest time of the year and most Europeans are not as addicted to AC as Americans. I would definitely recommend this hotel for people staying in the heart of Frankfurt...easy walking distance to most places.", "Date": "Sep 9, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR958629736", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "junkbondgirl"}, {"Content": "Sehr sch\u679anes Hotel mit atemberaubender Aussicht   showReview(11436100, 'full');", "Date": "May 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR779496233", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d231134-r15007528-Inn_Side_Residence_Eurotheum-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "231134", "Price": "$454"}}
