The refrigerator was so loud I unplugged it and the heater so loud I turned that off. But I could get rid of the guy next door who had the TV on when I was working and that sound came under the door clear enough to almost follow the plot. And then there was the sanitation. An unclean toilet and a large piece of plastic in the ice cream I ordered for dinner. The Olive Oil ice cream otherwise was very good, although the service was kind of slow for being so uncrowded. Oh, I forgot the worst thing--they left the alarm clock set for 5:30 without telling me! And the stupid thing doesn't have a night mode so I had to have my iPhone by my bedside to see what time it was when I woke up in the middle of my time-shifted night.

In my opinion, that hotel has gone down hill over the last 2 years so I wanted to try another property that was still reasonably close by. Only 5 minutes farther up I-5 North is the Del Mar Marriott. It is so much nicer than the one in the La Jolla. It has been completely updated, and the rooms are very clean & spacious. The concierge lounge is outstanding with a very wide variety of hot & cold foods for both breakfast & dinner. I did not use the pool area, but it looked really nice. I don't like that the parking garage isn't attached to the hotel because you have to walk completely around the building so I deducted a star. It is also shared by an office building so there are many reserved spaces that hotel guests can't use. The parking is cheaper than many hotels at only $10/night. There was discount applied to my bill so that may only apply to higher Marriott status levels. The hotel is in a very quiet business park area so I had no problem with noise either outside of the hotel (traffic/people) or inside either. This also means that there are few services within walking distance, but there are lots of sidewalks if you want to walk or run. It is a straight shot down Carmel Valley Road (about 5-10 minutes depending on traffic and the lights) to get to the beach and the cute little Del Mar restaurant area. I highly recommend eating at Jakes Del Mar but you have to make a reservation. They have the best seafood but it's definitely pricey. In short, if you want a Marriott property near La Jolla/Del Mar, this is by far the nicest one. It's great for business but would also be a good base for a San Diego vacation. If you need to be closer to downtown, the Marriott Gaslamp District is the best of any Marriott property in all of San Diego, however it is also usually the most expensive. If you're looking to use points for vacation, definitely choose the Gaslamp. It is ultra modern, hip and in a spectacular location.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice property.\u201d", "Author": "Greg M", "ReviewID": "UR125297762", "Content": "The property is very clean and the rooms appear new.

The property isn't really far from things to do, but you pretty much have to drive if you want a good selection. Downtown Del Mar and the ocean is about a 12-15 minute drive.

Despite the fact we were there for a soccer tournament and there were other teams staying there, it did not seem overly loud or busy, even for a holiday weekend. One drawback is everything costs extra. Self-parking $15 or valet parking $20. Internet $12. Plus all the taxes etc really increased the price of the room. Parking garage was decent but does have a height limit. Pool looked very nice but we didn't have time to use it. My room was the farthest from the elevator on an upper floor, so maybe that is why it was so quiet...no one wandering back & forth past my room!

Safes do not take up too much space, folks. 2) But they did have a minibar in the room - and it was turned off and completely empty. Either my persona did not effuse Marriott with confidence in my solvency, or minibars are \"out\" at Marriott as permanent room features. Here is a suggestion: take out the non-functioning minibar and replace it with....wait.... you guessed it!

Sure, it's only a short drive to the beach but still....but when you Priceline you get what you get and they will not re-nigg on it and let you cancel. We got our room for $75 per night. Safe area, clean area, nice hotel, very clean, rooms nice. Did not eat at the restaurant in the hotel. Hotel seemed very dead. Weekends the business park area was DEAD, kind of a strange feeling but nice at the same time, NO PEOPLE! We used the pool twice, heated but very windy always at the pool area as it's up on top on the side of the building. Hot tub very nice, POWERFUL jets felt great on my back. We were traveling with our 2 1/2 year old daughter, I think we were the only ones there with a kid. Lounge area outside is nice, lots of cushy seating, gas pit fireplaces for at night. Pool area nice. Gym looked really nice, did not use it. Free bottled water in the gym, FYI. I had read several reviews that said there were no mini refrigerators in the rooms so we did not expect one at all. The dresser the TV sat on was odd, one side had 3 drawers and one side looked like faux 3 drawers but only one handle, we thought that side was broken. So we left it. Then on the 2nd day I was observing it again and saw hinges on it, it was a door! There was a fridge behind it, tricky. (see pics). So YES there are refrigerators in room. Maid service very good. Free newspapers during the weekday. Free in room coffee and tea. Hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner and lotion (all Bath & Body Works \"Energyze\"). The theme of this hotel is \"Energize\". Oranges, reds and yellows and golds are the dominant colors in the decorating scheme, I'm not sure I liked it..... Biggest pet peeve: parking is $18-24 a day or something like that. We parked on the side of the hotel (the cul-d-sac road). We never had an issue finding a spot but you could if the hotel gets busy. I noticed the maids park there during the day. My other issue is that they charge $14 per day for wi-fi, get out! There is free internet in the lobby and you can print stuff for free. We printed out our Legoland coupons and our boarding passes from the business center downstairs. Overall, this Marriott stood up to Marriott's exceptional quality standards in my eyes, I just didn't care for the location. Not very many restaurants nearby. About a mile down the road is a Von's grocery store anchored shopping center with a bagel place, an italian restaurant, an indian restaurant, a mexican restaurant, an ace hardware, starbucks and other small businesses you would find in a shopping center. We ate at the bagel place, but not the others. There is also a Pat and Oscar's restaurant. We do not have these where we live so we went in & checked the menu, didn't care for pizza and pasta so we did not eat there. Right next to the hotel is a Howard Johnson's hotel and a gas station. Next to the Howard Johnson's is a Taco Bell and also right next to the hotel is a Mexican restaurant. It did not get the best reviews so we chose not to eat there. We actually took a drive to Encinitas to eat at Chili's. :) Yes, it was 10 miles to find specific restaurants! Oh well. You get to get out and drive around and see the different areas right?

My other issue was that the rooms could have used some, I guess I'll call it maintenance type cleaning. The carpet had dirty spots, & the throw on the end of the one bed that had one had strange stains. From what we found the \"Business Center\" was a few time-limited computers in the lobby that had issues accessing work related sites. I like the Del Mar area that this hotel is in because it's not the \"rest\" of Del Mar near the fairgrounds. What I wasn't necessarily fond of is getting in & out of the hotel due to the orientation of the hotel on the street. But everything in this business park area has the same issue. We ended up at this hotel because we bid on a 3 1/2 star level on Priceline rather than our usual 3 star in this area. The 3 star is the Double Tree that, while not as \"pretty\" and not featuring what seems to be an outstanding restaurant, doesn't charge for parking. You'd think these places being almost directly across the street from each other parking would be either paid or not at both. Odd.

I didn't use the card because I didn't care if I got clean linens, but I expected the bed to be made.

Here is where the nightmare started (no exaggeration, in fact it is a bit toned-down). On the night of the 24th, we decided to rent a humidifier from the hotel, since the first night in the room was dry (a typical California night). At 12-midnight, the fire-alarm goes off. With the 11 months old baby crying in that terrible noise, we do our best to try to put off the alarm for about 5 min. A lady calls in (who cannot speak much English, and has no clue about the humidifier), and tells us that she is going to send someone over. A young man walks in the room, climbs on top of the bed with his SHOES ON, and struggles with the alarm for couple of minutes, then rips the alarm out the wall saying, \"This is broken. I hope there's no fire from your room tonight, hehe.\" I, then realized that the fans in the room was not working, and the humidifier has fogged the room, and caused the alarm to \"break.\" We were very unsatisfied and decided to tell the front desk about what had happened. The next morning, I walk up to the desk, and ask a young lady to pass on the message to the manager about the humidifier incident, and I was stunned by her response & attack. Young lady: Well, OBVIOUSLY, we cannot foresee the alarm to break. Why didn't you report the fan problem in the first place? Me: (Trying to figure out why she hasn't apologized ONCE, and why she is blaming the GUEST for not catching what is broken in the room) Uhh... could you please just pass on the message to your manager? We are very upset, and this is the first time in our lives that we made a complaint to a hotel (we have stayed at numerous hotels around the world, and this is by FAR the worst service). This is not what we've payed for. Young lady: I am glad to replace you to another room, if that's what you want. IF YOU HADN'T RENTED A HUMIDIFIER, THIS WOULD NEVER HAD HAPPENED. Me: (Trying to manage my anger from the rude tone, and how she tried to justify them not being responsible for the broken alarm REPEATEDLY) We will come back and discuss this, since my family needs some sleep. PLEASE pass on this message. Since we could not go back to the hotel until around 9PM that night, I called the hotel, and they told me that we were getting an upgrade to room #1022, and access to the Concierge Room. We were not please with the young lady, but we thought that the hotel was doing there best at that point. Early next morning, I tried to check the internet on the first floor, and the guy at the front was using one of the computers (out of two, and the other one was broken). It was not very pleasant having to wait for the WORKER to just sit there, browse through the internet. I did not complain about this, since we did not want to \"rat\" on this guy, but there was more to come. We go into the Concierge Room to get some breakfast on the last morning. The lady there, told us that our name was not on the list. I had to explain everything to the lady, and she understood. We were again, not very satisfied by this simple miscommunication within the hotel. When checking out of the hotel, the young guy at the front, had his hands in the pocket throughout our conversation. We have (again) never received this kind of service in our lives.

This is the second time we have stayed here. This time, it was much busier than the last time. There were a lot of group events going on so the bar and restaurant were constantly crowded. That is a sign of the success of the hotel, of course. The restaurant, Arterra, seems to be extremely popular with more than just hotel guests. As far as the rooms are concerned, everything was fine - comfortable bed, rooms cleaned on time, nice amenities in the bathroom. One thing I really like about this hotel is the location. Although it seems unexciting - it is basically in the middle of a business park so is not a good choice if you don't have a car - it is only about a 15-20 minute drive to downtown San Diego and 10-15 minutes' drive to Del Mar, La Jolla and Solana Beach so you have the option to go in either direction for dinner, beach or entertainment.

It is, after all, mainly for business travelers. Our reservation was wrong upon check-in. They only had us there for 1 night instead of 3.

Pretty average. The breakfast the next morning was just eggs, toast, mangled bagels, and sausage, fresh fruit. Not awful, just very average and not worth the exta money we spent that the business didn't cover. The appetizers and dessert in the evening were the same. No big deal.

At first, I thought it unremarkable, from the outside to the pool. But after the first night, and with all the travelling we did, I ended up really appreciating how close it was to everything, how helpful and friendly the staff was, and how comfortable the beds were. The hotel is in a safe and pretty business and residential area. I felt very safe here. This building district was clean, nicely landscaped, and well lit. The residential neighborhoods were above average to high end. Beautiful flowers and landscaping abounded. We saw vegetation we wished we could grow in our backyard. I saw arbors, pergolas, climbing vines, it was a gardener's dream, and really added to the feel of the place. Casually elegant, lushly landscaped, a true coastal town. We were very close to a Plaza that had lots of stores and lots of casual dining options. We drove towards the Del Mar beach (maybe 5 mins at most) and took 13th street to Bullys for our first night. We had read from a guidebook that it was family friendly. It was . . . in a way. It was definitely a bar, and despite anti-smoke laws, it smelled of smoke and there were plenty of drinkers there. I wasn't comfortable here. It cost us $80 and without a doubt, the sirloin steak I had was delicious, but the atmosphere wasn't family friendly, the server was distant, and the sides were average to below average. My husband and I had opted for the steak and shrimp plate, and were each given 3 shrimp. The salad was a classic iceberg and the rice pilaf wasn't very good. There was a child menu the guidebook had promised, but for $5.95 the choices were chicken nuggets, hamburgers, and mac and cheese. We expected to pay high but we also expected to have good to excellent food. My daughter, who adores mac and cheese, couldn't eat more than one bite here. She's not a picky eater either. We ate brunch at IHOP at the Plaza after that, the only IHOP I had ever seen with mercedes, bentleys, and bmws parked in front. I am sure there were other family friendly restaurants nearby, but we were hard put to find them. There was a Red Robin in the plaza, and when we checked out the nearby La Jolla Marriott (it was very close to a shopping mall and restaurants there), we ate at Sammy's Fire Grilled Pizza. That was great. They had yummy salads, pizzas, and a good children'ts menu. Prices were $10 and up. Most restaurants we found were higher end electic sea food, fine dining establishments. Which is great, but not for a family vacation. We ended up eating also at the attractions we went to: SeaWorld, Legoland, and the Zoo. SeaWorld actually had a decent selection. The apple fries at Legoland were also pretty good. The Zoo was more expensive than SeaWorld, which surprised me. This Marriott has the new Marriott bedding, feather pillows, and feather comforter. It was extremely comfortable. We had two double beds, and they were the equivalent of a full size bed. I think it would be comfortable for two adults and two children, though just barely. There was a pool that from outside my window looked unremarkable, but we tried it out after a long day, and found the heated outdoor pool to have a comfortable temperature and to be very relaxing. It had two lap lanes roped off to one side. There was also a jacuzzi that was a nice respite as well. You can also rent a mini fridge, though there are no microwaves. We couldn't have driven more than 15-30 minutes to any of the attractions we wanted to see. We were going to stay downtown at the Marriott Marina towards the end of our stay for 2 nights for a local vibe, but just came back here. We were familiar with our way around, and found it to be more reasonable (parking elsewhere is $18 to $22, but here it was $11). It wasn't as crowded as downtown and I ended up being very pleased with it. There are fees for virtually everything (local calls, internet, etc.) but even with all of that, for a full service Marriott, this hotel or the La Jolla, would have been hands down much cheaper than downtown overall. I had wanted to tour Balboa Park, and peruse downtime, but there simply wasn't time for it. The people here are very friendly. If your trip to San Diego is more attractions oriented, I don't think you would be disappointed with this hotel. It is a great place to sleep, not noisy at all, and close to everything.", "Date": "April 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morris Plains, NJ", "Title": "\u201cAwesome stay.\u201d", "Author": "kimperc", "ReviewID": "UR4830913", "Content": "Just returned (April 1st weeekend) from a stay at the San Diego Marriott Del Mar!

We got a great rate of $139, which included parking and breakfast. Breakfast for four and parking would have cost us an additional $60 per day - so this was a great rate. The rooms were clean, and large enough. The bathroom was very large. The location of this hotel was great - right off the 5, which runs north/south in California. We were traveling to LegoLand and San Diego Wild Park Zoo, so this was the perfect location. It is also very close to Torry Pines Reserve beach, and the Del Mar beach - both were wonderful. The breakfast buffet was wonderful - it included made to order omlets, french toast, cereal, sausage, fresh fruit and juice. I highly recommend their breakfast. Room service menu was limited, but what items they did have were very good. We ate dinner via room service twice. As all room service, it was pricey, but worth it for us after a long day out. There are many restaurants in the area - Red Robin, italian, and mexican. They are about 2 miles away in several shopping centers. There is also a super market, organic market and two Starbucks within a few miles. For rainy days (yes it rained when we were there) there is also a movie theater close by. For dinner, the restuarant in the hotel, The Arterra, serves wonderful meals and even sushi. This is one of the top rated restaurants in San Diego. We declined the dinner there as a way to save some cash, and the fact that we had small children. I would have loved to go if it were just myself and my husband. There is an outdoor pool - nothing to brag about. Sort of on the small side, and even though it was suppose to be heated, felt very cold. We tried it out on the first day, and then decided it wasn't worth the change of clothes. All in all, I'd recommend the Marriott. It was a nice place to come home to after a busy day out with the kids, and their breakfast was wonderful. Also, everyone we met there, from the bell boy to our waitress at breakfast, was always happy to see us and made us feel like their only customers.
