It certainly is a good location for exploring downtown, the historic district and Condessa. The hotel is an unusual wedge shape on a roundabout and looks quite austere from outside and the entrance area, lobby and Goudi restaurant are all also quite grand. However, we did find the rooms to be a tad on the dated side. We had booked a room with a kingsize bed on Expedia but when we checked in they did not have a king available, so after being shown a twin room, we elected to take a double room and were then moved the following day into a room with a kingsize bed. The rooms were clean and adequate, although could have benefitted from some refurbing. The bathrooms were quite small with tiny bathtubs. We enjoyed drinks in the bar area and were brought out little nibbles which we really appreciated. We did not dine in the hotel as we choose to enjoy sampling some of the restaurants around the city. There are plenty of Starbucks around the hotel, so we usually took a short walk in the morning and took in the flavour of the city vibe and a cappuccino. We did the open-top tour bus rides to see the city, although you could walk along Reforma to the a number of the historical monuments. We also walked to Condessa one day, and took the tour bus to the Pyramids from right outside the hotel. We found all the staff at the hotel to be pleasant and friendly, and although it was a pleasure to be in a part of Mexico where you do not constantly hear English, the staff had a good understanding of English (which helped us!) Our cab from the airport cost $194 pesos (a bargain we thought), and although at first wary of taking cabs we took one back from Coyocan one afternoon during rush-hour, which cost $70 on the meter, so we realized that cab fares were quite reasonable. After this we decided to try taking a cab again, but this time the driver took us a long-way round for a 5 min ride and then tried to charge us $100. This happened a second time, where we asked the driver to switch his meter on and halfway back he claimed it had stopped working (more likely switched it off), as it was reading $24 and then he tried to charge us $100. So be wary of these banditos! We took the hotel taxi back to the airport for $150.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo", "Title": "\u201cPrime location at low e-booked rates\u201d", "Author": "TokyoFrenchFlyer", "ReviewID": "UR121368483", "Content": "Clean, gracious and efficient.

You will not be able to get a radio-taxi from here, unless you call it yourself. There are a few English- and Japanese-speaking drivers attached to the hotel, so-called \"taxi turistica.\" These are pleasant and friendly but don't offer best rates unless you insist beforehand. NB, in Mexico City it is NOT advisable to hail taxis on the street. The buffet breakfast is ample but for much less you can order coffee, coffee with milk, or tea and delicious sweet rolls, if that is all you require. There is a Sanborns mini-department store across Reforma and several adjacent convenience stores for beer, snacks, and other needs. Don't forget to have your shoes shined on the street for a dollar. Be generous and pay with a 20-peso note. You could never achieve this brilliant shine yourself. Don't try it at home.

The four years gone by were kind to the hotel. Not much has changed - either way: The Hotel Imperial is a beautiful hotel, that still has kept its charm from the turn of the century - the 19th that is. The luxury has somewhat faded from the days it housed presidents and diplomats. The hotel's location on Reforma boulevard at the Cristobal Colon traffic circle puts it in the middle between the historic district/Alameda and Zona Rosa/Chapultepec Park. Metro stations for line 1 and 2 and 3 are within 10 minutes walking distance. I made the walk fromn the hotel all the way to the Zocalo via Bellas Artes and to Chapultepec Park along the monuments, statues, and various art pieces to be done in 30 minutes each -or less, and quite pleasant. A friendly staff is helpful and most speak English. The lobby, bar, restaurant and cafe areas are pleasant and appointed with taste. You have entered a 3 to 4 star hotel (on a 1-5 scale). I had booked a king room (for one person). I had requested a room on an upper floor to escape traffic noise (especially on the Morelos Blvd side), which was obliged. To receive a functioning A/C and refrigerator presented a challenge and 1.5 hour waiting. The room's furniture resembled more 2 star accommodations. The room was clean, the furniture functional. A hard mattress (the aztecs didn't sleep on anything softer either!), dresser, desk, round table, a couple of chairs and a few pictures. Ample closet space with a built-in safe (get lock from receptionist). You will find hotel branded accoutrements everywhere. The stationary, toiletries - all had the Imperial Hotel's logo. The A/C produced about 65-70 degrees on high fan speed. It was October and 75-80 degrees outside - so I am not complaining about lack of A/C. I just don't know if it would work when it's hotter. The bathroom: stone counter and tiles everywhere, plenty of towels, 2 bottles of water every day, plenty of toiletries, a shower enclosure over the tub. Though shall not walk on that carpet with light colored socks - enough said! I go to Mexico City to enjoy art, history and cutlure, not to spend too much time in my hotel room. But - it would have been nice to have more than one or two English speaking channels on the TV (get remote control from receptionist), but then - you have not lived until you watched the Simpson in Mexish. A reliable wake up call got me going at 4:00 am to catch the return flight and the bell man had a taxi cab waiting for the airport ride (180 pesos = $15). Numerous restaurants and shops are in the immediate vicinity. Sanborn's accross the street is a small department store with a \"quite ok\" restaurant - open until 1 am. A convenience store is next door to the hotel, (they have your cold beer, cappucino, snacks), bakeries, cantinas, more restaurants, Banks/ATMs, etc are very close. I did eat once in the hotel's Cafe (afternoon buffet, 165 pesos) the food was \"pretty good\" - but repeated itself day after day as I observed. Waiters were somewhat inattentive. The lobby/restaurant bar seems stocked well - and has the best ice cubes I ever had. Check it out and you will see what I mean. In summary: I paid $50 per night (incl. tax and fees, through a lonely travel website), and I had safe and satisfactory accommodations in an excellent location. I had done extensive research on this and many other hotel websites and could not find a better value in the center of Mexico City. Should I return with my spouse/fiancee/secretary and want to \"impress\", I would go to the next level and select the Camino Real at Chapultepec Park for twice the money. But I am glad that I did not pick the lower priced options off Reforma, in Zona Rosa or in the historic districts. I walked by some of those and I was glad that I did not save the $10 or $20. The Imperial surprises nicely in some areas, disappoints in others. The Hotel Imperial was a satisfactory choice that gave me my monies worth and then some. With a little investment and consistency by hotel management, this could be a prime selection for the financially conscious, yet amenity oriented traveller.", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLosing its luster\u201d", "Author": "jjcpeter", "ReviewID": "UR118677086", "Content": "Decent location, though busy and quite noisy.

Overall, a charming place, highly recommended for those who need a nice place to stay with helpful staff and a comfortable room, and can do without all the hightech amenities like free wifi that big hotel chains offer. NB - The price was 50 euros per night which is certainly a lot less than the 135 dollars currently indicated on tripadvisor..", "Date": "January 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Acapulco, Gro.", "Title": "\u201cClassic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4975906", "Content": "Classic hotel inaugurated by Porfirio Diaz in 1904.

Dirty Carpets, chandeliers and rust around the bathroom fixtures and not replacing the bottled water we consumed were a few of these examples. Additionally, the ample jacuzzi tub looked like it had not been cleaned, therefore, we avoided use. The bedroom curtains facing the street did not close, this compounded the street and traffic noise. The bedding was sparse for the cool weather and they certainly could have used some comforters or at least additional blankets. The mattresses were hard & we had to ask for additional pillows. The staff was inexperienced and incognitant of directions or surrounding area restaurants aside from the extremely overpriced below average hotel restaurant. We did have a great (hotel arranged) tour guide to the pyramids, ballet folklorica and the floating gardens which I would highly recommend. With a little bit of TLC this place could be a great hotel, it just need to be tweeked!", "Date": "January 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arizona", "Title": "\u201cDelight\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2197428", "Content": "This quietly elegant hotel is a former presidential home and later, embassy.
