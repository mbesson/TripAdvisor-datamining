This is important to note in case you book on online sites that still refer to it as \"Blue Hills\" as your cab driver may not know where to take you given that the hotel is off a narrow street in the Sultan Ahmet district and now only identifiable by it's new name on the exterior (next to the red chinese restaurant). The hotel's location is great - a short walk to the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia, Topkapi Palace, Armenian Cistern, Bazaar etc.. and the trams are a stone's throw away. It's also a 15-20min walk to the ferry terminals and the Galatasaray (?) bridge. The hotel rooms are a good size but I was kept on the ground floor and could hear everything at reception, including the annoying ambience music that plays non-stop during the day (and the track list is cyclical). Showers were not that hot, rooms were clean (relatively), the breakfast menu was repetitive and nothing extraordinary.

In short: The good: * Location - even if you don't stay at this hotel, stay in the Sultanahmet area from which you can walk to most major sites and tram to other. It's the central tourist hub which is convenient to stay in * They let you use their laptop in the hotel lobby to surf the net. Unfortunately, you have to navigate a foreign keyboard which take a little getting used to. Bring a wi-fi enabled phone instead if you can. * Rooms are clean although there was a musty odor when we checked in. Rooms are as pictured on TripAdvisor. Noise was not an issue when we stayed there. * Roof-top buffet breakfast was fine and the views were great. Not sure what they do in the winter time. The bad: * Depending on which staff member you spoke to, you may get biased advice that will help them earn commissions on airport transfers, tours, and other services. * Definitely not a 4 star hotel as advertised on TripAdvisor Suggestions: * Try booking through the hotel website for a better deal * Try to negotiate for a free hotel pick up BEFORE you book. Otherwise, they offer to give you one for EUR 30 which is double of what you can generally find around town. Don't try finding this place on your own when landing in Istanbul cuz the streets can be confusing at first. * The Lady Diana hotel which is a block away seemed like a much better hotel and some of our friends got a room there at a much lower rate (maybe cuz they were part of a large tour group).

Our trip to Istanbul was great and we felt quite at home at the hotel. We contacted Brittany Wade of the Hotel's Management directly and got a decent rate for a double bed. The hotel also arranged for transport from Sabiha Airport (though ofcourse at a cost but they do offer free transport from Ataturk Airport). Our room which was located on the 3rd floor was nice with a comfortable bed, a sofa and a flat screen TV. The room seemed a bit small in the beginning but then we kind of got used to it. The bathroom was rather small though the shower area was a decent size. There was a peculiar smell in the bathroom when we checked in and we realized that the dustbin was quite loaded with rather unpleasant things left behind by the previous occupants and overlooked by the cleaner. However, it was cleaned the next day. The sheets on the bed were clean but the pillow cover and bedcover did have a few stains. To add to that, a pigeon flew into our room (our mistake actually since we left a window open) and created quite a riot. But no complaints since the sheets were promptly replaced the next day. The breakfast is on the roof which has a lovely view of the Blue Mosque on one side and the sea the other. The breakfast is standard Turkish food with some fruits, lots of jams, cheese, butter, boiled eggs, fresh bread etc etc. But we are a bit fussy when it comes to breakfast and after 2 days, we wanted to eat something different but then mornings is not the best time to venture out looking for an ideal breakfast so we settled for whatever was offered. Mind you the food was definitely nice; it was just the monotony of having the same grub every morning. The staff is very polite and guide quite well. Language was a bit of a problem with the lady assisting in the morning breakfast and the cleaner but the reception staff was fluent in English so no issues there. One very good offering by the Hotel is a free wifi in the room, which I though was great since most hotels would charge for a similar service. And the internet connection was fast. There is also a laptop available at the reception if one is not carrying their own computer.

My 3 year old son took a great liking to him. Chihan (evening duty) and Varol were extremely helpful in planning our outings and showed us on the map where to go. They even booked events on behalf of the customers, which was great. We had breakfast on the roof when it was sunny (4 days out of 6) which was fantastic. Breakfast was decent, and they even allowed us to have breakfast after the 10.30am deadline. For long trips and for our journey back to the airport, we used Backpackers (got the details from http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/tourop/bakpak/index.html). They are pretty much the same price as a taxi, but much better service and you get to go in comfort in a large mercedes van. If you need to go for long journeys, I advise to use them. They are fantastic and were always prompt. I will hopefully try to write a review of Istanbul on this site, especially for family with a small child. Just one word of advice, if you want to do your shopping, dont buy from the Grand Bazaar, unless you are one heck of a barterer. Best place is the Spice Bazaar or even local supermarkets. So to summarise, lovely hotel, perfect location with great staff. For a family or couple, it is ideal.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cFantastic value for money and great service\u201d", "Author": "BackpackerNewZealand", "ReviewID": "UR52726817", "Content": "Great value for money - good breakfast that is included, free internet (wireless and a computer downstairs) and spacious rooms.

We stayed for a week and really enjoyed it. The hotel is very central to the old part of Istanbul - Blue Mosque etc and close to public transport - the tram is less than a five minute walk from the hotel and it is very easy to catch this (with a change from the metro) from the airport. There are also two supermarkets close by (about 3 mins walk - turn left out of the hotel and left again) which are handy when you are staying for a while. There is also a great kebab place called Ortaklar on the intersection of the same road which is delicious and inexpensive For elderly / disabled people, be aware that the bathtub is high and a bit awkward to climb into (the shower is over the bath) - so ask about this when booking.

The actual street that the hotel is located on is pretty dead but you can easily walk to the nearby restaurants and bars. The service is also excellent. The staff quickly learned our names and helped us with restaurant recommendations and other information. Notably, on one evening my husband had to go to the hospital because he had a fever and the staff person make several calls and hailed a taxi to take us to the medical clinic. We were very impressed by their responsiveness. The roof terrace has a beautiful view of the city. Unfortunately, it was under construction while we were there and breakfast was served downstairs instead. However, once the terrace is up and running again, I think it would be an ideal place to have breakfast. The only reason why I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because it advertises itself as a non-smoking hotel. However, there were ashtrays in every room and there was definitely some smoking going on in other rooms near us, which bothered us. I would definitely stay here again but would love it if the hotel were entirely non-smoking.", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cterrific Choice\u201d", "Author": "LisainChiTown", "ReviewID": "UR46207614", "Content": "Staff was very friendly and helpful with every request I had.

They called repeatedly for our luggage, called us while we were out when the luggage finally arrived, and in the interim, personally walked us to the store to get some toiletries. just before our trip to Bodrum, they held our luggage for a few days with no questions asked.
