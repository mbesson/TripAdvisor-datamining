The hotel is located in the Gothic quarter on Avenida Catedral, within easy walking distance of Las Ramblas and Catalunya square. The cathedral square is busy during the day and peaceful at night, so you should be guaranteed a good night\u2019s sleep in the comfortable beds, without much background noise. We chose a standard double room which had cathedral view. I would recommend getting one of these rooms as you can look out from the balcony and watch the world go by, not that you\u2019d want to, as there\u2019s so much to do in Barcelona. If you like any form of art then do not miss the Gaudi buildings. I knew so little about his work and was left stunned by his designs. Breakfast in the hotel was excellent, with a choice of hot and cold continental breakfasts to suit most tastes, along with fresh fruit, freshly squeezed oranges and lots of coffee/tea. Apart from breakfast and a daily cup of tea/cake, we didn\u2019t eat in the hotel, this was because there are so many good places to eat in Barcelona, however the hotel menu looked pretty good. The staff at the hotel were professional, helpful and friendly and I\u2019m not just talking about the reception staff, everyone we met was helpful and happily suffered from my poor grasp of the language. The test of any good hotel has to be whether one would go there again. Well the answer from this contributor is a definite YES. Some additional advice. If you are arriving by Plane then I recommend that you pick up the Aerobus from the airport. The bus drops you off at Cataluna square which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The bus costs about 6 Euros per person. Also if you want to eat some good Spanish food, stay clear of Las Ramblas, it really is for tourists.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in excellent location\u201d", "Author": "NYHel", "ReviewID": "UR125586645", "Content": "Just stayed for one night and will definately stay again next time we are in Barcelona.

The Jaume I Metro station is a couple of blocks away and there is a handy selection of supermarkets and bars nearby. The hotel is housed in an old building but looks very modern inside. It is very clean and efficiently run; the reception staff are helpful, if a little impersonal. Our room was a reasonable size with a decent bathroom, a fridge and a view of the very busy main road below. The breakfasts were rather good for a city centre non-resort hotel. There was plenty of choice, both hot and cold. There is a small bar on the ground floor but it tends to shut rather early. One night we fancied watching the Barcelona v Real Madrid match (the hottest ticket in town!) on the tv in the bar, only to be ushered out at 9.50 because they were closing. Whatever happened to service? It's true to say that the hotel is a little noisy, considering the busy main road and the Metro rumbling directly underneath, but you soon get used to it and it's not a problem. In general, the Colonial is a very reasonable place to spend a few days exploring one of Europe's finest cities. I'd like to finish with a few words of warning. Firstly be extremely wary of anyone approaching you in the street or elsewhere on any pretext: They're almost certainly after your wallet. I know this kind of attitude does little to foster trust between people, but we had at least two narrow escapes; a favourite method is to get you to prove your identity - don't fall for it! Secondly, many guide books and internet contributors will tell you that it's dead easy reaching Barcelona City centre from the airport by train and Metro. All I can say is these people obviously travel without an ounce of luggage or other encumbrances! By the time you've dragged a modest-sized suitcase up and down Metro steps and along the interminable walkway at Passeig de Gracia, you'll be wishing you'd spent the 30 Euros or so required for a simple taxi ride.", "Date": "February 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "essex", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel in great location for exploring Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Rich2768", "ReviewID": "UR123829363", "Content": "Overall we were very pleased with our stay at the Barcelona Hotel Colonial.

The hotel service/overall performance will be given a really poor grade considering these circumstances: 1.) Internet Internet at the hotel was non existing during our stay, even if advertised before. We talked to the front desk 3-4 times regarding the issue, and were finally (after 1 1/2 hours) told that there was a problem and that a technican would be sent out, but the day after our stay. Recommendation was made to go to Starbucks to use internet. 2.) Vibrations, Sleepness factor As some people already wrote: The vibrations from the subway passing each 10 minutes on our 2nd floor room, made our night terrible. I cannot see how anyone can sleep in a vibrating bed. Maybe some people see it as charming, but for us it made our night at this 4 star property more or less sleepless. 3.) Breakfast We were staying at a total of 8 hotels, ranging of 2-4 stars during our 12 day trip. This was the only breakfast which we consideed totally uneatible . Old cheese, ham which was so old the edges were dry, banana-flies in the fruit. Really disgusting, and totally unacceptable. 4.) Phone At our room we had no signal/service. I turned to the reception after the internet problem, to ask if it was possible to change rooms because of this and previous inconviences, we were told -No and were advised it had to do with the coverage of the operator. I had the option to choose between Movistar, Yoigo and Vodafone. All worked fine in the lobby but none worked at the room, making it impossible for people to reach us, or to call. To summarize: The property is in a really good location, still all the above issues are far from what you expect from a 4 star property. To make sure that the guests have a good stay and solve inconviences, is the number one priority on all 4-5 star properties I visited (i am both a frequent traveller in business/leisure).

We agreed to this room for six days, but we have told her that although the location is FANTASTIC, it may not be worth the rate for many due to the internet charges (and can only be used in lobby), the noise of the metro (didn't affect my group at all), the internal rooms are dark but have a horrible six inch wide balcony that looks onto a white wall (we only slept there but other half of our group had excellent balconies looking onto the street--noise didn't affect them and they were on floor 2), front desk isn't overly friendly or rude for that matter--just matter of fact (although just speak English because they could care less if you try to speak Spanish to them--perhaps it's because they want you to speak Catalan instead?), and we paid $2 euro a day for safe (ridiculous to charge since it's in your room!). Our room, once settled, was very comfortable. We were first put into a twin bed room along with our daughter and friend getting the same style room (we complained and were moved to the first floor with one bed which is what had been requested more than six months ago). Then we realized it was a wheelchair accessible room which meant no vanity in bathroom, shower water ran everywhere on the floor since there wasn't a barrier, the closet was tiny, no bench but a luggage rack, and just lack of storage space. AND the balcony overlooked towels and sheets being hung out to dry and a white wall. We requested to be moved, but since the twin bed room was already given up, we had to wait until the next morning to ask again. We were accomodated the next morning with one bed and plenty of storage. We still had an awful balcony, but this hotel doesn't have many rooms, so many of the twins have the better balconies. The bar closed at 10:30 pm (wow!), and the breakfast came with our room. There was plenty of selection (along with CAVA!) with meats, cereals, breads, yogurts (I had wished for wheat breads or different croissants other than just plain)--a little tiresome after five mornings of it, but it came with the cost of room, so we ate there! The big pros are that it is so close to metro and HoHo bus stop, an excellent but small grocery store minutes away (water is .50 euros a bottle!), a club across the street for quick drink, a cafe minutes away on same side as hotel that, as long as you at least buy a drink (or anything), you can get WIFI, and the beach is within ten minute walk. Even the mall is within walking distance (half a mile). The public bus that took us to Juan Miro and to Sagrada Familia also has super close bus stops.

The rooms are clean, and designed. If hotels were meant only to be chosen from a website, this would have been perfect. Unfortunately, hotels are also to stay in, and specifically to sleep it. This one just doesn't make it. Throughout our stay service was bad, everything extra-charged, and the overall experience was just a real dent in our otherwise great vacation. A few examples below, but first, the main caveat: NOISE. There are two different noise issues. First, the entire hotel shakes every 5 minutes with every train passing below. This is a matter of bad flooring - you will not feel this in the lobby, but spend more than 5 minutes in any room and you will. When we asked for a room we can actually sleep in we were told that this pertains to the entire hotel. Second, the rooms are not noise-proof and the face a super-crowded street, which is very noisy 20 hours a day. When asking for a different room we were told that they can put us in an \"internal room\", which turned out to mean that the windows face the inside of a chimney. It was quite, but very dark. Also rooms in the first two floors are in the same audio space as the lobby, so any conversation going on in the lobby will trouble you in your room. Apart for that we were amazed that the only internet options in this place were a 1-euro-per minute slow connection available only in the lobby. On two of our days there the cleaning lady skipped our room. Any basic amenities such as ice or luggage room came at a price, and with an attitude.

Location is great because you can walk around the gothic quarter and are very close to the Cathedral Santa Maria del Mar, which is absolutely gorgeous, especially at night. Lots of restaurants nearby and you can also easily walk down to the waterfront. I was at this hotel for New Year\u2019s Eve, so I walked down to see fireworks by the water and it was great. Away from the immediate craziness of Las Ramblas for New Year\u2019s, this location was perfect for me. Also, relatively close to a metro stop, as are most hotels in Barcelona. I always felt safe, but was mindful not to walk down deserted streets or little alleys, since I was a woman traveling alone. The only downside to the hotel was that their internet wasn\u2019t working. Because I was organizing some elements of my trip on the fly, it was very annoying to have to go to Starbucks and internet cafes to go online. I don\u2019t have any idea how often they have trouble with it, but it never worked while I was staying there. Otherwise, the staff was great, hotel was clear, room and bed was very comfortable. The shower did spray onto the floor, but as long as you put a towel down you are fine. The spa-like raining shower head didn\u2019t work as well as I would have liked, but that may have been because the water pressure wasn\u2019t strong enough to do it justice.

And I believe I would choose the same hotel for my next visit to Barcelona Cons. There were 2 problems with the hotel which distorted our stay. 1. While booking our hotel, it said that the rooms were soundproof, which is completely not true. The hotel is located on a very noisy street and it was really hard to sleep as the noise did not stop throughout the night. And of course the windows were not sound proof. The walls are very thin too and it is clearly heard when neighbours are taking shower or smth else. 2. We stayed in the hotel for 7 nights and the key to our room discharged twice which is really disturbing when you get back tired late at night and on the 5th floor find out that the key won't open the door.

Cool bathroom fixtures, rainshower etc... and bedroom furnished nicely. Location is very central to the beach, the underground trains and the Gotic Quarter \u2013 really enjoyed that. The housekeeping staff seemed friendly whenever we asked for towels or other small items. What they could do better: Service is poor. Hotel is disorganized, less than friendly staff at the front desk. Most inquiries are met with \u201cno, not possible\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. When passing by the front desk on a number of occasions, we overhead the desk agents in some type of altercation with guests on the phone. Air conditioning in the rooms cannot be controlled by the customer \u2013 it was preset and we found it quite cold at times so opened the windows to make it more comfortable. Pillows quite hard and are made out of those tiny pieces of styrofoam like a bean bag. What is unacceptable and why we would not recommend this hotel: Misleading advertising. Hotel website says \u201cfree internet\u201d, \u201cking beds\u201d and there are websites selling the property they say, \u201ccomplimentary breakfast\u201d. Upon arrival, we were told internet is 12 Euros per 24 hours, that there are no king beds. The most unsettling part and a pretty negative last impression for us was upon check out when we discovered the so-called complimentary breakfast was not free. As the front desk agent explained \u201ccomplimentary\u201d in Spanish translates to, \u201ccomplimentarios\u201d which means \u201cnot included, extra\u201d. Despite our attempts to explain that the English website where we booked led us to believe it was included, we were forced to pay \u2013 when we said we would not pay as it was false advertising, the agent immediately said he would call the police. Perhaps this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened. We asked him to have the hotel at least fix the wording on the internet to remove any ambiguity so as not to have this problem in the future. The agent said WE should contact the website company (which makes no sense for the consumer to manage a company\u2019s site and its partner\u2019s sites). 129 Euros later, we left the hotel feeling somewhat taken advantage of. Please check in advance as to whether your breakfast is actually included. Ironically, this breakfast was the least impressive of all the hotel breakfasts we experienced on this trip and the only one we had to pay for since the others were all included. Certainly not worth 10 Euro per person. There are many places to eat within one or two blocks had we known. Other minor issues with the hotel: We needed use of an iron. It took two days to get one since the hotel has one iron for the entire room inventory and apparently it was locked up in another guest\u2019s room and the hotel could not get it back (?). I mention this as a good example of how the hotel doesn\u2019t really make an effort to help guests. Room safes are available but one must pay 2 Euros per day to make sure their valuables are safe. For a four star hotel this seems tacky and somewhat unethical. This was the only hotel in our European trip where we had to pay for a safe.
