We chose the Okura after having popped into its lobby on a previous visit to Tokyo, and were wowed by the discreet Japanese 70's styling and ambience.Our arrival lived upto the Okura's reputation- our cases were whisked away from us before we had even stepped foot in the hotel and check in was personal and deferential. We stayed in the South Wing as the main building was fully booked. As previous reviewers have noted, the South Wing is a bit of a walk from the main building and involves a walk along a plushly carpeted subway and through an arcade of little shops, but we didn't find this an inconvenience during our stay. Our standard twin room was exceptionally spacious and clean. Whilst the decor had been subject to a recent upgrade, many of the fixtures and fittings were decidedly old school, but everything functioned perfectly. The bathroom, finished in marble, had a powerful shower over the tub and there was plenty of space around the sink and every kind of lotion and toiletery you could wish for. The opaque shower panel could have done with replacing as it looked very dated but otherwise it was a great bathroom. The bedroom, as previously mentioned was huge, with a sofa, coffee table, arm chair, big desk, endless draws, bedside cabinets etc which we appreciated as we don't travel lightly! The beds were reasonably comfortable, but not brilliant- the Okura haven't adopted matress pads and white duvets like some chains.Breakfast at the Camellia cafe was expensive but very good- excellent range of fruit, pastries, cereals and some unusual and very delicious hot options. Conceierge were exceptionally helpful and the public spaces a delight to spend time in- the Japanese 70's styling is incredibly contemporary and airy, and worth a trip even if you aren't staying in the hotel.After a week's touring the alps and a few days in Kyoto we returned for a further three nights stay at the Okura. This time we stayed in the main building, but on seeing our room decided to switch back to the South Wing. Maybe it was just the room we had been allocated, but it wasn't nearly as spacious as our first room, and the styling was all over the place- an odd mix of different furniture. Also the corrdiors were rather dingy compared to the South Wing. So our luggage was transferred to a room in the South Wing which was pretty much as good as our first room with one exception- the bathroom wasn't as clean as it could be with some strange marks on the wall and ceiling. A call to house keeping quickly rectified this. Such are the standards in the hotel that we were somewhat surprised that this had gone un-noticed but at least it was dealt with promptly and with sensitivity- they offered to give us another room and were highly apologetic.Overall, I would strongly recommend the Okura- its a great quiet and upmarket location next to the American Embassy and very close to the Kamiyacho Metro stop (the quickest way to get there is to exit the main lobby at the rear and walk through the delightful bamboo grove at the back of the hotel)We piad 24,000 yen plus taxes for a room (much less than the crazy rack rate) which we concluded represented reasonable value. If you value space and old fashioned ambience and service over the latest styling and facilities the Okura is definetely worth checking out. .", "Date": "Nov 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR356767717", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Jay78uk"}, {"Content": "dont stay here unless you have to       the kimino", "Date": "Nov 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR963519693", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Jennyfenny"}, {"Content": "Nice quiet rooms I stayed here for a night and appreciated the large, quiet rooms.

Since I was on a business trip, I also needed the place to be organized and efficient. I was incredibly pleased to find that the Okura succeeded on both counts. The style of this hotel goes beyond anything I've ever seen, anywhere. Every single room and bar is an example of the best of mid-century modernism-- beautiful clean lines without being cold and sterile like newer luxury hotels. The Japanese element of the design is very strong, adding a traditional peacefulness to the modern lines. I ended up having a ball at this hotel just visiting all the different bars and feeling like a chic 1960s James Bond covert agent. If you are a fan of classic modern design, enjoy the company of unpretentious but distinguished older people (not too many hipsters at this hotel, though they'd love it if they knew about it), and have an appreciation for vintage, you'll love this hotel. As everyone else has said in the reviews, the service is excellent, the dining is good but expensive (probably not more so than other hotels in this range), and the location is convenient to metros and central Tokyo. The only thing I didn't like about the Okura was the gym/spa-- I found the steam room/sauna space awkward and unrelaxing and the temperatures all wrong. I visited a few other hotels while in Tokyo and they all seemed to be soulless and tacky compared to the Okura. The Grand Hyatt, for example, seemed so pretentious and new and boring that I couldn't wait to leave it to get back to the Okura's authentic charm.", "Date": "Apr 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR404978349", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kaytchinha"}, {"Content": "Good, solid hotel The hotel is a bit outdated decor-wise, but the service, staff and attentiveness is superb.

I am lucky enough to travel to Tokyo quite a lot and I always stay at the Okura (South Wing). Colleagues ask me why when I can stay at one of the massive chain hotels, also on the approved list. The answer is pretty simple - you just cannot fault the Okura for price, location and for comfort.A previous reviewer commented on the decor seeming old fashioned. It's like stepping into my nan's living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture. It's not true to say that it hasn't been renovated, though. Part of the beauty of the Okura is that they *do* renovate it every few years - they just keep it the same way and I kind of like that.Over the past few years, major chains such as the Grand Hyatt, Conrad (and most recently) the Ritz Carlton have opened up in Tokyo, but I am a big fan of the Japanese-style service at the Okura - honestly nothing is too much trouble, and the response time is ludicrously fast when you call for help - laundry, iron etc. The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound.Top tip for frequent visitors is the Okura Club International which you can join for nothing and entitles bearers to free usage of the pool, showers and o-furo (bath) which you would normally have to pay for. In addition, you get two laundry vouchers for complimentary shirt wash and press (really handy) and a drinks voucher, which is perfect for a quick glass of wine before you hit the sack.I have spent many a night in the Highlander Bar which is possibly the tackiest Scottish theme bar in the world, but apparently a favourite of John Lennon and Yoko Ono (The Okura's Presidential Suite was home for the lovely couple during their time in Tokyo, I am told). Even if this is an urban myth, I don't care. I really can't imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope it's true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite. Expensive though, but it is supposedly the best Chinese restaurant in Japan. Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohama's Chinatown - but it is very good if you're feeling lazy and can't be bothered to venture out of the hotel.If you're heading to Tokyo, whether it's business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - it's all good.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR846123983", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "mattoleary"}, {"Content": "Awesome stay at the Okura Just had an awesome stay at the Okura this September, '07.

Concierge was very helpful in travel and cultural needs, English is not a problem. Business center rents out mobile phones for reasonable charges which can take your GSM SIM card and allow it to be used for calls within the Japan mobile system.Location is very good and is quiet and discreet. I found that it was an easy walk to Roppongi for night life and dining as well as to a number of Toei stops for access to the rest of Tokyo. Given how good the underground system is in Tokyo, we only used a cab when leaving the hotel for Kyoto.Hotel decor, bar and restaurants. The bar on ground floor is old school, dark and quiet, which I enjoy. Lot's of Japanese malt whiskey available. We ate at both the Tempura bar and the Sushi bar. Food, preparation and presentation were superb and decent value. Breakfast is served on the lower floor by the garden. It's primarily Western style with some Japanese available. It was quite crowded around 8:30AM when we were there but that may have been due to Golden Week.Not as flashy or new as some of the competition but a hotel I really enjoyed. It's on my preferred list for Tokyo above the Westin Ebisu which is a fine place and nice location, and the Dai-Ichi which is great value. Not on my list of places I have stayed, Park Hyatt which is expensive, in the middle of nowhere and unattractive Shinjuku (forget about Lost In The Translation, go for a drink and a snack-this location is for biz travelers only) and the Grand Hyatt which another grand Asian Hyatt, glossy and expensive.", "Date": "Jul 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR348463554", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "barolobrain"}, {"Content": "Best service ever, anywhere My husband and I stayed at the Okura eight nights...We have so many words of praise for the hotel and staff that it is hard to convey here in brief.We highly recommend becoming members of the Okura Club International, which you can do for free via their website, because it really includes quite a bit of great free perks as one of the other reviewers on this website says. We also got fresh flowers put in our room the day after arriving. However, I would assume from our stay that everyone gets the same 5-star level of service which was just mind-blowing for us.We had quite a busy schedule so we didn't get to use the hotel spa/gym facilities, but we did eat breakfast in the Camelia Coffee shop and have drinks in the Highlander and Orchid bars. As an American, it is slightly unsettling to have a team of employees be at your whim and serve you as if you were their only customer. For example, when we were having breakfast, when our coffee cups became even just a bit below full, someone was ready to top them off! They also came and picked off the sugar packet wrappers from your saucer to make sure they weren't in the way! We had breakfast the last morning at the buffet in the Terrace restaurant, which is great in terms of choice. All the restaurants and bars are EXTREMELY pricey, but the level of service really does soften the blow.We stayed in the South Wing and yes, the hotel is huge. However, the elevators and hallways are all clearly marked and it really is not hard to get your way around. Again, the staff is always ready to help. One afternoon, my husband and I were going back to the South Wing from the Main lobby and it was as a staff member magically appeared to help us bustle our way through several hundred (literally here, folks!) Japanese business men coming from a conference room. The staff member prodded everyone aside and got us through the huge crowd.Our room was beautiful and spotlessly clean. The hotel provides you with slippers, yukata, luxurious toiletries, a hot tea pot with your pick of teas and fine china from which to drink it in. We also had a private fax machine with our own number that allowed us to send some faxes at only 50 yen per use-- unbelievable! Be forewarned, however, unless you have your own computer, Internet access is not friendly here....the webmail on TV is terrible and the business center is difficult to use. The beds are just heavenly, too, which is rare for any hotel in our opinion.The hotel decor is charming in its own right: it is a bit dated but it well upkept and it makes you feel as if you're in a bit of traditional Japan.The staff really go above and beyond at any time and with any question that you may have. They greet you at all times, and if you have any requests, someone appears at your door within two minutes apologizing profusely for the delay.All in all, the hotel really does deserve its listing in the Leading Hotels of the World....and we've stayed at a few in other places that didn't merit their listing. This hotel is sure not to disappoint in any single way at all. The service really makes you feel as if you have nothing to worry about and the staffs' English skills are truly above most of any other in Japan (as we experienced later in our trip).Five stars!", "Date": "Jun 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR729978792", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bonjonsc"}, {"Content": "Love the Okura My mother and I stayed this hotel only for one night but our experience was wonderful.
