{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Cheap, clean, and convenient I've stayed at the Ohana Waikiki Malia several times in the past year. Though some of the rooms need to be updated (old carpet, tired bedding) I've found it to be clean and good value for the money.Reading some of the other reviews puzzled me. The lobby is clean and modern, not at all institutional, as another reviewer has said. The staff has always been helpful and polite.What I like most about the hotel is the willingness to give extended checkout at a reasonable price -- $10 per hour. My stays in Honolulu are stopovers on long trips. I generally check in about 4 a.m., and check out at 4 p.m. Other Waikiki hotels want entire night's fee for a checkout time this late, instead of the $40 I pay to the Malia.I think it is good value for the money.", "Date": "Nov 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR848860294", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "2Nonna"}, {"Content": "Good value for Waikiki We stayed for one night, for a mini-Waikiki vacation. The rooms were clean, the staff pleasant, and although there is no pool here, the desk staff directed us to sister hotels 3 blocks away where we could use the pool. They give you a great coupon book upon checkin, and we used some of them. The AC was excellent--in fact, we were too cold and had to turn it off! There is a bit of traffic noise from the street below if you get a room without a view--but this is the middle of Waikiki after all. And the view of the lights of Waikiki that we could see from our room was great. Close to shops, restaurants, and clubs. We left the car parked and took advantage of the baggage courtesy check when we wanted to stay past checkout time. The only thing they could improve would be to give better directions to the parking garage. The Kuhio St. entrance is very steep and narrow; we left some rubber! Lewers is better.

For the rate it was decent and clean...comfort wise, I preferred the Beachcomber. Liked the pay internet service in the lobby since we didn't bring our laptop. If you don't use up your paid minutes you can write down an access code and use the unused time later on. Dined at the IHOP next door, fast friendly service. Bus stop for Diamond Head was across the street and free trolley depot behind the hotel. Convenient location.Okay if you are on a budget or spend most of the time at the beach. We opted for late check out since our flight wasn't until 9pm. $10/hour charge for each hour after the normal noon checkout time.

We requested a crib for our infant and to have a room near the laundry room because I was planning on washing soccer uniforms every night. Both requests were fufilled. Another plus was that we were located near an ice machine which is very convenient for us to fill our coolers for the long day at the soccer fields. The parking stalls were also in very close proximity to our rooms. This made it convenient for us to lug the soccer and baby gear to our van each morning. We stayed in a suite. The master bedroom was roomy enough to place the baby's crib right in next to me. The separate room allowed my sons to sleep through the night without being awakened by their sister's crying in the middle of the night. I requested two twin beds for the living room. This was a big plus because I didn't have to listen to the boys fight all night long, he's touching me..he's hogging the blankets The rooms were clean. The beds were okay but I am used to sleeping on Tempurpedic mattresses at home. IHOP is right downstairs. No need to find a restaurant in Waikiki and then find parking or have to pay for parking. This was very convenient.Parking was a bit scary at times. The parking garage ramps are steep and narrow. We have officially named this the soccer hotel. It is perfect for families traveling for tournaments. I would not stay here for vacation but we will definitely stay here again for our future tournaments.

We travel to Hawaii nearly every year. This was the first time we have stayed at this hotel, though we have stayed at an Ohana brand hotel before.Our room--1516--had lots of problems. The air conditioner in that room is about to die, as evidenced by the constant loud rattle of the fan. We didn't use it much because it was so noisy, and it had a bad odor. The carpet is very worn and stained. The refrigerator door is hanging by one hinge and must be lifted to get it to close. We also didn't use the dresser drawers because they were disgusting. When we notified the front desk, we were told the brown, smeared stains were paint. It looked quite a bit like something else, and the drawers were musty-smelling. The entire room was dusty. My parents were staying in the room next door, which had an OK carpet, a nice refrigerator, a working and quiet air conditioner, but still musty in the dresser drawers.If you like to sit on the lanai, stay elsewhere. The Malia's lanais are so tiny you can't even get a chair out there. The Malia is on Kuhio, a busy, noisy street. If noise bothers you and you choose to stay here, bring earplugs or buy some at the ABC Store across the street. The Malia is a long walk to the beach and has no pool. You can use the pool at the Ohana Maile Skycourt, Ohana West or Ohana East, though these hotels are as far away as the beach and their pools close early (8 or 9 PM depending on the hotel). We didn't even take the time to look at the available pools.We used the laundry facilities at the Malia. The washers are fine. It costs 2 dollars to wash. The dryers cost $1.50 to dry, but the inefficient dry cycle is only about 25 minutes, so it actually cost me $4.50 to dry a half load of lightweight cotton clothes. The laundry is on the 5th floor of a very dark, deserted garage that is open to the public. Kind of scary.The good things: Front desk staff was fine. For most of our stay the housekeeping staff did a good job and was pleasant. (We did have one fellow for a day or two who did a really lousy job.) Free daily coffee for the in-room coffee maker and free daily newspaper was much appreciated. Free rides on the Pink Trolley is a useful perk. Rooms are large for Waikiki, with a real bathtub in the bathroom instead of just a shower. I might stay here again IF the management would fix the air conditioner, do something about the really gross carpet, replace the refrigerator, paint the inside of those drawers, and keep them clean with an occasional bleach and water scrubbing.", "Date": "Feb 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR531896957", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Kiwi_Cook"}, {"Content": "STAY AWAY!

The room was on the small side, but clean and fresh, with fairly comfortable beds. The six dresser drawers were pretty nasty, however; only one was clean enough to use. The bathroom was a nice size, with good water pressure and constant hot water. Nice central air conditioning (although the cover plate for the controls was missing; instead, it was labeled with a sharpie: Hi, Lo, Off). Very small lani (balcony) without any furniture (only 1 small chair would fit anyway). The biggest drawback are the very thin walls and windows. Heard all the noises on the street from our 11th floor room (facing Kuhio Ave.). Even worse, you can hear every sound from neighboring rooms, from toilets flushing to alarms going off. Not to mention guests socializing in the hallway all night long and the endless slamming of doors. Most of the guests seem to be either young party people or military, at least over the 4th of July holiday. The location is great, maybe a 10-minute walk to the beach (if you go thru the Waikiki Sheraton). City buses and the Hilo Hattie trolley are right outside the door; other trolleys are right around the corner at the DFS Galleria. Extra charges: parking garage was $15 a day, $3 a day to use the room's safe, $2 if you use the supplied bag of kona coffee. There was a free newspaper outside your door each morning. The front desk provides you with beach towels (which are actually just the same small bath towels that are in the bathrooms). There is a newly opened IHOP restaurant adjacent to the hotel, recently converted from the old Malia Cafe. Nice, new decor, very crowded for weekend breakfast.

The room was dirty, the curtains were stained from smoke (even though it was a non smoking room), the entire room had a sickly sweet smoke smell to it, and the ceiling was stained. The carpet was thin and stained and not something you wanted to walk on in our bare feet. The bed sheets were stained. The air conditioner sounded like a jet engine taking off making it impossible to keep on while trying to sleep. The noise from the street was terrible, and the other guests in the hotel seemed to all get home at 3am and need to run up and down the halls and slam doors to announce that. The only reason I gave this hotel two stars instead of one was because of the suprisingly clean and renovated bathroom, I almost wanted to sleep in there.

We were placed on the 9th floor (top floor), with a nice view of the city. The layout of the suite consists of a lounge room with two single beds made up as day beds and then the main bedroom, it also has a small kitchenette to prepare meals. The large balcony makes is perfect to sit there and enjoy the city and the mountains in the background. The decor was very nice and these rooms had just been recently renovated.

The walls are kind of thin though - when I was lying on my bed I could hear the people next door in the bathroom.They're doing major renovations on the hotel/condos across the road, and my room had a view of the construction site/workers so i had to keep my curtains closed most of the time - only a problem for even-numbered rooms, other side of the hotel would be fine. The lanai is teeny-tiny (can just barely fit one chair on it and really not even suitable for drying washing). I don't care that there's no swimming pool (it's Waikiki, i'd rather go to the beach!). However, that also means there's no place where you can have a shower or get changed if you have a late flight (I had a 10-hour flight leaving around midnight, and felt really crusty cos i couldn't have a shower after spending the day snorkelling - just had a cold-water rinse at the beach). there were some people from the UK complaining about the same thing so it's not just me.

This would put me off staying there again - all the other hotels i've stayed at in Waikiki have had a hospitality room or a gym for people to shower/get changed in before a late departure.", "Date": "Dec 29, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR505790016", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "flyingmonkey"}, {"Content": "The allround Malia My wife and i stayed at the Malia for 7 nights at the start of november 05, with not one problem to be had.Stayed on the 17th floor and the only noise was the cop cars sirens at night but not that often, (once every three nights). I asked other tourists from other hotels and they said the same thing. Hotel had everything but a pool, great little cafe for breakfast and dinner, a tourist counter was a great help with our sight-seeing, and a really good concierge service. Would really recommend to a couple with only shopping in mind or a family on a budget, because you can use the pools from the other Ohana hotels which is what we did and it was great to talk to other tourists outside your hotel.
