The hotel was nasty. The bathroom consist of a small standing shower, even for my father who is fairly skinny it was a tight squeeze. The toliet was right against the bathroom entrance door. Almost all of our towels was stained to a very gross degree. The sink was in the bedroom area, which was held up by two wooden boards. The bed sheets were stained, we ALL slept on top of the comforters. The room was run down and dirty. Not to mention I have never stayed in a hotel down in Ocean City where the seagulls were so loud. The stairs leading up to our room were dirty and there were dead bugs all over them. Honestly if all the other hotels in decent price range hadn't been booked solid, we would have left to another hotel. It was an okay hotel to grab a few z's and a quick shower that night, but I would never rent a room at this hotel again... You couldn't pay me enough to stay here again.The only positives I can list are I have worked at a hotel in my past, so I know what to look for when it comes to bed bugs, which I did once I saw how nasty our rooms were, I did NOT see any signs of bedbugs in the room we were in.

I wanted to stay on the boardwalk, yet most places were either booked or much more than I was looking spend. A friend of mine suggested the Shoreham, said she knew of a few people that stay there every year. After reading the reviews, I was a little hesitant. I looked at several other hotels, motels, and condos, And finally just decided to take a chance and book at the Shoreham. I booked king oceanfront room. I prepared myself for the possibility of a complete dive, as many boardwalk hotels are. But I must say, I wasn't disappointed. The location could not have been better. We had arrived early and were able to check in by 10:30 am. The parking lot is small and secure, right behind the hotel. We had a 3rd floor, side front room, so there were two windows in the front, one on the side, and one in the bathroom. All from which you can see the boardwalk and the ocean. The room was clean and bright. There was a window AC unit, which worked very well, small refrigerator w/small freezer, TV , closet, just your basics. A simple room is all we needed. We are never ones to spend our vacation in the room for longer than we need to be. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The bar beneath the hotel has great food and drink. When heading out at night, we could hear the noise from the restaurant on the first floor, but the boardwalk is a busy place, it's part of the excitement of staying on the boardwalk. There were a few cons, the biggest one was the stairs.. I'm an active person, but carrying the luggage up was a task, otherwise stairs don't bother me much. Other cons, the comforters are definitely outdated, the floors are a little slanted, no coffee maker, and the power went out while using my hair dryer (called the front desk and they corrected the problem quickly). Overall, however, the pros outweigh the cons. Bottom line is, if you are looking for an affordable, clean, simple place on the boardwalk, the Shoreham is a great place to consider. If you are looking for frills and luxury, this is not for you.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waynesboro, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Room , Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Ted Z", "ReviewID": "UR134201432", "Content": "Stayed here as a result of A/C problems at a friends condo.

Yes, the first floor could hear the music from the bar below but it was just us- no kids- so no big deal if we stayed there. The bathroom was clean and stocked with soaps and plenty of nicely arranged towels. If you are a larger person you may have some trouble feeling comfortable in the stall shower. We checked the room for uninvited pests before bringing or bags in and were very happy to find no evidence at all. Ice machine and Coke vending machine on the first floor.

I love older, locally-owned places and gave this place a try despite mixed reviews. Here are my own... Pros: The staff were all friendly, and the woman who booked my reservation by phone was really nice, answering a bunch of questions. There is a typical Irish pub below the hotel; I was afraid it would be noisy and it wasn't. The food and service there were pretty good. The location is great - right on the boardwalk near several restaurants/bars/stores/the beach, etc. Cons: This place is need of some serious renovation and upkeep! The decor is lacking, but that's nothing too major. The floors, however, are slanted enough that I was seriously concerned about the building's structure. The mini fridge didn't work and smelled awful. The bathroom was TINY! and the shower only trickled. The bathroom door didn't shut well. There were no curtains - only cheap slatted blinds - on the windows, so the east-facing room was incredibly bright in the morning. The walls are very thin so we could hear neighbors easily. Housekeeping never came (we were there for two nights). The remote control didn't work. There were stains on some of the furniture. And worst of all, we paid extra for an ocean-front room that was 1. obscured in part by a roof below us and 2. totally not worth it - I was picturing a balcony, or at least a window that opened up so I could feel the breeze. The window opened only a few inches, and we were so on top of the boardwalk people just stared in when the blinds were drawn anyway. Do NOT bother paying more for oceanfront!! The building's entrance is on the side, in a parking log. It's near the staff entrance of the Irish pub - so you walk in amid a parking lot, garbage, and people hanging out smoking. Also, I was told there's a public pool across the street. I'm not sure if it's technically public - it has a public entrance because it's adjacent to a bar that's open to the public - but it's part of another hotel! If this were a hostel I would think it was alright - but for a proper hotel, for the price, I will not stay there again and would not recommend it to friends/family.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "cumberland, md", "Title": "\u201cnot the worst but not the best\u201d", "Author": "alison d", "ReviewID": "UR75662669", "Content": "hey there. i stayed here with just my husband last year during bike week. we were kinda doing a second short honeymoon before my second child was born..the hotel has a great location. and for the price we couldnt beat that...not during bike week at least. but if you are looking for a nice hotel with a view and elevator et cetera this isnt the place. the staff was very nice. they accomadated my husband since he is a smoker. they let him smoke in the room as long as the window was open.walking up all them stairs when you are pregnant not fun but its def. good exercise..would i stay there again??yeah but not with my kids. i have two young ones and carrying them up all the steps forget it. but if you are looking for a cheap stay for only two nights and then its your place. the only downfall was because it was bike week you could hear them revving their engines to almost 3am in the morning...the noise factor kinda sucked but minus that the rest of the hotel wasnt bad", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201chad an amazing vacation...\u201d", "Author": "edithmeli", "ReviewID": "UR73740625", "Content": "to begin with the hotel was located on the boardwalk!!
