I was visiting a friend who was at a hospice home and this was a very convenient location for me. The rooms I thought were well decorated and comfortable. The check in staff were so welcoming and accomodating. The price was right and I appreciated the full breakfast offered. Also the noise in between the rooms was fairly quiet which is always a big plus. Unfortunately I didn't sleep well here on one of the nights I stayed because of the rude loud guests and kids outside of the room at all hours of the night. Also the staff person that checked me out when I left was really rude.

To call the location \"Metrocenter\" is a bit of a stretch as the Metrocenter Complex is at least one mile (if not more) north of the hotel, but it's an easy drive by car via the frontage road. Years ago this hotel was a first-generation Hampton Inn and all the rooms are accessed via outdoor corridors rather than the favored indoor hallways. If you want quiet be sure to get a room by the pool; other rooms, especially those facing the freeway, are going to be a bit noisier. (Although, during warmer months when the pool is getting heavy use the rooms facing the freeway may be quieter.) My experience was quite positive; my plane arrived well before Noon and when I called the hotel and asked to check-in early I was told, \"Come on over! I'll find you a room!\" (Truth be told, the hotel wasn't very busy that weekend; it was Thanksgiving.) The front desk had my reservation in order upon arrival; one signature and I was on my way to my room. I seem to recall paying about $65 a night and got a clean room overlooking the pool. They trumpet their \"housekeeping awards\" on their website and I will allow that my room was very, very clean. (The bathroom, while clean, was a bit dated.) My sister was staying in another room and she remarked how clean her room was, and my sister is very, very picky. There were plenty of towels, soap and shampoo. The front desk staff was friendly at check-in and check-out. The business center in the lobby worked fine. The outdoor pool and hot tub were both clean and operational, but it was really too cold for either. I only stayed one night so I am not qualified to comment about on-going housekeeping, but my sister (who stayed 4 nights) reported a sparkling clean room with piles of fresh towels on a daily basis. (And yes, we do tip the housekeeping staff so that may have had something to do with it.) I wanted a clean, comfortable room at a reasonable price and I got it.

The maint staff was on it within 5- 10 min on call. They tried to repair it nd when it was not posible - simply replaced it immediately. You might spy housekeeping staff smoking on the hallways next to the cart through your window - but never in front of guests. The pool and spa, though i never used it - looked clean, and also popular. Of course with people, alos comes smoking, some drinking and noise. The stay is a no frills experience. Clean decent rooms. Clean bed and clean bathroom. The carpets might be smightly worn out and not too plush and so would the towels be - but they are clean and very much in acceptable state. Breakfast is excellent and wholesome - and much better than what you get in many other hotels. There are couple of mexican restaurants right next - so lunch and dinner is also quite comfortable. About the location - its right off the freeway. VEry close to airport and a lot of other places in Phoenix. It worked well for me as it was close to my office.

We got to our room, and we were pleasantly surprised with how clean it was. Nice layout, plenty of space, decent channel selection, the bed wasn't too hard... Thought we'd made a good decision, so we left for dinner (with nowhere to put any left-overs)... Since this hotel is right off the busy I-17, we were concerned with the noise factor. Turns out, the freeway noise wasn't noticable from our room! However, we heard every person walking up & down the stairs all night and early the next morning. We heard every door nearby slam. Usually I'd just turn on the fan to cover up that kind of noise, but the A.C. unit in these rooms doesn't have a fan that stays on, it just blows loudly for 5-10 minutes and doesn't come back on for 30 (anybody familiar with this area at all knows that a good A.C. is EXTREMELY important!) At 8 a.m. the landscapers started up with the leaf blowers and lawn mowers. So since I'm up, I'll go to the \"Breakfast Buffet\" (Ha! Better get there earlier than that if you want something other that stale bagles/muffins and room temp milk & cereal) and then requested a later check-out, hoping that we could eventually get some rest before a long day of driving, but instead it got noisier... After the landscapers left, the hotel decides to pressure wash all of the walkways (powered by a VERY loud air compressor). After accepting that we were not going to get anymore sleep, we did take a nice shower. Pretty sad when the highlight of your stay is a decent shower head... To be fair, we have stayed in worse. But it just seemed to one thing after another. The icing on the cake (since this was a birthday trip, after all...) was when we checked out. Brought up the noise problem to the front desk, and didn't get so much as an appology. \"Oh. They're cleaning the floors.\" Really? Well, thanks for clearing that up! Then we got to the car, parked downstairs from our room, only to find that all the nasty run-off from their floors had splashed all over my newly detailed car. And so I said, \"I need to write a review for this place!\" You'll read mixed reviews here. I did. That's part of the reason I chose this hotel.

And of course, it disappeared. Then he decides to go and get some spray at which point I am ready to walk out in my PJs. They gave us another room which they said was a newly renovated one. Did not look so to me. Early next morning when we tried to use the toilet, there was no water. Then my husband figured that the tap to the toilet was not open. But the toilet water ran once in a while after that making this annoying noise. Probably that is why it was shut off. After returning from a long day of activities, we could not get into the room since our cards were not working (we had two). I had to go to the front desk and activate the cards again. I have had breakfasts in places like La Quinta and Ramada and they are decent. They are not fancy but give a good basic filling one needs to start the day. I was expecting something along that line but it was very disappointing. The toaster was not working. They figured then that the outlet was not working. The sausages and eggs were plugged into that outlet. Therefore, there was no heat on them either, how long, I am not sure (health violation ?). They did not even have any fruits. Other than that, there was the normal items - coffee, juice, cereal, bread and waffle. Close to the highway makes this place easy to get in and out. There are plenty of restaurants around. That said, we will definitely not stay in this place again. The front desk guy told us that the place is being renovated and we got a renovated room. If they call this renovation, I am not sure how it was before.
