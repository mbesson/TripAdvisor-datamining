The hotel sits on a busy street with Tapas Bars literally side by side down the whole street, even the hotel has a Tapas bar and restuarant. This made it super easy to find somewhere to eat as the choice was amazing. Our room was extremely comfortable, the bed is king size and the pillows were really the most comfortable I've ever slept on in a hotel, wished I could have taken them home! The bathroom is nice with a rain head shower and toiletries were topped up daily. Wifi was okay, sometimes it was slow. I was concerned that the room may be noisy as we faced onto the main street, but the shutters and double glazing really cut out most of the noise, but I do admit we got into Spanish life, staying up late, so by the time we did go to bed, things had quietened down. We were in Madrid over a weekend and there was a noticeable difference between how busy the street was on Saturday night to Sunday and Monday. But definitely don't be concerned about noise, it really was not a factor. We found the staff to be friendly and we were always greeted coming in and out of the hotel. We did not have breakfast or eat in the restaurant but we did have some tapas and drinks in the bar which was really nice and good spot for a night cap. I would highly recommend this hotel, the location is superb, comfort levels are excellent and reasonable price for Madrid. If I return to Madrid I'll be sure to stay here again.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cUnique, small hotel in Madrid\u201d", "Author": "JTea", "ReviewID": "UR138123607", "Content": "We stayed in this small hotel for the last night of our trip to Spain, but I wish we had been able to stay here for several more days.

My husband and I and our two kids had two adjoining rooms that had small balconies. The location is great - a quiet street but near lots of restaurants, etc. There is an excellent fruit market a few doors down. When we arrived, we were served a wine drink (juice for the kids) while we completed the paperwork. The breakfast was not included in our rate, but by paying the day before for the next morning's breakfast, there was a discount. The breakfast didn't look like much at first, but a server will bring coffee, juice, and eggs cooked to order. Excellent croissants. I recommend eating here before heading out for the day.

While there were one or two things we would have like to have had available to us, we can have no argument over the price of the room for a week in high season. Madrid was very hot at the end of July and packed with tourists, so the return each afternoon to a airconditioned room with fresh linen, a large TV and interesting modern furniture was greatly appreciated. The maid service too was excellent - we were often late up and out, and they were quite patient in waiting for us to leave before cleaning our room. I could have wished for a lock on the bathroom door (something the hotel can fix), and that our room had a balcony on which we could sit and watch the world go by once the children had gone to bed (less easily fixable) and also perhaps that the breakfasts had been priced slightly lower which might have enticed my family to indulge (rather than survive on cereal bars). Oh, and the mini-bar could have been colder. For these points, the hotel gets 4 out of 5. There are simply some things that cannot be changed about Madrid which one simply has to accept e.g. - the high prices of beer - the insistence of all restaurants to rip you off through charging for covers (reduce your end-of-meal tip if you do not agree with this practice) - the inability of 95% of any restaurant serving pizza (my kids don't do Spanish food!) to serve you anything other than a sloppy cheese-fest (the one exception being on the south eastern corner of Plaza Mayor which did a lovely plate of pasta for about 8 Euros. - the beggars - the heinous price of the theme park near the zoo. The zoo is fairly heinously priced as well but it is a very enjoyable afternoon's entertainment. But on the whole, very reasonable value in a high-priced city.

We were not put off by the duty managers attempt at a rebuff but to their credit we eventually got an apology and a free drink after some remonstration. - We asked for a family room and this consisted of a queen bed and a pull down double. This was too small for our teenage son and also with the bed down, there was not much room to move around. Not really a proper family sized room. - The bar stopped serving drinks at 10:30.

Stayed here for only two nights and am glad to have done so. I liked this small hotel quite a bit. The location on Calle Cava Baja in La Latina feels more 'neighborhood-y' in the sense that, at night time, people come to enjoy the many tapas bars and restaurants along the street. In the morning and during the day, the area was quite peaceful even though it's only a stone's throw from the Plaza Mayor and Sol. My room (not the smallest, nor the largest of the three types available) was quite large and looked over the Calle Cava Baja. I was concerned about the potential for noise, but the sound insulation provided by the double-glazed windows was excellent and I slept exceptionally well. Nice things about the room included clean lines, a huge flat-screen TV, memory-foam mattress, two kinds of pillows, modern tub/shower/toilet/sink, nice tubes of bath products, lots of lighting options, abundant plugs, a large safe, and this sort of clothes-hanger thing that was separate from the hangers in the closet. Clearly a lot of thought went into the design of the rooms. I ate at the little tapas bar in the lobby and thought the food was of a high quality. Particularly enjoyed the tosta with jamon iberico and salmorejo as well as the croquetas with spinach, bacalao, pine nuts and raisins. The sangria was really nice, too. The only small drawback, and I suppose an inevidible effect of a room that's almost entirely white, is that small scuffs show up easily on the floors and walls. Nothing major, but noticeable here and there. Similarly, in an all-white bathroom, spots on the grout and dirt on the caulking show up easily. I imagine that, in time, the hotel will need to do a thorough 'once-over' to restore the rooms' original shine. I'd add that the price certainly was right... I booked many weeks in advance and took the risk that my plans wouldn't change. Paid 100 euros a night and consider that pretty much a bargain for the location and quality of the room.

I wrote back that this is not my fault since i had tried to contact the hotel many times and they never replied. I never heard from the hotel again. And I know that they have received my email! I am still looking for hotel in Madrid and I certainly don't recommend this hotel to anyone!", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu", "Title": "\u201cStay Away!\u201d", "Author": "Randy808", "ReviewID": "UR120237724", "Content": "Horrible experience!

Location: in the middle of the Madrid bohemia. If good food, wine and general hedonism are your thing \u2013 this is the place for you. The street in which this inn is located (Calle cava baja) and the entire area are filled to the brim with restaurants, bars, tapas places and what not. Every night and especially during the weekends the area looks like a huge party is going on. It's walking distance to plaza mayor and plaza puerta de sol (5 minutes) and also to the opera house, palace and gran via (10-15 minutes). There is also a close by metro station. You can get here from the airport using the metro, it costs something like 3 Euros but you do need to change the line twice and it takes about 40 minutes. Taxi on a Sunday morning cost us 46 Euros. The rooms: the place is new and recently renovated so everything looks new and nice. Our room however was tiny. The queen bed took up most of it. This is a problem if you need some space or if you intend to work in the room (it's basically impossible). Despite the party going on every night when you close the window you can hardly here the sounds (our room faced the patio; I don't know what happens in the rooms facing the street). There is supposedly a free WI-FI. It had not worked even once during our 3 days stay, we asked them to take care of it twice but somehow they were not able to so we just gave up. The food: this is a restaurant/bar after all. You can have very cheap great coffee in the little bar down stairs and also good food (definitely not continental rather hard core Spanish). You can also have an excellent dinner during the evenings at the restaurant (beware the place is packed every night, especially during weekends so if you intend to eat there let them know in advance). Being a \"Taberna\" they have a mind boggling array of wines and alcoholic beverages. The staff were always nice, mostly efficient (except for the WI-FI part), and even made sure we knew the clock was about to change so we won't have unexpected surprises during the morning. we arrived early so they talked to the maid to preapare our room so we won't have to wait too long. We speak Spanish but I saw them speaking in fluent English with other guests so that also shouldn't be a problem. All in all: if you are looking to stay in the middle of the Madrid hedonistic charm in a lively, simpatic hotel this is it. The two major cons were the size and the WI-FI not working. This is not a good place for a business stay but excellent for a romantic getaway or just plain having fun.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cIt is called a 'singular' hotel.\u201d", "Author": "ColinY", "ReviewID": "UR119306958", "Content": "The staff are the most welcoming and helpful, the rooms are well designed and beautifully kept, the location is unusual but ideal for a weekend of sightseeing and, Yes, I'd really like to keep it to myself - singular ;-)", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, some design issues\u201d", "Author": "Charles E", "ReviewID": "UR119163719", "Content": "We recently stayed in this hotel for our trip to Spain (3 nights each in Madrid, Seville and Barcelona).

Overall I would rate it a 4 as the location and updated aspects of the hotel outweighed the design and spacial setbacks. Positive Aspects of the Hotel: - Modern and updated, both lobby and rooms - Location is great, within short walking distance to areas of interest - Cleanliness was never an issue - Friendly staff, willing to help with whatever is needed (directions, access to services, etc.) - Secured by locked front door late at night, with attendant at desk 24 hours Negative Aspects of the Hotel: - Rooms are small, with sink in the bedroom about 2-3 feet from the bed - Bathroom is small, with little room to maneuver - Shower and sink do not drain well, shower could potentially overrun into floor if you are not careful - Can be a touch noisy at times with the bustling traffic downstairs", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201ca modern hotel in a good location.\u201d", "Author": "Cheeky_Porky", "ReviewID": "UR118689999", "Content": "The location is very good as it is near to mercado de san miguel, the square, sol and most of all it is located in the heart of the cava baja where tapas bar are everywhere. the surrounding area have very good restaurants too.

The best sangria!!! Very good finger foods too. I\u2019m only giving this hotel 4* rating because 1st \u2013 there is no room service. No information about the hotel in the room. most of all coz they did not clean our room on our 2nd day. When we came back to our room (around 6pm), it was undone. I called the reception and they asked me if we hanged the \u201cdo not disturbed sign\u201d. NO we did not! So he asked when they can come and cleaned. Informed him around 9pm as we are heading out for dinner. When we came back, the only thing they did were replace the mini bar and lousily made the bed. The old towels were left in the tub, the toilet has not been cleaned as well as the basin and trash can. Disappointing Will I recomend this hotel? YES.

We had room with balcony facing the street and when we arrived late at night It was very busy so my first thought was: there is no way I can sleep with that street noice. To my big surprise, inside of the room I hardly could hear street noice, good isolated room and I had perfect sleep both nights. I must admit you can hear some noice from the restaurant inside the courtyard but it did not bother me at all as they close quite early compared to Madrid standard. Room was big, nice decorated and with comfortable bed. The bathroom was good size too, semi open, with great rain shower and nice cosmetic products. What I liked is that there is possibility to have breakfast not only in restaurant but as well in their bar/cafe next to reception. They serve coffe, delicious fresh croissants, spanish toast for a very reasonable price.
