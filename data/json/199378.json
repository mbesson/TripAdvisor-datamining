The hotel provided a free cot bed in one of the rooms for our 10 yr old. Hotel has an excellent location. Its vicinity to the Friedrichstrasse train station gives you access to an Edeka supermarket inside the station that is open 7 days per week; there you can get loaded up on drinks and snacks at supermarket prices. Large hotel lobby with bright modern art provides a good setting to relax on one of the many sofas after a long day out (great spot to people watch). The hotel's pool, sauna and steam room also work great to wind down after a long day of sightseeing (specially if you have kids). We did not use the TV so can't comment on the channels. Beds were typical of what you find in German Hotels: two single beds, not the best but they do the job. Don't now about air conditioning in the room since we slept with the windows open as the night were cool. Internet at the hotel is expensive and rather slow but you have a Starbucks that is not even 5 minutes away that offers excellent free WIFI with any purchase. Breakfast buffet at hotel looked very nice but again too expensive for us, so we ate breakfasts at Starbucks, a German bakery or at Dunkin Donuts (all just steps from the hotel on Friedrichstrasse) for a fraction of the cost of the hotel's buffet. Many fun restaurants are located near the Oranienburger Tor tram stop and Kunsthaus Tacheles (about 15/20 minutes easy walk from the hotel - take a left on Friedrichstrasse and walk past the river). BTW many Berlin restaurants are reasonable priced compared to restaurants located elsewhere in Europe (we found most main courses cost around 10 euros), and the meals offered very good size portions too. We had sit down lunch in many places for around 7 euros/person (such as at Dada Falafel - a falafel platter and a drink) If you are able physically, you should rent bikes for one day if the weather is good. You can rent them at the hotel's concierge (they have a few available) but if you have kids, there's a bike rental place that have kids' bikes too and it's a little cheaper than at the hotel ( the bike rental store is left at main entrance and then the first right). BTW If the weather is nice bikes get sold out quickly. With the bikes you can see most of the main Berlin sights very quickly, and there are bike lanes in most streets. It was fun to ride in the Tiergarden past the Prime Minister's residence, towards the part that used to be West Berlin, past ugly Alexandex Platz, and by the parks around the Berlin Cathedral. All of these place are easy to do in a few hours if you're on a bike. Don't miss a visit to Postdam while in Berlin; we took the 12 euro/adult ( kids are free) trip with New Berlin Sandeman's - in addition to the cost of the tour, you'll pay for the cost of the public transport. But this is only suitable for those that can do a lot of walking. BTW Many Berlin visitor's cards offer unlimited public transport travel, but in my humble opinion if you can walk, they are not necessary as most everything to see is within walking distance. For far away places (Postdam or the Olympic stadium) you can just buy singles trips and you will still come way ahead. If you're going to do just one museum don't miss the Pergamon (we walked there from the hotel in about 20 minutes). If the weather is nice, take a boat tour (you can jump on board on left side to the bridge before you cross the river) - again left on Friedrichstrasse as you leave the hotel. The Maritim Proarte hotel is a great base for a Berlin visit if you get a room at a good price and if you stay away from spending money within the hotel's property (internet, mini bar, breakfast buffet costs at the hotel are too high). Get a good room rate and then eat out and you have a great deal in your hands with this Maritim.

It is a beautiful hotel in the heart of Berlin near a major train and U-bahn station. You can take the S-bahn from the airport right to the hotel. It is a two minute walk from the station to the hotel. Likewise you are one station away from the Hauptbahnhof in Berlin. The staff were courteous and helpful at all times. We loved that you could open the windows in the room. The view outside the windows was spectacular. The breakfast buffet was the best we encountered during our 6 city trip. It was not included in in our room price but it still was worth it. Internet is available; however, you must pay extra. The in-room safe was too small for a laptop computer; however, the hotel has larger safety deposit boxes at reception. Just ask the staff and they will make a box available for you. The hotel is just around the corner from the street Unter den Linden. This street leads you to the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag (a 10 minute walk). Make sure you visit the dome at the Reichstag but be prepared for a wait. Also on Unter den Linden is the Opera and its Cafe. The Cafe provides an excellent lunch and supper. Staff at the hotel recommended going to a local restaurant (3 minute walk) called Zur Nolle. Great suggestion and moderately priced. It's right under the train station lines. Take the hop and hop off tour of Berlin. You can catch it around the corner on Unter den Linden. You can purchase tickets form the Concierge. Just be careful to keep your ticket handy if you are checked and be back to your hotel stop before 6 o'clock otherwise you will be dropped off at the nearest stop and then you will have to take the U-bahn back to your hotel. Take a walk on Kurf\u00fcrstendamm Strasse, the 5th Avenue of Berlin and take a tour of Charlottenburg Castle. Take time to visit the Castle's gardens. Next trip we will go the museums in Berlin. We just ran out of time.

I went to Berlin in 2004 and stayed at the Crowne Plaza near the Kurfurstenstrasse, although a very nice hotel, it's a bit far if you want to see the historic part rather than the shopping area. The Maritim proarte is in a fantastic location with an entrance on Freidrichstrasse and the main entrance on Dorotheen. A 2 minute walk brings you onto Unter Den Linden with its excellent cafes and bars (Einstein is really good and Nanteck was very nice in the evenings). The Gendarmenmarkt, Willhelm st, Check Point Charlie, Forum Fridericianum, Brandenburg Gate & Reichstag are all a gentle stroll. I managed to get 4 nights for the price of 3 on b&b (lucky travel agent) and believe this was excellent value for money. The room was very comfortable apart from the soft pillow on the bed but we asked housekeeping for more and they promptly delivered so no worries there. The bathroom was clean and bright and the shower quite powerful, there was also a speaker in the bathroom so you could here the TV if you wanted to. The buffett breakfast was one of the best I have seen in a hotel (and I have stayed in many), service was prompt and the selection was vast. They even have a menu card showing the healthy items within the buffett so you could be good if you wanted to. The lobby area is bright with lots of sofas and art pieces on display. The hotel is non smoking. The bar did not open until 5pm which i thought a bit strange for a city hotel but I do think this is due to the many business guests that will be in conference until this time so not really catering for the non business clients. Not to worry because there is a really nice little bar on the next street (Mittlestrasse). Apart from breakfast we didn't eat in the hotel so can not comment on the restaurants, however there was a Bistro, Buffett and full service restaurant within the hotel.

The hotel was developed around a very nice idea of putting modern art from different artist all over the hotel and a different artist on every floor. Unfortunately, it is not easy to access floors, room key gives you access to only your floor. The hotel itself has little charm and a few over priced restuarnts. The breakfast buffet in the Gallerie restaurant was good with food options for travelers from the US and Europe. Internet access was 15 euros a night. Rooms were shabby and needed to be refurbished.

Negatives include very expensive internet \u2013 even the local Starbucks right across the street didn\u2019t offer free wifi. Also their gym left something to be desired such as a lack of weight equipment \u2013 there were only a few cardio machines. Also the hotel restaurants were over priced. Breakfast in particular. There are many small cafes and breakfast places on the same block for more then half the price. There were only about 1.5 English channels since one was sometimes English and sometimes other languages and they did not have NASN (North American sports network) for those sports fans. As for the beds, we had requested a queen and as often experienced in Europe it was two doubles pushed together. Additionally the pillows and comforters were down with no alternatives available so if you\u2019re allergic you might want to come prepared. Also there is currently construction taking place adjacent to the hotel \u2013 which our room faced. However that didn\u2019t pose a problem as they stopped work at night and we were out of the room during the day.

I was on the 11th floor, whose theme was 'Homosexuality'. If you are easily offended by the concept, you probably shouldn't visit Berlin, which must be one of the most gay-friendly cities in Europe. However, if you don't want to be reminded as you head for breakfast every morning, you might not want a room on this floor. The 11th is also a smoking floor - I had booked a non-smoking room but arrived quite late and didn't disocver the mistake until I was inside the room. However, it had good airconditioning and was well-cleaned so I decided not to make a big deal out of it. The breakfast was outstanding and the service pretty good - a blown light bulb was promptly replaced. The bathroom was also clean and well-maintained. The biggest downside was probably its proximity to the US embassy and its fortifications, which close off one end of the adjacent street to cars and place pedestrians under some very hostile surveillance. The Russian embassy, in contrast, manages with one sleepy police officer out front. Has to be a moral here somewhere.

We were pleasantly surprised by our room and the hotel location. I read reviews on this hotel and am very happy we chose it. We had an apartment on the 3rd floor. We had no view, but didn't really care because we were not in there too much. Our room had a small living room and seperate bedroom. The couch folded out to a bed for our 5 and 3 year old, and the hotel provided a crib for our 1 year old. The room was kept very clean, as was the rest of the hotel. They also have an indoor swimming pool. My 5 year old loved it, but it was a bit too cold for Dad and the 3 year old. So, they drank a smoothie from the pool bar and watched. Our biggest mistake was thinking that breakfast was included in our rate... it wasn't. My husband and I were charged 19 Euro a day each, all 3 children were free. Actually, as much as my children ate, we probably came out ahead. I can not imagine what was missing from the breakfast buffet. There were meats, cheeses, breads, fruits, yogurt, cereal, eggs, omelet station, bacon, sausages, and waffles. It was huge and kept pretty well stocked every morning... even when it was very busy. But, just so you know... there is a bakery, a Dunkin Donuts, and a Starbucks right outside of the hotel. I also want to mention a restaurant close by that is well worth stopping in. It is just across Unter den Linden to the right. It's called Pepitos and it is wonderful... try the Pepito special. The location was a great bonus. There is a bus stop 2 minutes outside the hotel and a big train station (Friedrichstrasse) 5 minutes walk.. with an elevator for strollers and wheelchairs. From that station, you can get pretty much anywhere. It is one stop out from the Berlin Hauptbahnhof. I always read these reviews before booking travel, yet this is the first review I have written.
