One of the front desk men John, actually took me on a sorty to a local park where he and his fellow \"Birders\" showed me some local wildlife while they photographed them for local magazines. Now, if that is not going out of their way to show a international traveller how to enjoy the local community, then I don't know how they could have topped that. Well done John and thankyou to the other helpfully members of the Days staff. The room was good and the oportunity to enjoy a nice restaurant was also within the building. I slept really well while at this hotel and enjoyed some good television in a pleasant room with a good view out the window of the parklands across the road.

The staff was very friendly. Maybe a little brief, and quick, but that may just be a Southerner's experience in Boston. The hotel itself looked relatively old, and not in the charming, historic, Boston way. It was obvious once I was inside that this wasn't just on the outside. The room was definitely older, but very clean, with \"upgraded\" shampoo and lotion. The New England coffee (roasted in MA) was also a nice touch, especially for tourists, although you can only do so much with a pre-packaged bag of ground coffee. There were maybe 15 channels on the TV, including HBO, and free wi-fi in the room. My room (two doubles) also had a desk and three chairs. The bed was relatively firm, although not uncomfortable, and there was a thermostat that controlled the heat, but not the A/C. The fan in the exhaust duct rattled during startup and shutdown, but otherwise wasn't too loud. I had a room that was adjacent to Soldiers Field Rd., and you could hear cars passing by pretty easily when the heater wasn't on. If you're a light sleeper, or if you were trying to sleep during off hours, I could see that being a problem. Additionally, there is a Chinese restaurant downstairs that smelled good and appeared popular with the local Asian crowd, even on Tuesday night, but I didn't go in. Other Miscellaneous Information: The hotel backs up to Western Ave., which can be useful if you're walking or busing it. For the frugal, there are several bus routes there (70,86) that will take you into Cambridge, to Harvard, and to the Red Line. There are a few Zipcars within walking distance as well.

Just to avoid any confusion! I stayed at this Hotel on April 24, 2008. I took my dad to see a Red Sox game and needed to find a reasonable place to sleep. I couldn't afford a $300 a night hotel in Downtown after paying $200 for Sox tickets! I don't really care about frills, all I look for is cleanliness and a safe neighborhood. The front desk was very nice and they let us check-in early. The total cost for one night was $123.00 for two double beds including tax. I realize I rated the Days as \"Excellent\", and it was, for what it was needed for, to sleep. I can't comment on much else except the room as that's all I used the Hotel for, but the room was clean. I thoroughly inspected my sheets before climbing into bed! The bathroom was dated but clean. Very basic amenities; TV, phone, toiletries, hair dryer and a coffee maker. It is located in Allston-Brighton about 3 miles from the heart of Boston. So, you shouldn't be surprised that its far out, a simple Mapquest of the address will tell you just how far it is. The distance didn't bother me because I had a car which I took and parked in Downtown the next day. The Hotel parking is free, something you don't get in a lot of Downtown Boston Hotels. We did, however, take a cab to Fenway because it was easier to do so. Parking can cost upwards of $30 and driving to Fenway on game day can be a hassle, the cab cost $16 each way (not including tip). The neighborhood is very sparse, but the Hotel felt safe and I felt ok leaving my car parked in their covered lot. I saw a bus stop right across the street from the Hotel, I can't be sure, but perhaps it takes you to Downtown or at least the nearest T-stop.

Make no mistake - it is not a luxury lodging, nor does it represent itself to be, and the location is, well, rather weird. All of that being said, my room was clean, very spacious, and definitely doable for a night (or for that matter, maybe a few nights), and the $99 paid on Hotwire was a bargain compared to other options. I did not try the Chinese restaurant onsite, so I cannot comment on that, but in my opinion, for a \"budget\" lodging, the facility is in reasonably good shape, and if you don't get obsessed with little things (the banged up wood on the wardrobe/tv cabinet, the bathroom door that didn't match anything, or the illfitting ceiling time in the bathroom, this does make for a viable alternative to the nearby high priced lodgings.

On the map it appears as if the street is continuous, however, in reality, the street is intersected by an overpass which requires cutting left, then right, then left. If you miss the change, which is easy, because the not all the streets are labelled, you wind up getting very lost. Some streets are triangular or curve leading to a dead end. The best way to get to his hotel is to drive to the far west end of Western Avenue and approach through the back parking lot. The hotel is located in a sort of \"urban blight region\". The front of the hotel faces the river, but the back is an old shopping mall and a light industrial zoning area. The parking lot is open to the the industrial area to the back so it gave me some pause about parking my car in the hotel parking area. Staff is very professional. Our room was extremely well cleaned and tidy. The condition of the room was somewhat worn but not atypical for Day's Inns. Mass transit access is actually by local bus. This might be convenient on the weekdays during work hours when the frequency is good, but on the weekends, it involves waiting at the bus stop for 20 to 60 minutes depending on how you time it. Walking to Cambridge from this hotel might be okay on a cooler day, but it was hot the day we stayed, and the path is essentially open \"side of freeway\" walking or walking through the backlots of industrial parks. I don't recommend this place to families because it doesn't feel safe. It's probably good for budget business travelers who don't mind using cabs, which are readily available at the front of the hotel. The money you might save on hotel fees and parking will be consumed by cab fare to and from the hotel.", "Date": "July 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cGreat nightly rate, but had security issues\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5048634", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel for 3 nights.

Certainly, you get what you pay for, and, being one of the only places (and certainly the cheapest one) in Boston where I could get free parking, I must say this hotel was what we were looking for, though not a particularly lovely place. The neighborhood, if you can call it that, is empty of people and warehouse-y, and though it's only a 15 minute walk to Harvard Square, it's not a walk we wanted to do at night. Soldiers Field Road is the road on the western side of the city that snakes along the Charles River, and as it heads east, it becomes Storrow Drive. The divided road can make the hotel tricky to get into if you're coming from the east, though, with its bright Days Inn sign, it's certainly easy enough to find. If you pay a little extra you can get a view toward the river, which is nice. The hotel has a covered parking lot which is a great convenience and keeps you out of the weather - the lot is under the back building, which gives it a creepy feeling at night. (However, we encountered nothing that gave us any reason to feel that way.) Also, the hotel has a restaurant, but we didn't eat there as it was always totally empty. Carpets look a little worn throughout, but the bed was okay. TV has many channels, bathrooms were clean, with decent shampoos, etc. If you want a cheap base of operations and need a free place to put your car, this is a good hotel to consider.

A most disappointing experience. First of all, according to hotels, the hotel was very close to Boston University, our main destination in Boston - maybe as the crow flies, but not for visitors using public transportation. The hotel is on a stretch of Soldiers Field Road that is not near anything but old warehouses and commercial enterprises like a skating rink and a tow truck outfit. In order to get anywhere in Boston or Cambridge, it's necessary to take the #86 bus from behind to the hotel to either the Harvard redline stop or the Cleveland Circle greenline stop. The staff at the front desk were woefully ignorant of the local public transportation system. When we inquired how to get to Boston College, they said we should take the 86 bus to Cleveland Circle, then take the greenline into Kenmore station, switch to the B line, and go back out to BC. A quick review of an MBTA map showed that that was completely idiotic - the #86 bus crosses the B line one stop from BC. The hotel staff would have had us going all the way into the city on one line and all the way out on another for no reason. The hotel room was OK - spacious enough and with comfortable beds, but the walls were paper thin and we could hear every sound emanating from the room next door. Our bathroom door didn't close at all, and the tub and bathroom fixtures were stained and in need of repair. Breakfast at the hotel was a disaster. Although there were only a total of perhaps 12 people in the dining room, we waited 20 minutes for someone to take our order, it took 45 minutes for the food to come, and we didn't get some things we had ordered. The waitress kept telling us \"it's a zoo here this morning!\" but there was no evidence of anything unusual at all. By the time we finished our meal, other customers were yelling at the manager and calling the service \"scandalous.\" I would never stay at this hotel again, and would not recommend that anyone do so.", "Date": "August 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cdon't plan on getting any sleep here!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "traveldiva23", "ReviewID": "UR2132652", "Content": "i stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and had no problems. however, i can't say the same about my stay this time. i was unable to get any sleep here and that is coming from someone who lives in manhattan! we were placed in the back part of the hotel. we overlooked the boston public works area which to say the least is an unpleasant view. even though it was the end of may the temperature dropped into the 30's at night. our room was freezing and the heat did not work. we called the front desk about it and they said they didn't know how the heat works or if it would be coming on but we could have some blankets. that was the least of our problems. as the night went on we could hear everything going on in the rooms next to us and in the hallway. we were kept up all night. people were in the hallways and slamming doors. to top it all off at 6am on sunday morning, we had tractors and dumptrucks working underneath our window at the boston works department although we were assured by the staff at the front desk when we checked in that our room was in a quiet location. we voiced our disatisfaction to the front desk and they were able to switch us into a room in the main part of the hotel where we had originally wanted a room. the walls were still thin but at least we didn't have to hear tractors and trucks. so if you are planning to stay at this hotel, request a room in the main part of the hotel. or better yet, stay somewhere else. there are plenty of other hotels in the boston area which have thicker walls and are in a quieter location.", "Date": "May 31, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reston, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cClean Rooms but Thin Walls\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1783438", "Content": "Pros: This hotel is reasonably priced, recently renovated, and situated close to Harvard with a view of the Charles River.

You can get a detailed map of the MBTA public transport system from the information kiosk at South station on the main concourse. Take metro to get on the red line (outbound direction Alewife) and take this up to either Central Square or Harvard Square. I only know the Harvard Square bus stop so I only describe that here. From Harvard Square follow directions for the no.86 bus, once outside need to go towards the park (towards a big sign Sheraton, in the distance) and be on that side of the road. There is a bus stop for 86 and 66 near some stone slabs which describe the history of Harvard Sq., further on is the park. The 86 is direction Cleveland Circle. The 86 bus will take you to the back entrance of the Days Hotel, ring the bell when Mcdonalds sign comes to view, you are on Western Avenue and the hotel is just to the right (~10 minute journey). You can walk through the carpark right through to Soldiers Field Rd, which has the nice view of the river. From Central Square you can catch the 70 or 70A.
