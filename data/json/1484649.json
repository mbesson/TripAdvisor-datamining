The studio was fine, very modern, clean, the space was well used. It was sufficient for 1 maybe 2 people max.

Once you arrive you should ask for a cable but you will only be able to use the internet at the desk. When it works its good, when it doesnt, it doesnt and i usually abandoned my computer for few hours. There is wifi in the lobby. I had some issues with cleaning. Sometimes i would be left with 4 towels, sometimes just two, sometimes there would be no bin bags in the bin. the electricity card would be taken out and laptop would go out of charge. Small things. The self service washing machine costs 6eur, you get a tablet/powder for it. Dryer is 3 Eur. It works on time so this buys you two hour use of each.The bed is big and comfy but the pillows are square and not great. I must admit the staff seems a bit not interested and wont go out of their way or anything but they are not rude.

Value-wise it is okay, but not a real bargain. First of all, the standard rooms are advertised as studio apartments with sleeping and living area - well it is a do-it-yourself \"living\" area, made possible through folding a foldaway bed and the placing pillows at the back of the cupboard. Speaking of the foldaway bed, it was uncomfortably hard with a foam mattress on a rudimentry statted frame not providing enough ventilation for a mattress of this kind. Sleeping quality was not good. Thirdly, though the kitchen was fully equipped, there was no coffee or tea provided for the guests. I asked if it was forgotten and was told that it is a self-catering hotel and that it has to be bought by the guests. I don't understand why for the cost of less than a Euro a day one would upset customers. Forthly, the staff was really kind and tried hard to be helpful, but every question we asked was answered with, \"wait a second, I'll google it for you\". It is okay for the most part, but when we asked how to get to the airport by public transportation we got the same answer. I would be amazed, if we were the first to ask this question. This hotel is rated as a 4 star hotel, well I am sure it meets all the criterias necessary, but it just doesn't feel like it. On the positive side, the small kitchen and the bathroom were very nice, even though the bathroom designer favoured fanciness over functionality, but okay.

The location was superb, not to far from Ku'damn and it's just fantastic. The room it self was nice. We love the size of the room. The bed was comfy and the kitchen functioned really nicely. We actually cooked lunch one time in the room and it was nice. They provided a computer at the lobby area and also a printer so it was easy for us to searched some info about the city and printed it out.

There is a building site next door, but we were allocated an apartment as far away from it as was possible (without us asking). It was very quiet and we were not bothered by any street noise or from the building site. The apartment was clean, well equiped, warm and comfortable. The nearest supermarket is only about 100 metres away. A bus stop to catch the 109/110 to the zoo, where the S Bann runs to take your quickly to all the sights was only a 5min stroll away and a U Bann station no more than a few minutes more. We bought a 72 hour Berlin Card from which we got the full value from the travel and discounts. As we bought one which covered Potsdam, we also used it to return to the airport. I would certainly recomment the Fat Tyres Bike tour. It took us to all the main sites on very easy to pedal bikes and our guide was very knowledgeable and funny. All the guides, I think, speak English as their first language, so you get a full commentary. I certainly don't think we would have covered the distance on one walking guided tour.

Hints such as it is located behind the Abba Hotel were helpful, although there are several signs on the road to indicate. We found the studio very stylish, clean and the furniture very versatile. (For example, there is table under the desk which can be used for dining, and the fold-up bed, which we found very comfortable, converted into a settee, making much more space for the day time.) There is plenty of storage space as well as an iron and ironing board and safe. The room was also very quiet, even though at one stage we had a 'Pavarotti' next door, who seemed to be rehearsing for Mozart's Titus! It sounded very good though - and it was midday! The kitchen has a large fridge, hot plates, dishwasher, kettle and combination microwave, although it would have limited use for grilling or baking as no metal trays very provided. Fine for reheating bought meals, though. As mentioned by others, it is impossible to use the shower without getting the floor wet. To this end a cloth or mop in the bathroom would have been appreciated. One previous reviewer mentioned he wasn't 'told' what to do with his rubbish. Cannot understand this problem as there are very clear signs saying 'Garbage', leading to a bin room at the end of the corridor - you don't even need to go outside. We found the location absolutely fine. The nearest U Bahn is approximately 5 minutes away, S Bahn just a little further. However, even nearer, there are very regular buses that go along the Ku'damm in the direction of the zoo. If you change there, you can catch the 100 or 200 bus which takes you to many of the tourist points. Public transport is relatively cheap and seemed very efficient. There are two supermarkets (Edeka and Kaiser) very close by. The staff were very efficient, professional and friendly. We also found it very convenient to leave our luggage on the final day in their secure luggage room. As well as the Apple computer terminal and printer in the lounge, there are also leaflets and guidebooks, newspapers and German magazines such as Stern, Focus and OK.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "American living in Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood room for the money, but a bit too far from the U-bahn\u201d", "Author": "paperfree", "ReviewID": "UR84728619", "Content": "I picked this hotel because it was reasonably close to the U-bahn line my husband needed to be on for work, it got good reviews on tripadvisor, and it was cheap. SERVICE: We arrived early but check-in time wasn't until 2pm so we left our bags in the luggage room and dozed on the sofa, then used their free wireless in the lobby (which worked well) to read up on Berlin. I thought they might yell at us for sleeping in their lobby but they didn't say a word. I was grateful because we were exhausted. By noon they found us a room (a studio). Check-out time is noon, but they let us keep our luggage in the (locked) luggage room all day, and called us a cab when we asked. Overall the service was efficient and professional. ROOM and BED: The apartment was very clean and modern looking. The bed was a Queen-sized fold-down bed, which some tripadvisor reviewers found too hard, but we liked it just fine. We never tried folding it up, but you would need to if you want to set up a dining table or sofa. I was expecting a slightly bigger room for an \"apartment hotel\" but it was big enough for us. I liked having a tea kettle, silverware, glasses, and a fridge, but we never tried cooking in the oven/microwave or on the two burner stove. NOISE and TEMPERATURE: The room was quite warm even without the heat on, but we just opened a window and the temperature was fine. There was construction going on outside our window, and although we could hear it once we woke up, it never interfered with our sleep. If you are a light sleeper you might inquire about it though--I suspect it will be going on for a while and could be louder in other rooms. (We were on the 5th floor.) MAID SERVICE: There was no maid service until check-out, which was fine with me. The floor did get a bit gritty since we weren't good about taking our shoes off. There was a vacuum in the closet if you wanted to clean the floor yourself. If you want maid service or clean towels you have to pay extra. They did give us free extra pillows though, after we asked. BATHROOM: The bathroom had a very nice modern shower with plenty of hot water and good pressure (but no bath). Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, the shower is open at the back so water leaks onto the floor. If you're careful, though, not too much water gets out. Just don't leave clothes on the floor when you're showering! The bathroom also had a nice magnifying mirror and a hair dryer. INTERNET: The lobby includes free wireless internet which works well. There's no wireless in the rooms though. The rooms includes free wired internet, however, and the front desk will give you a LAN cable if you ask, but it's quite short. You have to use your computer at the desk not the bed, and only one person can use it at a time. Also, every time you close the computer or leave the room (in which case you have to pull your room card and the power goes out), you have to re-log into their internet service, which is a bit annoying. But otherwise the internet worked fine. FOOD: We never tried the breakfast because other reviewers said it was overpriced. There are lots of cafes in the area though. FITNESS CENTER: The fitness center has a treadmill, an elliptical, and an exercise bike, but no weight machines. COST: 72 euros a night. Pretty cheap. LOCATION: The location was our least favorite aspect of the hotel. Although it looks close to several U-bahn stations on the map, once we were there we found them all a bit too far away. And the hotel is not close to any of the really big U-bahn stops that serve several lines. Maybe in the summer it would be fine but in the chilly October weather we wished we were more centrally located. OVERALL: If you're planning to stay in this area, the Adagio hotel is an excellent choice (except for the lack of wireless in the rooms). But next time we will probably prefer to stay in a different area.", "Date": "October 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires", "Title": "\u201cGood, nice and cheep (bueno, bonito y barato)\u201d", "Author": "ezini", "ReviewID": "UR83918655", "Content": "The staff is nice The appartments have whatever you need, but are small.

It opened in October 2009 and is situated one block away from KuDamm, which is awesome, considering it is in the heart of West Berlin\u2019s most vivid area, but some nice meters away from the big avenue. In fact, Adagio\u2019s front is not exactly on Lietzenburger Strasse; the hotel is rather situated adjacent to / behind Abba Hotel, overlooking the core of its city block. This, along with the sound proof windows, insures absolute silence inside the rooms yet leaving no chances for a nice view. The hotel extends to 6 floors, each having around 20 apartments, most of which are for 2 persons and the rest for 3-4 persons. We were a company of 3 and shared one of the bigger apartments for one week during Easter (April 2010). It comprised of virtually 2 rooms, one bedroom (twin beds, following our request) and one small living room with a comfortable sofa bed. These rooms were separated by a retractable door on the wall, offering the possibility to join or separate them at our will, just like a small suite. Each room had a telephone and an LCD TV mounted on the wall. In the living room, there was a desk and a wired Ethernet internet connection free of charge. There was also a small hi-fi system with speakers to be used as a radio, CD player or even plug your own usb stick with mp3s in it. The apartment also featured one stylish bathroom with a bathtub, a separate toilette room (WC) and a small but very well equipped kitchen, with a tall refrigerator, ceramic cooktop, microwave oven, complete set of dishes and glasses, even a dishwasher. You would also not need to bring your hair dryer with you, since there is one available, as well as an iron and ironing board. There is also an electronic safe for your things. We were pleasantly surprised by the modern and stylish furniture and finishing of the apartment and the hotel in general. It is evident that there has been put very good effort to the hotel\u2019s decoration and has been seamlessly combined with materials of good quality. Paying attention to the details, one is unlikely to find anything left to chance or thoughtlessly implemented. This surely applies also to the hotel lobby and breakfast room, with its modern and stylish design, which truthfully, matches the architectural taste of today\u2019s Berlin as a city. Breakfast was adequate; not bad but it could be better, since it lacked anything rememberable. Espresso coffee was not great either. Frankly, next time I visit this hotel, I think I\u2018ll choose between nearby coffee shops for my breakfast. Transportation wise, the hotel is ideally located. It may be between two metro stations, so you need about 10 min. to reach the nearest one, but you have a bus stop at 5 min. walk on KuDamm and believe me, buses are the best means of transportation in Berlin! They are frequent, there is no traffic whatsoever and you get to see the city on the move! One last note to potential visitors is that cleaning services are not offered as a standard in the apartment price. We stayed for a week and did not require any cleaning services, but if you do, you\u2019d better get more info straight from the hotel during your reservation.

They had not cleaned the room and there was someone elses dirty underwear and socks laying about. The floor was filthy and the bathroom was vile, hair in tub and dirt, was disgusting. After we complained they rightly moved us to another room. The 2nd room had at least been cleaned. The room was small but did our needs, the kitchen was handy as we often like to lie in and not be in a rush in the am and want to eat on our time not on the time of any restaurant. So we did use the kitchen, as other has said there was dishwasher, microwave with grill in it, nice size fridge. Pots/pans, tea kettle, coffee maker, stove top with 2 burners, dishes, silverware, even dish soap and tea towel. Bathroom was nice size as well and lovely shower. The bed however was like sleeping on a slab of concrete!! never ever in my life have I been on a harder then a rock bed then they have here. Most beds have a bit of give when you sit or lay on it...not this one..so if you like a stone hard bed then you will love this. As we are not late night people we do like to get early nights, the only english they have on tv is either news or sports...that's it. so take a book It's about 15 min walk to the U train station... There is a computer you can use in the downstairs lounge free of charge and wired internet in rooms that is free. We would stay again just b/c of the kitchen", "Date": "December 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cologne", "Title": "\u201cGreat accommodation on super location!\u201d", "Author": "paradaCologne", "ReviewID": "UR48545895", "Content": "This place gotta be very busy soon since it has everything you would need. I had an apartment ( 38sqm, they said but to me it was like 45sqm) with seperate living- and bedroom, a full kitchen and a good size bathroom with a very good showerhead. Two flat screen TVs with 80 european channels. It only takes 300 meters from the hotel to the 'Ku-Damm' and also to the bus station 109 or the U banh nr.9.
