It is certainly not a place to unwind after a long day sightseeing,no tea or coffee making facilities!! The TV channel is very limited,all the instructions were in Italian. we looked at ordering a pay for view film, when we enquired to see if we had the option to view them in English we were told by reception that they didn't know and that if we selected a film incorrectly we would still be charged the 9 euro rate!!! The air conditioning in the room didnt work so even in february and march the heat was uncomfortable!! The sauna had to be booked in advance so if after a long day you fancied chilling out,you may be disappointed if somebody else has beaten you to it!! Breakfast was basic and adequate!! On the whole if your an independent traveller in town for one night it's ok,but if like us your there for four nights seriously think again!!

There are lots of backstreet trattoria's which offer fantastic food for very good prices. The hotel was very clean and modern, and our room was very comfortable with a large powerful shower (always disappointed with hotel showers but not this one). We never made it to the sauna/Turkish bath unfortunately, we were always in the hot tub :) The only disappointment was that the hot tub wasn't working on the Sunday and they couldn't get anyone out to fix it until Monday, and we'd had a particularly busy day and were looking forward to a couple of hours in there to relax. The breakfast was adequate but don't expect the same as you would get in the UK in terms of the hot food - the sausages and bacon are not the same. There was a good selection of breads, fruit, pastries, cereals, yoghurts and cold meats and cheeses, and the scrambled eggs were fantastic. You won't go hungry.

So the key must always stay in the room if one person wants to go out; 2) that the toilet is about 2 feet from the bed. That's just too close for my comfort.

It was only a couple minutes walk from Termini station which was great for getting to/from the airport and the major sights.

Also the side of the wardrobe was hanging off - not what you expect in a 4 star hotel. See image. There was also a very clinical backlight above the bed which felt more like an asylum light than the warm light you would expect in a 4 star hotel room. Wi-Fi Thankfully the wif-fi service was free but nothing to write home about. The service is delivered via a code on the TV that is renewed every 4 hours so if you are a frequent user or dependent on wi-fi you will not appreciate having to renew your code every 4 hours. The download speed was around 5 MB/s with the upload speed no more than 1 mb/s at best. YouTube struggled to load but text-based websites were fine. The wi-fi was also monitored by the hotel. Breakfast Breakfast was perfunctory - self-service coffee machine. The maids did not greet us once but did offer to make a coffee as I was making my own which seemed a bit pointless. You get a range of typical breakfast meals - muesli, yoghurt, toast, sausages, croissants etc. The room resembles a cafeteria and didn't exude class or the feeling you were in a supposedly luxury hotel. On the Friday to Sunday the place was very busy and many could not even sit down. Reception Staff. Service was mixed. Some staff were friendly but others aloof and snobbish. One receptionist questioned my entrance into the hotel on my fourth day there even though I had spoken to her earlier. Because I was carrying cans of Fanta she assumed I didn't belong there. Cleaning Room was often not cleaned until the afternoons which was inconvenient. On two ocassions the room was cleaned late even though the sign was on the door requesting the service. Once the maid was opposite and saw us leave at 10am but when we came back at 1pm the room had not been cleaned. Taps in the bathroom were left uncleaned. Other services You had to book the sauna in advance for 45 minute solo sessions but no lockers or robes were provided so it meant sauna users had to walk thorough the reception in wet towels.

The guy changed us to the junior suite at no extra cost the very next day which was great. Would have liked and expected tea/coffee facilities in the room for a 4 star. Bar was never open. Breakfast was very disappointing and cramped- cappacino was good. Ideal place for location as all main attractions are walking distance, we only got the metro to the way to vatican city (walked on the way back). it cost 1 euro each and the station was visible from the hotel - good walking distance. Do not eat in the touristy areas and food is appalling - not authentic and very expensive. Go to the back streets of cavour street (where the roads continues but has a right turn (not far from termini station), and go across the water to traverese area - for \u00a310 got a three course authentic meal with quarter wine!!! do not but mineral water and there are foundations all over which have spring water running through them and is for drinking. For shopping the designer shops are on condetti rd (come off spanish steps and turn right or straight. the high street type of shops are on corso del - all close together where we had the best cappacino in a cafe.

We were shown to our room and it was very small, but not only that the bathroom was far from adequate. Everything felt like it was about to fall apart. The toilet jutted out from the wall with no base so when you sat on it it felt as though it was going to break, a larger person may have severe difficulties. When you took a shower it took about 15 minutes for the water to drain, so you are showering in dirty water, the bathroom sink looked as though it was about to fall apart. We were then told of a spa upstairs on the roof and a steam room and sauna. This was wonderful news as we had travelled quite far and needed to relax, I got into the spa and I have no idea what sort of water they used there but my skin tightened and and felt very uncomfortable, after this I walked down to the sauna only to have one of the male staff members hanging around and peering in through the window. This all seemed nothing to the welcoming response you get when you go down for breakfast in the morning. The older gentleman that runs the breakfast area is rude and disgusting to say the least. On our first morning we watched him crash plates, slam doors and talk very rudely to customers, on the second morning it was our turn. He yelled at us that the table we were trying to sit at was for 4 and not 2 , as there were no more tables we moved to another table only to be yelled at again, mind you this was in front of a lot of other guests, very embarrassing and not a great way to start your day.

There is a line A and line B which take you to every part of the city you need to go to. It is also set back from the station just enough so that you aren't disturbed by any noise in the evenings. When doing the sight seeing things it's definitely worthing latching onto a tour as for a few extra quid you get info about the place you're seeing and more importantly skip the massive queue's that are at each major attraction. Be weary of the gypsie's at the main metro stations, they eye up everyone's bag's and rucksacks as they wait on the platforms then as you're about to board they work as a team, using the mum's with babies as a decoy to raid the bags.

Basically, my partner and me are frequently travellers in quite many different countries who have at least a minimal tasty of choosing hotels. Althought we didn't book the 5 star hotel but both of us believe 4 stars hotel should be sufficient enough to have a fair holiday in Italy. We spent 2 nights staying ina splendid hotel in Venice prior to we go to Rome by taking air plane. Truly, splendid hotel left us quite a good impression. As we took the evening flight to Rome, it had been a little bit of late when the time we arrived to our hotel. The location of hotel is definitely close to terminal station, however, we didn't expect this hotel is a little bit of far from the main street. There had been some drunkers on the street when we tried to find out where is our \"4 star hotel.\" We tried to ask other people who are working in other three star hotels on the same street of our hotel. Eventually, we found out that our hotel is behind many 2 or 3 star hotels after we went through the street which looks quite doggy at night. When arriving, there was no door-conciage coming out to help us carry any of our luggage (Fortunatelly, I can manage to carry our two small-size suite cases to go up stairs as you can see in the their pictures). I have to say that at least there were doormen in the Splendid hotel. I was a little bit of surprise that the staff in the night shift didn't wear any uniform of their hotel. The other guy did wear but he couldn't even speak English. We still gave the unhelpful non-english speaking guy the tips as we treat other hotel staffs as same. Then, we were given a standerd room (which means the smallest room in the hotel). There was a tricky thing that we paid two people but we only get a SINGLE double bed room. When we firstly came inside the room, both of us were stunned by the size of room and their model design of room layout. The shower and toilet are behind of the bed and even the textile of shower tub looks quite dirty because they use the un-revamped stone as a kind of rennovated design. As my partner is sensitive of the air in the room, we tried to open the heater up, so the room air can recycle again. However, the control panal of central air condition seems not work properly. There were no any air coming out from the fan exit. We thought that their central air condition system must be broken up. Both of us were quite upset because we had arriaved lately and only wanted to go to bed after taking a warm shower. We eventually went down to ask the inconsistant staff to change the other room for us because we really felt suffocation in a non-air room. He gave us the other room in which the shower and toilet are set in the normal way. Despite we had tested whether the air condition (heater) works properly, we ultimately gave up and open the window to let fresh air come into our room. As other reviewer said, the interior of hotel actually looks quite IKEA-Y, you can tell the material of decoration is quite cheapy, you can tell that the wood-like furnitures are really surpirse you that they can be rated as a 4 stars hotel. The most rudeness thing is that there were one woman treating us as the second class customer when we went down to eat our breakfast at second morning. We console ourselves that theiir staffs were on holiday during Christmas so they changed their staffs every day, even the people working in the kitchen. The woman seemed not want to serve us coffee after my partner asked her to do so because my partner saw her asked other customers coming down later than us. I didn't notice because normally I don' any habit to drink coffee in the morning. However, that woman even didn't say any sorry to us after we found out her own misbehaviour. My partner was quite upset after we joined the tourist bus to going around the city because we saw many same 4 stars hotels are located in a good area and outstanding lounge and beautiful design which is much better than our IKea-y hotel. The other ridiculous thing is the last morning prior to we leave this hotel. The clearner maidress went into our room to clean when we set up the \"Don't disturb light outiside the door\" We really felt quite unsecurity when we forgot to leave our some valuable things on the table. It really makes us feel quite nervous. They absolutely were merely 2 stars hotel or less because after we checked out to leave our two luggages to their reception and the front desk guy even didn't give us any ticket to reserve our lugguage in their luggage room which means any one could take away our luggages or put any unsafe items inside our suitecases.

When I asked if there was anywhere nearer (which I knew there would be, as I've been to Rome several times), I was advised that the area we were going to is particularly good for dining and the restaurant recommended wouldn't disappoint. After eventually finding the restaurant - again in quite a 'choicy' street - it had MTV playing on a big screen and was not an authentic Italian restaurant at all!

The sites in Rome are very impressive but I was a little disappointed as the area seems to have gone down hill since my last visit 4 years ago & there is certainly a lot more graffiti everywhere.

The desk clerk at the Morgana Royal Court stated they had a \"problem\" with another guest and did not have a room for me but don\u2019t worry we booked you in another hotel right around the corner. I was leery but she said it was a \"four star\" hotel (The Venetia Palace). After trudging to the new hotel, in the rain, I was forced to wait in the lobby for over an hour while they prepared my room. I was unable to book a tour for my last night in Rome because of this delay. Finally I was able to enter my room, which I thought smelled musty, but since it was already so late I just left my things in the room before leaving, trying to salvage something of my evening. When I returned later that night, after dinner, I discovered that the carpet in the entire room was WET, not damp but soaking wet. At this point I was so tired, and it was so late that I did not want to go through the hassle of changing rooms since I was leaving very early in the morning to catch my plane. I discovered the next morning that the shower did not drain properly and was most likely the reason for the wet floor. Upon check out I told the desk clerk that the floor was wet and the shower did not drain, all he said was Si Si, we know. What kind of hotel knowingly puts guests in rooms with wet carpet?? I did not originally choose to stay at this hotel and I can assure you that I will NEVER stay there again on any future trips to Rome!", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWell located, comfortable hotel, fantastic staff - I will return!\u201d", "Author": "Craigycraig", "ReviewID": "UR42216512", "Content": "Stayed here for 7 nights with my partner, at the end of August / beginning of September, and I would love to return. Location The location was great for us, being as it is, a very short walk from the main train station, which made travel to / from the airport easy (direct train from the Airport to Station). The station has an underground shopping mall, with a good sized super market, ideal for picking up Peroni at sensible prices! In addition, the station's underground / tube station is ideal if you'd rather not walk everywhere, and you can easy get a tube to sights such as Coliseum, Spanish Steps, Vatican etc. A friend who had lived in Rome for 4 years, had mentioned to me, that the area around the station was not the most desirable, however we were coming & going at all times of day & night, and didn't feel threatened / scared at all. Indeed, the area around the hotel seemed much nicer than the areas around the other side of the station, and I'm hard pressed to think of many cities where the areas around stations are glamorous. Staff The reception staff are amazing, especially Marco and Mihaela, who were very efficient, friendly, and helpful. On a direct flight from Gatwick, BA managed to lose both our bags, and Marco and Mihaela helped us lots, especially when trying to get in contact with BA's representatives in Italy. Over the years, I've stayed in many hotels, and both Marco and Mihaela must be among the most friendly and helpful I've ever encountered, and are a credit to the hotel. The breakfast waiter was great too, as my partner has a preference for espresso's, which the waiter went out his way to make fresh for him each morning. Room The rooms do seem to be a bit on the small side, and are somewhat minimalistic. That said, it was by no means the smallest hotel room I've ever slept in, and I guess you're not going to visit Rome and then spend all day in your room. We were lucky enough to be on the 5th floor, and we had a balcony, which was great, as it was a fab place to sit out in and relax after being out all day, and a great place to sit first thing in the morning (before it got too hot). The bathroom was a bit strange, with almost see through glass doors in the bathroom (doesn't leave much to the imagination), and whilst the bathroom was very smart / clean / trendy, it's probable not the most practical. The air con was invaluable, as it was soooooo hot when we visited, and I'm not a great fan of the sun / heat, and it worked a treat, cooling the room to a more comfortable level. The hotel had a small gym too, which seemed well enough equipped for a hotel gym, although I never did try it out, and it also was great to find a hot tub on the roof, which was such a bonus, and a great way to unwind after a hard days walking. Breakfast Food / breakfast can often be a contentious area. You will be disappointed if you're used to / are expecting a large breakfast area with chiefs a plenty standing around cooking your eggs to perfection, however I found the breakfast to be more than adequate, and on a couple of days enjoyed breakfast outside on the small patio area. The breakfast was self service, and consisted of a good selection of cold meats, scrambled eggs, cheese, and numerous cakes / pastries, as well as cereals, fresh fruit and yoghurt - you can't really ask for more, and the breakfast pretty much kept us going all day, especially with all the walking / sightseeing we did. Overall The hotel / bar / rooms are indeed small / minimalistic, especially when compared to other western hotels, however the great central location, the fantastic staff, the lovely room with balcony, and of course, the hot tub on the roof, make this place a little gem, a superb place to stay, and a hotel that I'd love to visit again, and I hope I do soon!", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cawful breakfast ok hotel\u201d", "Author": "traveltortoise", "ReviewID": "UR39346821", "Content": "probably the worst breakfast I have ever had in a hotel anywhere in the world.

Seamless check-in from a serious, but pleasant enough chap, room 302. The room was spotlessly clean with minimalist furniture and fittings - good level of comfort and decent TV and free Wi-Fi. Nice Jacuzzi bath if you like that sort of thing. Jacuzzi on 6th floor - nice touch although quite cozy if more than a couple of users at any one time - definately worth a try.

There are certainly more upscale, gentrified areas of town, but this one is safe enough and conveniently located near the main terminal, from where you can go anywhere in Rome or Italy. I wouldn\u2019t have stayed anywhere else (but I\u2019m also a 6\u20198\u201d male who was running the Rome Marathon, so I\u2019m less likely to feel threatened, I suppose). As for the hotel itself, the Venetia Palace is superb. I arrived hours early and was helped by the delightful Mihaela, a Romanian woman with an impeccable grasp of the English language (during my stay I found all of the staff to be fluent in English). Despite being early, my room had already been prepared and I was allowed in\u2014I was staying in a double room meant for single use, and was honestly surprised at the amenities and room. First, the bedroom; at $105 a night (off Expedia) I got the equivalency of a queen sized bed (two doubles pushed together), a decent-sized flat screen TV (20 or 27\u201d\u2014I\u2019m not really sure), desk, stationary, a closet cabinet, safe, phone, free wi-fi, minibar, and a room spacious enough for me (but others may need more room. I live in a very tiny apartment, so I'm used to staying in a single room with a bathroom--it was like being home). The room was kept very clean and had turnover service each day. In order to power any and every thing in the room, it was necessary to leave your key card in a little slot by the door\u2014an interesting detail I also found at the Albergotto, my hotel in Florence. I wish I\u2019d taken a photo of the room now, but I was more interested in the bathroom at the time\u2014I guess because it was my first time out of the country and Eurobathrooms are pretty different. The bathroom had a full toilet (seat too! Thank god!), toilet paper, bidet, bathtub/Jacuzzi/shower combo, towel radiator (a common amenity I found in all of my hotels and which came in quite handy during my final day in Venice), and large sink with a plethora of different-sized towels underneath it. Simply put, it was an impressive room. Having never used a European shower before, I burned and froze myself a few times before figuring out the top knob turned the water on while the bottom one adjusted the heat of it. The shower head in the Venetia Palace hotel was stationary and sprayed jets of water down which could sometimes be painful\u2014usually only if you tried to wash your face. Imagine having big angry bolts of water being thrust at your eyeballs and you\u2019ll see what I mean. The breakfast the hotel offered was amazing. It had eggs, bacon, several kinds of bread, delicious croissant-pastries, three kinds of cereal, fruits, coffee, tea, orange juice, yogurt, and water. I couldn\u2019t ask for more\u2014especially considering how awful American hotel breakfasts usually are. The hotel also had a Turkish bath/sauna, gym (which I used every morning), and meeting rooms. Although the gym is not all-encompassing, I found the precor unit very useful in keeping with my daily fitness, and really appreciated its existence. My routine in Rome was this: wake up around 10 or 11, go see some ruins/museums, eat around 6 or 7, take a nap until about 10:30, then go down to Campo dei Fiori, the American bar hotspot, and party until 2 in the morning. The staff of the Venetia Palace lock the door to the hotel sometime after midnight, but there was always somebody waiting at reception to let me in, no matter how late I arrived back (and believe me\u2014I came back LATE some nights! One time at 3:45!). After a few days I fell in love with Rome and decided to cancel my 2-day plans for Naples/Capri for 2 more days in Rome, and the hotel was happy to extend my stay with no problems. They stored my luggage until I left for Florence at six on my final day in Rome, and were very warm and welcoming during my entire stay. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anybody looking for a place to stay in Rome\u2014it\u2019s a definite gem in the Termini section of town, and is pretty cheap by Euro-hotel standards!", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "devon", "Title": "\u201cbrilliant hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "devonian81", "ReviewID": "UR25152112", "Content": "stayed here for 4 nights - room was brillant! location - 5 mins walk from the main termini/metro and 20mins to the coleseum. breakfast - everything you could want - bread, cheese, ham, ceral , fruit, eggs, coffee, juice, yoghurt.", "Date": "February 25, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Venetia Palace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d1192136-Reviews-Venetia_Palace_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$158 - $301*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Marghera 47/A</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1192136", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/93/84/938431f8876b7f9d55a75bc40c5d56528large.jpg"}}
