We had a comfortable room, which was spotless. The breakfast was also good, and there was a wide selection of both hot and cold food. Crucially, this time, our bill was correct, and we were able to settle it quickly, and with no fuss! - This really did make a huge difference; having no \"hassle\" on our last day. From a Customer Service point of view, I would also mention that as the last day of our stay coincided with a Train Crash that closed the railway line to the Airport, the staff were very helpful in helping us with other options.

The service exceeded my expectations. Every time I asked for a recommendation for a restaurant, I was sent to a little gem that perfectly suited my needs that night. Contrary to reviewers who mentioned the size of the room as a negative point, my room was spacious. As I had planned to bring my laptop and do some work, I had booked a business suite, and it was a wise decision. The WiFi/Internet connection was very good. My room, located on the 5th floor was very clean, with plenty of windows that you can open to get some fresh air, quiet and super comfortable. Attention to details is what made my \"temporary home\" feel so cozy: scented votive candles in the bathroom, complimentary bottles of water, towel heating rack, good quality toiletries, etc. After a tiring flight from oversea, I was delighted with the fresh fruit tray delivered to my room shortly after my arrival. As a solo woman traveler, I also felt very safe in the neighbourhood, and at the hotel. For those who need access to a computer, the business centre has great computers with excellent internet connection.

I made use of the small hotel gym on two days, which was basic but modern and clean. The communal areas are a very high standard, though the room was a little dated - I assume it was one which hasn't yet been renovated, but it was large and absolutely fine. Breakfast in the attached restaurant was very good. EUR50 for 5 days wifi is outrageous and I find the management response that a hotel of this size cannot justify its own internet service rather feeble. Luckily, I was able to pick up a local free wifi hotspot and avoid this charge!! With regards to the location, it was perfect for commuting as was a 5 min walk to Centraal station, which I needed to get to every morning. However, whilst being as central as you can get, the main road Damrak which the hotel is on is rather grotty. Coming back late one night, there were some very undesirable people on Dam Square, adjacent to the hotel. This is probably what you should expect of a big city, though.

The hotel is at a very convenient location, right at Dam Square. One could even walk up to the hotel from the Amsterdam Centraal Station, its like a 5min walk. So on arrival, I had my reservation in place. I asked for an upgrade, and I was upgraded to a suite at a very attractive price. The suite was awesome. A very large room with the front window looking into Dam Square. The rooms have a Nespresso machine, and for a coffee lover like me, that was very good. The staff were mostly very helpful and courteous and guided me whenever I needed help. One weird thing happened because of which I rate the hotel as 3/5 and not 5/5. On one of the nights when I got back to the hotel at around 2.00am (tired and a little high), my room access key would not work. Its the same key which one needs to use to activate the elevator as well. The person at the front desk checked on their system and said that I had to clear the payment for the room service, internet, etc etc for the room key to be activated, as the system had blocked my room entry card. I found that very very strange, because all this would be cleared at the time of checkout anyway, so why stop a guest at 2.00am. Anyway, I was very tired and sleepy, and just handed over my card to be swiped. I was told that this is just a blocked amount and will be credited back to my card when I make the full payment on my checkout. Next day at check out I informed the front desk manager about what had happened the previous night, and he did apologize to me. So, I made the balance payment, and was reassured that the blocked amount on my credit card that I had handed over the previous night would be re-credited to my card. Its been more than 1 week, and this has not happened as yet. This is also the reason why I have waited for a week before sharing my review here. Overall the stay was good, staff mostly courteous, but that one incident was quite a letdown, especially if you stop a guest in the middle of the night. Moreover, the blocked amount has not been re-credited as yet. I did send out an email to the hotel yesterday, but haven't heard back as yet. I would definitely recommend the hotel to everyone for its location, nice rooms, and the mostly courteous staff. But it would be great on the hotel's part to rectify their room-management system as its impolite to stop a guest in the middle of the night for whatever reasons. All balance payments can be cleared at the time of checkout. This is my point of view, the hotel may differ on this, but I believe that all readers should know about this.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel\u201d", "Author": "bobstuff", "ReviewID": "UR122301792", "Content": "My wife and I recently spent 10 nights at the Swissotel in Amsterdam.

It was my first time staying at this hotel and my first time visiting this city. The location can't be beat, it is right smack in the middle of the city and only about a 10 minute walk from the train station (which is about a 30 minute ride from the airport). From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, the employees at this hotel made us feel very welcome and displayed the highest level of service! Forgive me, but I am horrible at remembering names, but everyone we encountered were a delight and a credit to Swissotel. The breakfast was very good and tasty. The service was flawless. I appreciated the buffet setup as I could choose what I wanted to eat, rather than being given a set-plate. The only thing I would recommend to the staff is the juice and milk were simply set out and not kept cold. I would think that would be a health and safety issue being that we are dealing with dairy products. I did not drink the milk as I did not want to take the chance of drinking spoilt milk. But other than that, the food was great and kept warm! As for our room, I am not a fan of hardwood floors, especially in the cold weather, but thats what slippers are for. The bed was quite comfortable, the chairs seemed a bit small and very 'doll-house' like. The TV seemed to be from the 1990s and only 13 inches? This made it very difficult to watch while laying in bed relaxing. Perhaps getting TV sets from this century (example, flat-screen/flat panel and definitly at least 20 inches if not more) would be a smart business decision. Nonetheless, our room was very nice. The espresso machine was much appreciated and made some of the most delicious coffee ever! Oh, and before I forget, let me thank the housekeeper who provided me with a kettle to heat up some water to take my 'hot medicine' to help with my cold. She said it would be much easier than using the espresso machine for just hot water.

However, due to a really good price for a \"Premier\" room, with inclusive WiFi, we booked this hotel via a tour operator (British Airways, who we use regularly) On arrival, we got to our room to find that it was on the small side, especially the bathroom, which was tiny (so small, that the toilet roll holder was jammed against the towel rail, and didnt work!). After complaining at reception, the receptionist confirmed that we had one of the smallest rooms, and we were offered a larger room, but told we could only move the next day, as the hotel was full. So we re-packed the next morning, and went to reception, only to be told (by someone else) that we already had a big room, there were no other rooms, but that we could upgrade for E100 per night (no thanks!). So back we went to our original room..... On asking about the inclusive Wifi, we were told that it has not been included, but that they would charge it to us, and remove it from our bill at the end of the stay Having requested a late check out on Sunday (at NH Hotels, this runs until 1700hrs, and is free), we were then told (grudgingly) that we could have until 1300 free, and then we would be charged E20 per hour! So having decided to check out at 1300, came the best bit! - The Hotel tried to charge us once again for the whole cost of the weekend (500E), despite us having given them a PrePaid Voucher, and them telling us on check-in that our credit card was \"For Extras Only\". We then had to phone the 24 hour BA Helpline, who (Thank God!) confirmed to the Hotel that we had paid, and sent them an email, so that we could leave! In fairness to the Duty Manager on Sunday, he did his best to help us, and was far more interested than the staff we dealt with earlier in the weekend As you can see from our other reviews, we tend to mark quite highly, but I can honestly say that this was the worst service we have ever received. Had we been urgently getting a flight, the check out experience would have been even more stressful than it was So if you stay here via a tour operator, make sure that you print off your vouchers - I am so glad we did!

All of the people who participate in the hotel are friendly and helpful, satisfiable stay is always guaranteed. However I do not want to recommend the hotel to others, because I'm not happy if so many people want to stay at the hotel and it gets difficult to make a reservation ;-) Please keep a room available for my next trip! ...

It also has many trams stopping right in front of its entrance and a 10-15 min walk away from Amsterdam Centraal station, The staff are almost always responsive and willing to help with queries. Kudos to the two hotel managers Albert and Maudy for making our stay memorable. There was, however, a late development that runied our stay. On our second night we realised that one of our suitcases was broken into. The suitcase was found in a strange position, and the zip was pried open, almost unnoticeably. Some foreign currency was lost (we were lucky that we took all the Euros with us on that particular day). We reported it to the Hotel Manager but he couldn't trace the perpetuator after checking all the room access timings. Since it was highly unlikely that an outsider entered our room without any security access, we assumed that it was probably an inside job (but not jumping to conclusions as to who did it). The perpetuator probably did it many times with other guests without them even noticing that their part of their cash is gone. To the Hotel Manager's credit, he upgraded us to the Junior Suite on the last night and instructed housekeeping not to enter our room.

The streets of Amsterdam are not the safest place to be after midnight, but the hotel kept the lobby doors locked at night and required a room key to enter. This is not a knock on the location, just the reality of Amsterdam.. Lots of shady people trying to sell you hard drugs are looming the city streets at night. The room itself was large for European standards and very clean. We had an amazing view of square and there were no complaints about the quality.

We went to the establishment connected to the hotel for this breakfast. When we went to check out, we found out that the buffet was somehow not what was included and had a bill for 70 American Dollars. Yikes.

It was obvious that there was building work going on, one of the lifts is out of order however, I wasn't notified of this prior to arrival which would have been nice. Having said that, I'm not against building work being carried out during the day (It does have to happen at some point after all), and I would still have kept my reservation. The room was very well presented (see pics on their website), lovely bathroom with glass sliding doors between it and the suite, the bed was enormous and extremely comfortable. Unfortunately there was also building work being carried out in a maintenance room next door to the suite (again this is just one of those things). Due to this, my partner and I decided to go out for a look around Amsterdam where we realised how excellent the location is. As noted in previous posts, the hotel is right in the middle of everything!

After then going out to dinner we returned to find the room a little warm and so switched the air conditioning on before going to bed, however, around 03:00 woke up to find the room incredibly hot. On checking the air con, the fan seemed to be working but the thermostat did not? In the end we settled for opening the window which cooled the room down but due to the location was quite noisy so unfortunately from that point on we didn't get a lot of sleep. Unfortunately, the building work re-started again around 08:00 in the room next door with some kind of cutting taking place which filled the room with a burning smell. Since we were checking out, we checked out early and noted our concerns with regards the air conditioning and the burning smell to the front desk who assured us something would be done. (The burning smells lay solely with the builders rather than the hotel as I'm sure this kind of cutting requires proper ventilation to be conducted).

On arrival at the hotel we were presented with refreshing hot towels while the receptionist proceeded to check us in. The receptionist was particularly professional and helpful. He inquired if we had visited Amsterdam before and when we mentioned it was our first visit, he produced a map and some guidance to getting around the city which was very gratefully received. The location is ideal just on Dam Square with access to tram stops just outside and behind the hotel. The room I had reserved was a twin and was quite small but was adequate for our needs. The welcome snack of a fresh apple each left in the room was appreciated and was, in my opinion a defining touch as many hotels do not provide this level of thoughtfulness. The beds were incredibly soft and unfortuantely not to my companions taste as she prefers a harder mattress, but I found the mattress to be very nice. The pillows however are probably far to soft for my particular preference. The facilities provided are the usual, coffee and tea making, mini bar which was left empty for our personal use, which I prefer. The bathroom is fine, the shower pressure was perfect. However if I do have any negative criticisms it is of the restaurant attached to the hotel, which I am very aware is not affiliated to the hotel, but is over priced and incredibly disappointing in both service levels and quality of food served. We had the misfortune to go for breakfast there one morning and I regret it wholeheartedly. Inferior food, slow almost grudging service and the prices were astronomical for the rubbish we were served. My advice is to steer very well clear of the Dam Plaza Restaurant. Also on our way home on the last night we wanted a couple of bottles of water which cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.50 at the bar in the resturant. Absolutely incredible! My suggestion is for the hotel to provide a couple of bottles of drinking water for their guests - build it into the price of the room, but don't leave it for the guests to be ripped off in that restaurant, which its fair to say would colour any recommendations I would have to make about the Swissotel. Unfortunately there was some noise pollution in the form of drilling while the hotel renovates their new lift, but it wasn't unbearable. And be sure to put the do not disturn sign on the door, I forgot and the eager housekeeping staff entered the room while I was still in bed at 9.30am on Sunday morning! Its one way to get me up out of bed at least.

On the minus side I would mention the needlessly enormous bed that occupied too much room space, the too narrow bathtub and specially its very high edge that makes really difficult (and even dangerous for short or aged people) to get in and out. But the main disappointment was that our \"classic\" room was too far from what you can see in the hotel web site: the window was very small and placed in a recessed corner, opening to an also recessed corner at the very bottom of an inner courtyard, so we didn't have any day light at all: we were forced to permanently have the lights on, so after a couple of days we already felt really claustrophobic, but a comment to reception got only a \"yes, I understand\" and a \"I'm really sorry\" very polite answer.

Nothing wrong with it though. Staff is very adequate and friendly. My room is not huge (again not as big as its Asian peers, but hey, this is medieval Europe). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s obviously been refurbished only recently. Nice decorum. Very clean, that is till we took over. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been bloody hot in Amsterdam over the weekend so thank God for the airco. Need to keep the windows shut to make it work though, but frankly keeping the windows open isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really an option in this part of town; you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get more downtown than this. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a constant rush hour going on outside, although it gets less noisy after 11pm. Could go for a room at the back of the hotel of course but then you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d miss the view, which is really amazing. Actually the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pretty quiet with the windows shut. To say the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in a good location would be an understatement. This is A+ prime spot we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about, right at Dam Square, which is the Amsterdam equivalent to, well let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s say Time Square or Piccadilly Circus. Kinda expected internet to be included in the rate these days but it certainly isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bring my notebook anyway so this is actually even better. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a gym next to the business centre, which is quite large given the size of the hotel. Not planning to use it though; I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on holiday! Breakfast is okay but at 20 Euro a little expensive to my opinion. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like a breakfast eatery on every street corner in this part of town offering far better deals. Sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to tell why you like a hotel. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s really nothing spectacular about this place. Still when you enter the building everything feels right. Kudos to the people at reception, they certainly added zest to our stay.

Very central or within a short walk (10-15mins) of most other places of interest. There are regular trams that stop nearby. The reception and welcome was fine. Then the problems started. I had booked a twin room - the room was intimate (small) - 121. You could not open the bathroom door if the room door was open or if anybody was standing at the door: I was away with a group of friends. The twin beds were joined together so we had to do a bit of re-arranging the furniture to separate the beds and relocate the night stand. The floor underneath the bed was ffilthy. The view was of a side wall of another building maybe about 5-6 away. The room was dark. We unpacked and then met up with one of our group who said our room was like a suite compared to their \"shoe box\". His room was even smaller (128). The three of us decided to go to the bar for a drink: we ordered 3 large Heineken beers and they were delivered promptly together with a bowl of nuts. We joked about the size of the rooms then we saw the mice. YES the mice. Two of them joyfully playing running around under the table about 15 feet away. This was in the bar/breakfast /dining area:beside the kitchen. I reported it. Oh my God. The Dutch may be laid back but they were not too fussed about these rodents. Eventually a bar man went into the kitchen and came out wearing gloves and looked around the area that I had pointed out. The beer was quickly finished and we left. No explanation no comment no report. It struck me that we may not have been the first to report this. Our deal did not include breakfast so we did not go back to this area. We did not have another drink in the hotel. The room was quiet because it was not to the front of the hotel but was very warm so we opened the window which allowed every noise in.

Whilst I did feel that in general the staff tried to be polite and said the right things - they were less than adequate when things went wrong - polite but totally unhelpful. I arrived in the evening and was put in a room that was incredibly noisy on the 1st floor. It was also extremely hot even though the windows were open (the heating system seems to be faulty in some rooms) - I had to close the window because of the street noise, and went immediately to ask reception for another room due to the noise. They said they were full - I went back to the interenet and tried to book another room of the same price - there was availability - at the least, they had nicer rooms available I discovered the next day. That night I struggled to sleep between the noise and the heat - I used earplugs. The next night the heat was so bad, and I could not open the windows. The air conditioning was broken - they must have known this which is why the windows were open when I arrived. So I was in an incredibly loud room (on the street), with a faulty heating system that just kept heating it to get hotter and hotter. I called an attendant just before 6am to try and sort it - he said there seemed to be a problem with 3 other rooms - this was the 4th now - (I later discovered there were more). There was nothing he could do but bring me a ridiculously large and roaring fan that was worse than the noise outside. He said to speak to the manager the next day. I finally fell asleep at around 6.30am and woke at 11. I spoke to the manager. She was polite but offered no compensation for my two nights of poor sleep. No upgrade, no free breakfast (after I slept through breakfast), just a half bottle of wine and some chips appeared in my room I noticed. She simply moved me to another room and checked that I was okay with it. I said yes - it was the same size - facing a brick wall. I opened the window, this time to be greeted to the noise of a loud boiler, and guess what, the air conditioning in this room wasn't working either - it boiled up. I only had one more night so grinned and beared it. The room service food was very average for the price (though not extotionate) - the pasta was poor, the sirloin adequate though a little burnt for medium rare - the portions were always too small though. The worst was when I phoned during the night menu and got through to reception (who double as room service it seems) to be told there was no ice cream left- so I had a cup of soup - he seemed a little curt that I had asked for food past 22:30 at night (though the late night menu is on display). I only did this because my original meal was not big enough - and I am not a big eater. The location is excellent and so is the business centre. The staff are generally very pleasant - but alas my stay here was unpleasant due to the faulty heating systems and noise of the hotel. This could have been amended with some sort of compensation or sincere apology - neither came (nor was asked for) - I have a slight gut instinct with this, perhaps I'm wrong, but I do not think this hotel cared too much for me because I am in my mid twenties - maybe if I was older with a family - they would have compensated or done something to make up for putting me in a totally uninhabitable room for two out of my three night stay.", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul,Turkey", "Title": "\u201cIn the middle of everything,impressive staff caring all your needs\u201d", "Author": "luxury06", "ReviewID": "UR54583928", "Content": "We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights.

My partner and I made our 2d trip to Amsterdam, this time with our 10 year old son. Having loved the Swissotel one year ago, we returned and were not disappointed. As stated repeatedly, the location on the Dam cannot be beat, so don't underestimate that. Others have expressed some hesitancy about the property and I think I can elaborate a little having stayed there twice. This is upscale lodging with an informal ambience of hospitality. If you are a business traveler on company budget or leisure traveler who goes upscale rather than rock bottom, the property is excellent. Comfortable, quiet clean rooms with all the amenities you would want: room service, coffee maker, minibar, business center with internet. It is not, however, 5 star luxury with a formal air if that is what you seek or expect. That's fine by me. Note that with advance booking, particularly in off season, you should be able to get a very reasonable rate. We paid about 125 Euros per night for a premium room (one level up from run of the house room) including all VAT/taxes. For those of you in the know, that's a very fair rate for a hotel this nice in the dead center of a European city. The staff is friendly and engaging and all one need do is ask and they cannot do enough for you. If we return to Amsterdam again (great city), there's no doubt we will book Swissotel. Shout out to Sam (female) in reception who thought our son was the best kid ever! Why then only 4 dots this year, when my Jan 2009 review had 5 dots? I will agree with other reviewers that it's time for a makeover/upgrade/renovation. There were faults in the furnishings of the room that showed wear and tear, but had no impact on cleanliness or wonderful atmosphere.

We practically did not use public transportation though the tram stops are close to the hotel. The staff at front desk was very friendly. But still we were overall disappointed by the hotel as it did not meet our expectations of Swissotel standards which we had a chance to happily experience previously in other countries. We did not like that the hotel reserved an amount of 150 euro on my credit card. It is not understandable because the minibar was ridiculously empty containing only Heineken and some soda. Also the visitors to Amsterdam should be aware of the city tax amounting to 5 % of accomodation cost which is not included in total price of stay and additionally charged at the time of check-out. We were not informed about that at check-in. The bed was comfortable, the room was big but it really needs renovation and more light. The white walls had many staines. TV set was old-fashioned, the coffee maker Nespresso was complicated and uncomfortable to operate. You can use only the supplied coffee \"tablets\" (1 per person per day) which made it impossible for us to have some more (even our own) coffee. The bathroom did not produce the impression of neatness either. It was definitely cleaned but still looked shabby with scratched marble floor and old towels even with a hole in one of them. The bathroom door did not have an inside lock and the handle was broken.

The gym is adequate (open 24/7); actually that was one of the reasons I chose the Swissotel was so that I could use the treadmill and not many hotels in Amsterdam seem to have a gym. The three computers with free internet access 24/7 was very nice as well. I booked my room through Orbitz since they had a $40 off coupon for 3 nights or more, so it was cheaper than the rates being offered directly through Swissotel's website. It was a non-refundable rate, booked the day before arrival - $697 for 5 nights - Monday - Saturday, plus 5% city tax which the hotel will charge me for (I already paid Orbitz the $697). This was a great rate, and would have been even more disappointed if I would have spent more money than this. The hotel has ZERO character. The hallways looks like a cheap cruiseship. The first room I was given had stains on the toilet, used soap by the sink, and an almost empty water bottle. It was an ugly room, very uninviting and sterile. I returned to the lobby and was provided a different room right away. This room was clearly a newer, more updated room. It actually had wood, so some contrast in the room and exactly as is shown in the previous reviewer's pictures. Clearly some rooms are much nicer than others decor-wise, however the room was still pretty skimpy. So if you want some character in your room, don't stay here.

It is across from De Bijenkorf, one of Amsterdam's top department store with an excellent food hall on its top floor - a good choice for some of your meals. The Kalvertstraat shopping street is directly behind the hotel and the Nieuwe Kerk and Royal Palace around the corner. Many of the city's tram lines stop in front of the hotel and most of the rest stop two blocks away near the big Albert Heijn supermarket where you should be able to find almost anything you would need during your visit. One of our rooms was ready the morning we arrived and we stowed our bags there before heading off to get some brunch before checking back to see if the other room was ready. My room was not clean when we checked back but the desk clerk found me a clean room without any prompting on my part. Most of the rooms overlook 'streets' on the sides of the hotel that are about six feet wide. The only ones overlooking anything but other walls are those on the short sides of the hotel at the back on the Kalvertstraat or the expensive Executive rooms overlooking the Damrak and Dam Square. Windows are double paned and it was surprisingly quiet given how noisy the neighborhood is. The rooms might be described as modern? Very while and blue and somewhat sterile. I did not mind it at all but anyone looking for character will be disappointed. Everything worked well and there was the usual impressive Swissotel espresso machine. The beds were quite comfortable, the TV had English language channels so you could keep abreast of world news and it was easy to keep the room at the desired temperature.

The hotel is located right next to Dam square & though there was a funfair on the square, noise wasnt a problem. Our room backed out on to a lane way, but we'd no problem with this as we didnt book into the hotel for the view! Bedsheets/ towels can be changed everyday if you place a card on the bed requesting it, or leave the towels on the floor. On our first morning there though, house cleaner knocked on the door at 9am, which i considered way to early! The location is excellent, the staff are friendly. The cost of the 3 nights stay was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac407 which is a little bit high for considering its location I would stay here again. Its within walking distance of all attractions, ie red light district, canal tours, wax museum etc. I would definetly stay here again, and wouldnt hestiate in recommending it to my family/friends.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venlo", "Title": "\u201cWhat a excellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "IvoDusch", "ReviewID": "UR47807237", "Content": "We visited the Swissotel Amsterdam last weekend.

As the other reviews say it's about as central as you can get in downtown Amsterdam. About a 10 minute walk from the station. Right next to Dam Square and the main shopping area. As my review title says - I expected more from the Swissotel based on other reviews I read on Tripadvisor prior to my trip. It claims a four star rating but to be honest it felt more like an upmarket youth hostel! The lobby is small with few facilities, you must swipe your key to use the lift and stairs, the 3rd floor decor was rather tired and really could do with modernising. The room itself was fine, a very comfy bed but again a bit tired around the edges. All the staff were all very friendly and welcoming so nothing to worry about there. The room rate was quite cheap for a city centre hotel but I left after 3 days rather disappointed by my experience. My biggest issues at the Swissotel were generally price related - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 euro for breakfast, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac9 for a beer in the bar and a whopping \u00e2\u201a\u00ac22 euro a day for internet access! I would also urge caution on eating around Dam Square as some of the prices are hiked for tourists...I think \u00e2\u201a\u00ac7 for a glass of fresh orange qualifies! I forget the name of the place but it is next to Europub on Dam Square! I recommend walking a few streets away and you will find a good selection of cafes and such like offering far better quality at cheaper prices. The best I found was an all you can eat Japanese place about 5 mins walk from the hotel..SUPERB! Enjoy Amsterdam and maybe my expectations of Swissotel were to high based on other reviews?

As said in many reviews the location of the hotl is perfect. it is right in the centre of the city on Dam square near loads of shops restraunts and attractions. There is entertainment and street performers in summer at dam square which is good. The hotel staff were friendly upon arrival and check in (as well as check out) went without any problems. We were shown to our room which unfortunatly didnt have much of a view (a narrow shopping street at the back of the hotel) but we couldnt complain as we did go for the cheapest possible room. The room itself was a very good size. We had a huge double bed and had a lot of floor space. There was a tv with plenty of channels and a brilliant 'dolche gusto' type coffee machine which was refilled daily. The bathroom was modern, clean and generally nice with plenty of shower gels and shampoos etc. The bar/restraunt downstairs was very modern and very nice to sit in however the prices are very expensive. 2 vodkas and cokes came to about 14 or 15 euros!!! One morning also, we got 2 medium tomato juices and it came to 9Euros. We did not sample the food, but from what I saw on other peoples plates it looked the sort you would get in a top of the line restraunt. We liked every aspect of the hotel apart from the prices of food and drink, but it is to be expected as it is a 4star in the dead centre of a capital city. Right outside the hotel there are dozens of places to eat (chip stands, chinese noodle bars, steak houses, italian restraunts, indian houses, japanese places, burger kind, kfc) and drink which would not stretch your budget. Drinks can be expensive so look out for bars that have 2-4-1 promos which will make your money go further.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cBe careful using your credit card here\u201d", "Author": "MBIRE", "ReviewID": "UR26307843", "Content": "I had booked this hotel for next week the hotel has charged my credit card twice and i have spent ages trying to get the second unauthorised entry returned i have still not had the money put back on my card.

Only downside was the Dam square fun fare which was quite noisy but we expected a little noise from the trams and being so close to the square. This was out of the hotels control and it did not spoil our visit. The room was very special, clean and modern with a huge bed so if you fall out with your partner there will still be plenty of room for you both to share the bed and create quite a large no mans area. Bathrobe and slippers were also provided but you had to leave the bathrobe on your departure the slipper although cheap you could keep. Usual mini bar, safe, LCD wide screen TV, DVD player and music centre. We ate in the hotel on our first evening and were quite happy with the meal, service and price. Breakfast is quite expensive but sometimes you get what you pay for. Just across from the hotel is de Bijenkorf store and its well worth a visit to the 5th floor food hall which is open till 7pm I think but it is very modern with a good choice of foods which are all freshly cooked and prepared while you wait. For me and my wife to eat a lovely meal with wine cost only 33 euros. Great if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not sure what you fancy and you can eat outside on their terrace garden. Another gem we found was the new library between the central station and Nemo. Top floor has a wonderful eating place where again the food is freshly prepared and cooked as you order.

The first time was at Xmas 2006 where we were upgraded for free to a superior room. It was truly quite a big room and a huge comfy bed. We then returned in August 2007 for a week, again a great stay. A slightly smaller room this time, but didn't bother us because the bed was huge like the last time. We booked a superior room this time and paid for it because having the free upgrade the first time, we didn't want to be dissappointed. Although I'm sure the Classic Room is just as great. We returned in June 2008 for a long weekend. Because my partner smokes, they only had a few smoking rooms left due to the Smoking Ban that came in July 2008. They had redecorated 99% of the hotel rooms and cleaned them from smoke so they only had 2 available. We tried the Junior Suite, but found this too noisy because it overlooks Dam Square. It was a great big room, but no good because the trams were so loud. I would request a room either at the side of the hotel or in the inside of the hotel, you get a lovely peaceful sleep then. Never again would I have a room that overlooks the Square. It also had huge big windows with no Blackout curtains, this kept me awake too! We moved the next day to a different non smoking room, which was great. The Hotel Staff brought us up to look at rooms so we had the choice of the room we wanted. There is also a fire exit on each floor that allows you to smoke without having to leave the hotel, this was handy for my partner. So request a room near the fire exit if you want a smoke. Also, I was told theres 2/3 hotel rooms with balconys that you can smoke on. You will need to request these rooms, but they are on the front of the hotel, overlooking Dam Square. The Dam Plaza is part of the hotel but fairly expensive, the food is outstanding. I'm so fussy but there was not one thing I could fault with that food. Burgers, Chicken, Steak, Fish - all gorgeous. The Room Service is spot-on too. The Dam Burger is very srcummy! The bathroom is very nice, modern and clean. You can listen to the TV in the bathroom as it has speakers. Great Bath and shower. Sheets are changed every 2 days. Fresh towels when you want etc. The Dam Plaza also have a small Bar now, which was only put in this year, 2008!

I booked a standard room and when I got in paid 40 euros extra to upgrade to a superior room. A tip: on the website the superior room was 225 but I paid 40 extra so got it for only 165. So if you want to upgrade do it at the counter. 2nd tip: the superior is not that much superior to the standard room so dont waste the extra money. Room was large size for european standards. For some reason there was not enough lighting in the room. Here is the strange thing. This was a superior room and the TV was a 14 inch small one. I wonder why they have not upgraded the TVs. The best part about the hotel is the location. It is on the main Dam square. There are bars, cafes and restaurants all around. You can walk to the hotel from the central station. Another place in Amsterdam to go for good bars and restaurants is Leidseplien. It about 5 tram stops away and tram costs 1.60 per trip. This is a great hotel to stay at the price.

It is close to everything from shopping to attractions and restaurants. The best thing about this hotel is their terrific staff. The staff is extremely knowable, courteous and helpful. They cater to their guests. There is nothing that they wont do to make your stay enjoyable. I emailed the hotel 2 days prior to my arrival and they were able to check me into my room by 11AM. The rooms look exactly as they appear on the website. They are extremely clean with nice furnishings. The window does open and when closed they are soundproof. I was in a premium room. The one flaw of the hotel is that the classic and premium rooms are very small. As noted on the website they are no more than 200 sq ft. However, they are nicely furnished and the small space is utilized very well. Housekeeping is excellent. The wireless internet connection was not working and you should bring your own ethernet cord for the wired connection which is 15 euros/24 hours. It worked great. The bathroom was small but very clean with the usual bath ammenities. Note that the bar of soap given is the size of a half dollar so you should pack your own. The water pressure was excellent with plenty of hot water. I used the well equipted gym facilities everyday and the business center offers free internet and printing for guests.

The hotel was very centrally located, with Amsterdam being very easy to get around, even by walking. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. On checking in we were informed that we had been upgraded to the business suite. We had previously decided not to pay the extra for the upgrade as from what we could see, the only differences were room size and a coffee machine. We never saw the standard rooms on our trip. The room was fantastic, very big with an amazing bathroom. Great toiletries, very warm and powerful shower, quick to run bath and large space. Great views from our room of dam square, very easy to use heating system, complimentary half bottle of wine and toblerones, as well as mini toblerones on the pillow every night. We took a room service breakfast which was absolutely delicious, delivered on time and more than I could possibly manage. I do reccomend putting your do not disturb sign on the door untill you are ready to get up as the maid repeatedly rang our door until we did one morning. The downsides, overall it was all very clean but the cushions and throw which we found in a cupboard were definitely not and clearly are not cleaned for long periods of time, we just didn't use them. We were on the first floor right above the reception and this may have been the main downside, we heard a lot of noise at night untill the trams stopped and there was a busker on the saturday night. I still slept well, so assuming you are not bothered about early nights then this shouldn't be a problem. Alternatively, ask for a higher up room which may be quieter or one atthe back which will lack the nice views. Overall, its great value for money, great rooms, great location, great staff.

The room was huge with a mini dressing room, a lounge area, a huge bed and a bathroom with jacuzzi bath and big shower as well as dressing gowns and slippers! What could we say...fantastic!

Room: #217 wasn't ready when we arrived at Noon ,but was soon after. is one of a few that's has a balcony (small enough for 2 to stand out on) that overlooks Dam Square and its a beautiful view, people everywhere.From where I could see there were no more hotels with this. Room was well appointed with Comfortable bed (not like the Marriott but good enough), good linens and a separate downstairs landing when you come in the and you could never hear any hallway noise. Good bathroom except little counter space, HOT steamy shower, safe, good closet space, desk. Room is actually on 3rd floor. Tips; I Amsterdam card. If you stay busy and like to tour its the way to go. Learn to use the trams, as they are easy quick. Rent a GPS (from City Navigators) while we watched numerous people trying to figure out maps we walked from place to destination w/out hardly ever a mis-step. Watching the kids Ice skate in Leidseplein Sq. .Get To Anne Frank House early and miss the crowds. The Good: Balcony overlooking Dam Sq, Balconies are few here in the Dam but almost unheard of overlooking Dam Sq. The Staff as wonderful as they will attend to your needs. We felt security to be excellent at this hotel. You need your card to enter the elevator and staff is always present. Very clean Hotel as well. Excellent e-mail communication with hotel staff before arrived and helped us with all of our needs. Not so Good; Its a Loud room and you have to be okay with that going in.Run the ac/heat on High and it cuts out most of the noise. Weather last time we went it was July and there is no comparison to Winter. Its costs a lot more to go in Summer and I can see why, its as much the long hours of daylight as it is the temperature. Like many shower only baths water runs out in to bathroom floor quickly , the shower is so good its hard to turn off. Room never did get warm above 65 degrees. After our second trip to Amsterdam I would say we easily prefer Leidseplein to Dam Square. I also have to compare the Swissotel to the Marriott. If we had to choose it would be Marriott due to wanting to be in Leidseplein and its generally a better area to us than Dam Sq. Bed was more comfortable at Marriott.

I was looking for a decent place, at least four starts and centrally located, but that it would not cost me 1200 euros per room for just three nights (the trip was on me and I knew we would rarely use the room). Thus, I booked rooms at the Swissotel through bookings.nl at a pretty good price (498 euros for a standard room for three nights and 689 euros for the suites). When more people wanted to come to the trip and the hotel appeared to be sold out using the online travel sites they contacted the hotel directly and they gave them the same rate I got. I must mention that the attention and service via email while doing the reservations directly with the hotel was outstanding (thanks Ms. Schutte). Even the concierge emailed me giving suggestions for restaurants and answered most of my follow up questions. It sounded too good to be true so I kept some cancellable reservations at five star hotel where I had stayed many times before across the square just in case that we did not like the hotel. However, upon arrival, the service was as expected, they had most rooms ready for early check-in. The hotel is perfectly located in Dam Square, five meters from the tram stop! and the best thing is that you cant hear any noise in the rooms despite the location!!!

Amsterdam is very compact city and i mean we walked..... to the Van Gogh Mueseum,Anne Frank house, Red light District, Heineken Museum.... just to name a few.

It's on Dam Square, a short walk from the main train station and canal boat terminus. A number of trams stop just opposite the hotel meaning that you are just steps away from a connection to all parts of the city. Damrak, the street on which the hotel is located, is home to lots of shops of varying quality. Just opposite the hotel is a large, high quality store and there are lots of souvenir shops a few doors away. The very impressive Magna Plaza shopping centre is just around the corner - it's worth a look just for the amazing interior. The hotel is not very impressive looking from the outside - it's quite unassuming - and the reception area is small and unremarkable. We were given a free upgrade from 'standard' rooms to 'superior' rooms. It seems there can be a great difference between the quality of superior rooms. My companion's room was lovely and big, with a large bathroom containing bath and separate shower, seating area for 2 people, and all in all it was a spacious room. My room was a lot smaller, no separate shower and the finish in the room was really poor - dents in the door and wardrobe door, 2 cigarette burns in the bed covers and net curtains. I wasn't very impressed - and probably less so because I'd already seen my companion's room! I was appalled to find that the bin in the room hadn't been emptied and peeping out at me was a porno DVD cover. When I checked the sink in the bathroom, there was a stain so I called reception to complain about the housekeeping service. One of the receptionists came up to see what was wrong, offered me a free drink for the oversight and sent housekeeping to empty the bin. It turned out the stain in the sink was a permanent fixture. I was convinced that this must be a standard rather than superior room, but on checking was assured this was of superior standard ... could have fooled me! I was suprirsed to read negative comments on this website about the soundproofing of the hotel because I found it to be excellent. I'm a very light sleeper and absolutely hate hearing noise from other hotel rooms. This is one of the few times that I can honestly say I didn't hear a sound from any other room. My companion who had the nice room, also had some kind of huge fan - presumably something to do with the air conditioning - just under her window and she had enormous problems getting to sleep, but in my lesser room, I had a great rest! I have to say the beds are very comfortable, there is a great range of channels on the TV - including BBC1 and 2 - and I LOVED the coffee machine in the room. It felt very decadent. The rooms also include a safe, ironing board and iron, mini-bar, 3 telephones (including one in the bathroom), a desk and nice leather chair. Another great feature was the guest office on the first floor which has 2 computers for guests' use and free internet access. As this was to be a relaxing break we decided to take breakfast in bed every morning at a cost of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 per time. This was only \u00e2\u201a\u00ac3 more than the restaurant price for breakfast so seemed worth it. We were very impressed with the lovely range of pastries and bread provided, along with eggs, bacon, coffee, juice and fresh fruit. I'd recommend it! We tried the restaurant for dinner on our first night and it was fine but nothing spectacular. The menu is unremarkable and doesn't change. I wouldn't really recommend it for dinner - you'd be better off finding somewhere out in the city. All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Swissotel but there definitely are some problems there for the management to address. Staff at the hotel are helpful and courteous.

I'd asked for a quiet room, with king sized bed and a view if possible - my priorities were in that order. We got lovely views of the rooftops. But what none of the reviews mention was the carnival/funfair on Dam Square. It's impossible to escape the noise until it stopped at 11:30pm on the Friday night and then again at midnight on Saturday. But below the hotel room is a sidestreet with a Burger King which opens late and must be used as a spot for night-revellers to get a feed. So there was lots of screaming and shouting all night - so on the Friday night we got little or no sleep - it's hard for the hotel to claim the rooms are soundproofed when streetnoise permeates the windows (they might as well have been open all night). The breakfast was not included, but we tried it on the final morning. Arriving 30 mintues before breakfast ceased there was no scambled egg left, the bacon and beans were dried and unappealing so we went for cereals, juice, tea and toast. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac34 euros for two people was a rip off.

All major sites are within walking distance, or are accessed quickly via the city's tram network (which again stops in front of the hotel). Admittedly, this is a business class hotel, so despite that facility being very clean and modern, it nevertheless felt somewhat cold and generic. Rooms however were of a good size. Do note that should your room be at or near the front of the hotel, street noise (especially the trams) can be heard in the room with the window(s) closed. This is not a sound-proofed building. My travel party occupied 2 rooms during our visit. I was in a room near the front of the building, hence the noise previously described. My companions occupied a room near the rear of the building with a view on to an inner courtyard-type space. Their room was totally noise-free.

Basically this is the centre of the City and is filled with Bars, shops and is a short walk from Anne Franks house and the station. The suite was massive, the hotel was so clean you could eat your meals of the wooden floor (if thats your thing) and the service was first class. It was also cheap for a suite and we got it at a reduced price, do dev worth checking out. Bad Points - The only ones I can think of is the glass door in the suite which dosnt move and the shower door is unfrosted glass (ok if your not bashful), also you dont get breakfast included in price.

Train from Schipol into Centraal Station is a breeze. Walked from Centraal Station to Swissotel (straight down Damrak), which took about 10 minutes maximum. Arrived at hotel at 2pm approx, and were shown to room 386 (I think), which looked into a dark void or alleyway. I was pretty surprised, as we had booked a \"superior\" room. The room was pretty small, but pleasantly furnished. Before unpacking, I asked if we could be moved to a room with a better view. Two minutes later, we were shown to room 111, which looked right onto Dam Square. It was larger than the first room, with cream and blue decor, and very bright and sunny. I was slightly concerned that the noise from tram stops outside would be annoying, but although you were aware of them trundling around, they didn't affect us at all. The area around Dam Square is excellent, plenty of places to eat and drink, and we did lots of walking. We bought tickets for the Canalbus, which was a great way to see everything. You could hop on and off wherever you wanted, and the ticket was valid until 12pm the next day too. The price was 16 Euros pp. We ate out at Gauchos Argentinian Steak House (between Dam Square and RLD), which was excellent. Second night we ate out at Haesje Claes in Spuistaat, which is a traditional Dutch restaurant. It is surprisingly large, but very olde worlde. Unfortunately, our waitress got our starters and wine order wrong, which had a knock-on effect to our main courses, which were overcooked. We didn't complain, although we would normally, as we were in \"happy holiday mode\". We were a little disappointed, as we had been specifically recommended this restaurant by a friend. Third night we ate at Kantjil en de Tijger in Spuistaat, which is an Indonesian restaurant. We had a banquet for two, which comprised of about 12 different dishes with a large bowl of rice. Delicious food and nice clean restaurant. Total bill approx 74 Euros. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. We were really surprised at how beautiful Amsterdam is. I'm not sure what we were expecting, but Amsterdam exceeded all of our expectations. It has everything you could possibly want for a lovely city break. Lots of lovely buildings, friendly people, gorgeous eateries etc etc etc. The Red Light District is only a very small area over two canals, and can be avoided if so desired. We had to take a look (obviously), and found it to be a bit tacky and seedy. We were offered drugs, but this wasn't unexpected, so we just kept walking. Keep your hands on your wallet though, I didn't even take my handbag with me, just in case. There were lots of dodgy looking characters in the RLD waiting to take advantage of unsuspecting (or drunk or stoned) tourists. Be streetwise, if someone asks you what time it is, just ignore them - they want you to take your hands out of your pockets, so that they can put their hands in and take away your valuables. Anyway, in summary, Amsterdam is a beautiful place, well worth a visit.

Although the rooms had no views, they were spacious and comfortable with very acceptable extras such as a large bowl of fruit, bathrobes, tea/coffee making facilities and iron & ironing board. The staff in the hotel could not have been more helpful. For my mother-in-law's convenience due to her age, we took a taxi from the airport each way, which cost 45 euros and both drivers expected a 5 euro tip! A little excessive we thought. Had we been on our own, we would have taken the train to Central Station and walked to the Hotel, which was only about a 10/15 minute walk away. We were central to everything in Amsterdam - tram stop across the road - and the report which complained about the non-nearness of the canals had a different view to ours. There was only a 10 minute walk along Damrak either way to reach the canals and those by Central Station included all the canal boat excursions you could have wished. We had a evening meal in the hotel's adjoining Dam Plaza restaurant which was very good and we also dined in the restaurant of De Roode Leeuw two doors away and the Restaurant Reflet in the Grand Hotel Krasnapolsky across the square, both of which were excellent. We did the evening dinner canal cruise which was a little expensive at over 60 euros, but could not be faulted for the atmosphere and experience. The tour company offices for excursions, booked for us by the friendly Hotel staff, were just across Dam Square, which was also very convenient. The Panoramic City tour, which finished at the Diamond factory, was very disappointing and not worth the money but the trip to Volendam and Marken was very good in terms of value and content.

An impeccable hotel with comfortable beds, plush towels, nice art and a friendly staff is great, but if the hotel is isolated, disconnected from the heartbeat of the city and doesn't in any way accentuate your understanding and enjoyment of that city, then it has not really fulfilled its potential. That's why our enjoyment of the Swissotel went well beyond what we found behind its sliding glass lobby doors. Let me explain: 1) Swissotel is right on Dam Square, which is convenient and appropriate in more ways than one. First off, it's very close to most of the things you'll want to see, and the fact that the Amsterdam tram line stops just a few steps outside the hotel's door means that even those places that aren't as close as you'd like them to be (like the Van Gogh Museum) are still easy to get to. Second, Dam Square itself is the best place to hang out and watch Amsterdam life unfold. (That subject is worthy of an essay unto itself, but I'll spare you.) 2) The businesses that surround Swissotel add to the experience as well. For example, there is a world-class bakery just a couple of doors down, as well as a small grocery store. That opens up all kinds of options. Amsterdam is not particularly known as a culinary wonderland, and it can be an expensive city. Thanks to the proximity to these two establishments, for dinner one night we dined on prosciutto and cheese on fresh-baked ciabatta, chased down with a nice inexpensive bottle of Bordeaux, in our room at the Swissotel. There were shops that intrigued my wife, and a nice department store just across the street. Souvenirs? Right there. Nice gifts? Next door. People worth watching? Everywhere you look. 3) The hotel itself is great -- the staff is all very proficient in English (as are most everyone in Amsterdam) and are happy to give advice, directions, etc. We used them as a resource as we planned what to see and how to get there. The fact that you must have a hotel room key to access the elevator creates a much more secure feeling. The rooms are comfortable and well cooled, and the mini-bar is reasonable and also a great place to stash the goodies you buy at the afore-mentioned shops. 4) One final piece of advice: While close proximity to the train station has been mentioned, it's still a decently long walk, particularly if you are dragging as much luggage as my wife likes to bring along. Taxis are readily available outside the train station, and the quick ride won't cost you much. Swissotel would be a nice hotel if it were on a deserted island. But situated where it is, surrounded by complementary establishments, with the tram line outside its door, in easy walking distance of plenty of sights, it's even better.", "Date": "August 10, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle upon Tyne, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, brilliant location\u201d", "Author": "Penel0pe_Pittst0p", "ReviewID": "UR3574132", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights to celebrate my birthday in June 2005.

Everyone was extremely busy. We reserved a junior suite and although I'm not sure what I expected, it was below the standard I was expecting for the price we paid. My negative comments are as follows: we arrived early by train and were told that the room wasn't ready as a frequent guest had requested late checkout. We were able to leave our bags with the concierge, however. We returned to the hotel about 3:30PM and our room still wasn't ready so we were offered a complimentary beverage in the bar. We were finally able to check-in a little after 4PM. The floor was sort of a wooden parquet but very dull and didn't look clean. In fact, my husband had to call housekeeping to come up and clean something that had been spilled on the carpet. The bedding looked rumpled and not fresh and clean. There was some \"debris\" left in a cupboard by a previous occupant which again led me to believe that the room had not been properly cleaned. When we went to check out there was a major rain downpour. Granted the hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station but the point is that the concierge did not go out of his way to provide us assistance, i.e. no offer of a hotel umbrella, etc. The tram stopped just outside the door but there was no cover near the tracks where we would have to wait and impossible for taxis to come or so said the concierge. If I were still 20 years old this would have been a great adventure to trek through the rain but we are in our mid-50's and for the price we paid for a supposed 5 star hotel, we felt that they could have done better in assisting us. We didn't eat there so I cannot comment on the food. Probably the best thing about this hotel is its location, right on Dam Square. Our room had a view and given the activity on Easter weekend, it was fun to watch. The bathroom was nice enough, but again, after you've stayed at the Shangri-La Kowloon in Hong Kong for example, well this hotel just didn't measure up in terms of service or amenities.

The website photos looked great and the staff had responded to all of my email requests quickly and graciously. Traveling with friends, we booked a superior room at a rate of 185E and an executive suite at a rate of 295E. for a four night stay. I arrived around 10am, pleased to discover the hotel was honoring my request for an early check-in. The process was quick, the staff very friendly. Unfortunately, my happiness level decreased when I saw my suite. I was located on the 6th floor overlooking Dam Square. Decorated as you see in the web photos with blonde and dark woods, the tiny living area was about 7-8 feet with a small sofa, chair, desk and built in cabinet with an expresso maker, minibar and tv. The promised cd player was missing. There was a small doorway to the bedroom just barely holding a king-sized bed with another small doorway to a bathroom. Very small, almost like regular room but cut into two compartments. I called the front desk and commented that the suite seemed very different from the one shown on the website which contained a table and chairs. I was told that I'd been given one of the largest suites. This, I learned later, was not true. The second room wasn't ready until later in the day. We appreciated that the staff had provided a room right across the hall from the suite, facing the back of the hotel. It was a tad dark but otherwise fine with the same blonde/dark wood decor. The bathroom was spacious with a very large bathtub and very clean. It closely resembled the website photo. The hotel is located on Dam Square across from the Royal Palace and just a few blocks from Central Station, the center of tourist mecca. The Grand Krasnapolsky is across the square and the Hotel Amsterdam is next door. The tram stops right in front of the hotel with additional stops for other routes very close by. This makes the hotel very convenient. You can hop on a tram or you can walk to your destinations. We walked everywhere, had a fun dinner and walked back to the hotel with no problems. The suite was claustrophobic to sleep in and the noise of Dam Square made it impossible to keep the windows open. The tram bells proved to be the greatest challenge. A housekeeper showed us a junior suite the next morning and, at our request, the hotel allowed us to move into it, generously lowering our rate to 225E. A VAST IMPROVEMENT over the suite. The junior suite is about the same size but without the wall that creates the separate living area. The bathroom wall is made of glass, which adds to the feel of spaciousness. The junior suite is larger than the superior room and not as dark. Bottom line: skip the executive suite and get a junior suite. Request the \"07\" suites.. rooms 207-507. They are the best with a tiny set of stairs into a room with a beamed ceiling. We didn't land one of these junior suites but the housekeepers recommend them. They also recommend the suites on the opposite corner of the building. I think they are rooms 217-517 but I may be off. Apparently these are junior suites as well the larger one bedroom suites. They also have a tiny set of stairs into the room and come with tiny balconies overlooking Dam Square. If you book with Swissotel, email the hotel and request these corner rooms. Breakfast came with our rate but we only ate in the hotel a couple of times. The breakfast is good, with a variety of breads, pastries, cereals, cheeses, smoked fish, eggs, bacon, sausage, coffee and fresh juices. But there are so many other places you can go and if breakfast is not included, you have to pay 20E which is too much in comparison with all of the nearby cafes. I was also a bit outraged that the hotel charged my friend 20E for the 'breakfast' on the morning of our arrival when all she had was a cup of coffee and roll while she waited for me to put my things into my suite. Other observations: the rooms have AC but it does not always work very well. You cannot leave your windows open because of the noise so the rooms can get a bit stuffy. The decor is very pleasant and contemporary, Definitely a step above many of the other hotels in the area, but even recently renovated rooms have a bit of a 'worn' feel. The beautiful wood floor of the junior suite was badly stained in one area, truly a shame. The housekeeping staff is top knotch. The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are spotless. The staff overall is very accommodating although one person left us cold. The internet access offered from the rooms is spotty. I could not get it to work and could not get someone from the staff to help me. I had to resort to the business center computers. Also, the crowds of tourists during the day wear you down quickly and the street toward Central Station is a bit seedy at night. I think it is because the hotel is very close to the Red Light District. The hotel has great potential. You really want to like it with its upscale room decor.. central location.. pleasant staff.. and clean enormous bathrooms. Hotels often grow on me after I get past the biasness of my expectations. Unfortunately, this one did not. I doubt I will stay there again. After walking around Amsterdam, I think I will sacrifice the 'great location' on Dam Square for the charm of the canals and more 'residential' areas. I am more likely to stay at a place like the Ambassade for less money, more charm and a bit of quiet.", "Date": "June 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester UK", "Title": "\u201cLocation location but.....\u201d", "Author": "ajhaeh", "ReviewID": "UR3514462", "Content": "Great location situated on Dam Square and within easy reach of all the museums and usual sights.

Bearing in mind the vast number of steakhouses and small restaurants just outside your doorstep, I suggest you spend your time and money elswere.

This was my first trip to Europe and I decided to make it a vacation trip to get the tourist experience. When I first arrived at the main Central Station and walked outside, I walked into a full blown CITY. I certainly didn't expect to see anything like that so you can imagine the culture shock for me. I am from NYC, but I only expected to see canals and historical buildings so I was pleasantly surprised. As we walked straight down the street to find our hotel, I was also pleased that Swissotel was right on the main strip and close to all the malls, souvenir stores and restaurants. It was approximately a 5-10 mins. walk to the hotel and it was VERY easy to find. When I walked in I was assisted by the concierge desk to be checked in immediately by just giving my name. I asked for the gentleman who did my reservations to thank him for everything and he was still there working late as usual. The hotel staff was very cordial and welcoming which I appreciated being that I did not speak the language and it was a new surrounding for me. I was given a map during my check in and the front desk guy pointed out the main points of the city and what trams (which are all right outside the hotel) will take me there which was very helpful. The Hotel: After checking in, you must have your card key at all times for this hotel because to prevent outside people from every getting into the hotel or elevator you need a key for that also. It is for security purposes because the hotel is right in busy time square so I was happy with that also. The hotel room is VERY modern and unlike any 4 star hotels I stayed in. When you enter with your key, you MUST leave it inside a slot by the door in order for the lights to come on. (Another security measure) The TV was on when I entered and my name was on the screen welcoming me, which gave the room a personal touch. I stayed in a superior room which is online and it was very spacious for my cousin and I since we are both females and need it. The bed was huge and can also be separated into twin beds; their is a huge coffee maker like the one in my office where you don't need to add water as it is permanently connected to a system, hidden fridge with a fully stocked bar (snacks, candy, liquor and other drinks) at a charge. The bathroom is VERY stylish and the cleanest I have ever seen, you can tell this hotel was recently remodeled. There is a phone in the bathroom as well as surround sound in the ceiling for anything being played on the TV in the bedroom. The hotel supplies the guest with a bathrobe, iron w/board and lots of storage with closet space which we utilized to the max. Service: The front desk, concierge and housekeeping are ALWAYS at your disposal and will assist by the touch of a button. I have NEVER had service that good that it was scary. On our first morning, I called to ask how to operate the coffee maker because as I said it was not a normal one. Instead of giving me instructions the concierge came upstairs personally in less that 1 minute and did it for us. I was shocked out of my wits when I called room service for extra sugar and cream and they came instantly. If you want better service than that, I think you need to hire a servant. LOL! Honestly readers, I don't need to give more detail of my experience at this hotel because it was all FIRST Class for me and I stayed at many name brand hotel chains all over the US and never got superb service like I did at Swissotel. I read a couple of the recent complaints and I believe some is exaggerated and not as critical as some other situations people could have received.

However, the establishment is usually highly recommended and, after e-mailing the hotel to confirm the building works have now been completed, I had no hesitation in booking my stay at the Swissotel. One of the greatest advantages of the hotel is its location on Dam Square. It is literally a 5 minute walk from Centraal Station, which has frequent trains to and from the airport (about one every 10 minutes). You just head out the main exit of the station and walk straight down the Damrak - a busy, vibrant street full of shops and restaurants. The hotel itself doesn't have a restaurant, but this is not a problem with so many other establishments nearby. As well as the Damrak, behind the hotel is a fabulous network of shopping streets, with restaraunts ranging from the usual McDonalds and Burger King to chinese, indonesian and dutch cafes and restaurants. The hotel itself is quite modern, with a welcoming reception desk, a small lobby and elevators that service all floors. We elected to stay in a Junior Suite on the 5th floor. We were originally going to book both the flights and hotel through Expedia, but found it was actually cheaper to book the hotel only through this site, and get cheaper flights through Easyjet (as we were flying from Britain). Indeed, for the same price Expedia quoted for a Superior Room plus flights, we found we could actually upgrade to a Junior Suite when we bought the flights separately! What attracted us to the Junior Suite was not only the larger room size and good location at the front of the building, but also that it was the only type of room that guaranteed a king size bed. It was my first holiday with my boyfriend, and so we decided we should definitely go with the Suite! The bed is huge - it could easily fit four people across. There is also a sofa with a large television, as well as a large desk and chair, spacious wardrobe and in room safe. One side of the room was made up of large floor-to-ceiling windows, which opened up and provided a fantastic view of the streets below. However, the highlight of the room was the huge bathroom that was separated from the rest of the room by glass doors. (Luckily, the toilet was behind a shaded door to maintain privacy!) There was also a bath, sink, and massive shower. Very nice. On the final day of our stay, we decided to order breakfast. We had gone for the cheap option of buying breakfast from McDonalds and various bakeries on previous mornings, but thought we would splash out on our final morning. At 20 Euros each, it's not cheap. The food provided was adequate, but I'm not sure it is worth 20 Euros. You get to choose from quite an extensive list, however not everything we selected was delivered to us. We ended up with coffee, two cups of juice, two bowls of cereal, two bowls of fresh fruit, one serve of bacon and one serve of eggs (in the hot food section on the menu, you can only choose one item each, which makes it a bit difficult to construct a fry up!) Like I say, it was adequate, but I would urge visitors to fill up at nearby eateries instead. Also, while staying in our room, the hotel provided bathrobes, which are free of charge for the duration of your stay. However, I was a little surprised when I could only find one bathrobe! And, upon ringing the front desk, I was told this was the standard! Upon my request, the desk kindly sent up a second bathrobe, so no complaints. Although I did find it strange that the standard practice is only one bathrobe is provided per room. The hotel also provided one bottle of water free of charge, rather than two, and when they turned down the beds, they only did one side. Not a real grumble, but it was a little confusing when there was clearly a couple sharing the room! The hotel is 4 stars and it does deserve that rating. It is clean, modern and efficient. European hotel standards are different to those elsewhere in the world, and 4 stars may give some visitors the impression it is going to be something more than it is. However, you just have to go with the flow, enjoy what you are provided with, and, most importantly, don't linger in your hotel room - get out there and enjoy all that this wonderful city has to offer! :-)", "Date": "November 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland, Aalten", "Title": "\u201cexcellent service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2759977", "Content": "Excellent service. specially Front Desk and Housekeeping staff are very nice and helpfull.

The junior suites are spacious and refined, with great views of the Dam Square and the National Monument---the 5th floor in particular has wonderful high ceilings with exposed beams. The inlaid wood floors in the rooms, the marble-topped mini bar, the leather chairs, the giant wardrobe, the artwork---everything about this place exudes elegance. The spacious bathroom with separate shower and soaking tub, marble floors & countertops, fresh flowers, and complimentary bathrobe and slippers is beyond compare. As I said, I am a regular traveller to A'dam and after staying here I will never stay anywhere else. The breakfast, although not included in the room price, is more than worth the extra 20 euros. Also, all the staff members were friendly and helpful...including one HOT bellboy who I've got some stories about that aren't appropriate for sharing here!!! As to those reviewers whining about the renovations...I was there again in August, and yes there was some scaffolding, but I was NEVER awakened by the workmen or their noise. All hotels undergo some renovations at one time or another; this is not the first hotel I've ever stayed in while improvements were going on and I bet it won't be the last. The Swiss\u00c3\u00b4tel is a very nice place to stay, and it is my hotel of choice when visiting Amsterdam.", "Date": "September 6, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, England", "Title": "\u201cExcellent quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "SimonPDurham", "ReviewID": "UR2503123", "Content": "I was understandably nervous when I booked this hotel, then read some of the reviews here, so much so I emailed the hotel with copies of the reviews and asked them to comment.

When we arrived I was surprised to see the scaffolding as no mention was made of any building work. The room was amazing, and was possibly an executive suite having looked at the photos in the hotel lift. We had a large living room with a dining table, sofa, chairs and tv as well as Espresso machine. The bedroom (behind sliding doors) and bathroom were together the same size as the living room. The bed was massive and very comfortable, and the bedroom had it's own tv. The bath was a spa bath and the separate shower excellent. A complementary toblerone topped off our delight as we settled in. In the evening there was some minor traffic noise and the odd tram could be heard. The view was obstructed by the scaffolding but wasn't what we'd booked the room for so we were not concerned. Unfortunately we were woken at 07.15 to the sound of builders. There was an initial roll call and then hammering for over half an hour. Not really what we'd hoped for on a romantic break. When we checked out I raised this with the staff who apologised stating that the builders were not supposed to start before 09.00. I accepted the apology as it seemed genuine and the rest of our stay had been so good, however reading these reviews it would seem that the 07.15 builders wake up call is a regular occurance. I'll be taking it up with the hotel. Once the building work is complete I would recommend the hotel as it was one of the best I've stayed in.", "Date": "August 27, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, PA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful room & helpful staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2458288", "Content": "We stayed at the Swissotel for 3 nights. Our initial reaction to the outside of the building was disappointment because there was scaffolding, but the quality of the room and the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff more than compensated for a compromised view of the Dam Square, which frankly isn't the most beautiful thing to look at when you wake up anyway. The first room to which we were assigned had ineffective air conditioning, and the staff then reassigned us to another and better room. The room was very comfortable and a joy to come \"home\" to at the end of each day. Also, each member of the desk staff that we interacted with was courteous, pleasant and extremely helpful. They always had good and helpful answers to questions about restaurants, transportation, the local cinema, museums and anything else. Thanks to the staff's suggestions, we avoided waiting in line at the Van Gogh museum, we saved money on our rides on the tram, and we ate at good restaurants. I noted while there that there were no workers on the scaffolding. Had there been, I can imagine that their presence would have been a problem if they had started working early in the morning. I think this is a very good hotel that becomes an excellent one once the exterior work is done and the scaffolding comes down.

Our bathtub did not drain properly and spewed sewage when we ran the faucet. After complaining to the condescending manager, our rate was reduced by 10 E a night. We were not at all happy with this hotel or its treatment of us. Also, it was very noisy at night, with noise coming from the carnival at the Dam square, and the tram which runs right outside the hotel, as well as from the generally very busy street outside.

It's very near to Centraal Station, which is great if coming from the airport. The Hotel itself is right near Dam Square, and 5 minutes from the Red Light District - so you're near the action! I had booked a Superior room and was given a single superior. The room was spacious, but the bed was a small double - no real issue there but I expected a standard hotel double (Queen) - there is a difference. The people next door were quite noisy, so I asked if I could be moved, and reception moved me to a superior double - good staff. The room (superior) - big, spacious room. Clean and furnished to general 4-star hotel standards. A large desk for business travellers with an excellent leather desk chair. An expresso coffee machine was a pleasant surprise. A clean and excellent (with above average pressure) shower. The bed was disappointing. Looking like a kingsize, it's actually two doubles thrown together - careful you don't fall through the gap! My room, as with most of the rooms had no view. And expect to hear noises from most of the rooms - unless you specifically ask for a quiet one! The Hotel doesn't have a lobby as such - just a reception area and a sofa round the side. The restauraunt is small but there's no excuse to be eating there, when there's a whole city to explore. Breakfast menu is restricted and expensive. In summary - the superior room is of good size but the two beds thrown together was disappointing. Having no view was also disappointing but as a tourist, one shouldn't be spending too much time inside.

Staff and Service-staff are very kind and will help you with directions or whatever you may need.
