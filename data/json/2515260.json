The staff were all really friendly and welcoming from reception through bar to breakfast. Talking of breakfast, there was a good selection of continental breakfast items, fruit, eggs and smoked sausage, and two lovely tarts - not great on the figure but a delicious treat for a holiday breakfast. I like the fact that it was fairly small - about 50 rooms I think - and a little bit individual rather than the large generic chain hotels where feel you could be staying anywhere. The bar/breakfast area n funky colours with comfy chairs - the secluded courtyard to the rear looked like it would be a tranquil spot for a quiet drink when the weather is slightly warmer. The room we had was clean and spacious (junior suite), with a really comfortable king sized bed. The loo was separate from the bathroom (nice touch) which had an amazing power shower that blasted us awake in the morning and a lovely deep bath The location was great for us - 5 or 10 mins from the Tour Eiffel and the Seine - up which we took a lovely cruise (just right on a rainy afternoon), about 15 mins from the Arc de Triomphe / Champs Elysee. We also walked to and from the Louvre and Pompidou Centre - a bit further a field but on a lovely sunny day and surrounded by the fabulous architecture, what's not to like?

I requested a special room as i had booked the trip as a suprise for our ten wedding anniversary and my husbands 40th Birthday, we were given no special treatment with regards to rooms, our room looked over the parking area and faced the rear of the buildings on main road, they are inneed of a refurb. the reception area is nice however the furniture is in need of a replacing. the hallways to the rooms are massivly in need of redecortaing, they have been done poorly with paint marks on the wall paper, as my heart had already sank due to the look on my hubbys face when he seen the outside of the htel it sank even more when the lift opened to reveal the shapby ness of hallways, howeevr i was pleasently suprised when we opened our room, it was very clean, it had a desk with chair, two tubb chairs with a reading table and aking size bed, the laundry and towells were changed daily which is always a bonus. there is a mini bar whcih is well over priced (small bottle of evian 4 euros!) the negative was there is no tea and coffee facitlies, (which the hotel describtion says it has, along with bath robes which we didnt have) the charged 24euros for a continental breakfast which we didnt opt for as far too expensive i did though borrow two teacups and there hot water to make a cup of tea each morning (we had our own milk teabags and sugar in the room) for this they charged me on departure 20 euros plus tax! i was disgusted that we could have a steak meal acroos the road for 18 euros and they could charge 24 euros for a cups and hot water! they also do not carter for english people with regrads to the TV, you may think this trivia as Paris is the city of love but realistically when you spend the entire day site seeing when you do come back to your hotel room after a shower you sit a and watch a little tv, to have the news (bbc and sky) on a loop is depresing to say the least! the bathroom was great, shower powrful and Bath deep so you could recoup after being on your feet all day. The hotel staff were very nice and pleasent there is a Carrefour located 1 min away so you can but water and snacks there, its open from 7am till 11.0pm there is also a lovely Sushi bar opposite a nice pub/bar on the main road called Kleber Pub, nice steak and chips but the waiters are great, they also have \"happy hour\" from 5-7pm in all the two nights stay cost me \u00a3340, do i think its value for money? No ..would i stay hear again? propably Not..would I reccommend it? depends, if you wanted a no frills then yes, if you wnated a hotel to to give you that little bit more or to be better located then no, i would recommend you choose a hotel closer to the Louvre as the majority of sites and buildings are located at the bottom of the champs de Elysee.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA very comfortable smaller hotel in a near perfect location.\u201d", "Author": "Denis B", "ReviewID": "UR123899481", "Content": "I booked the Hotel Garden Elysee online for a long weekend birthday treat for a special friend.

A restaurant minutes away was recommended for dinner on my request and it was excellent; 'Jammin' it's called. Seemingly full of locals too, which is what I prefer. The hotel bedroom was clean, fairly spacious and had everything anyone needs for a couple of days. The bar/restaurant area looked nice enough but we unfortunately didn't try either; when in Paris... There's apparently a gym area etc too, but of little interest to us!

The hotel is in a quiet road near Trocadero and the Champs Elysee (well, near is relative, but walkable) and lies back off the road and so is even quieter. The entrance and lobby/bar area are promising and I found all the reception staff friendly generally. Sadly, the room I stayed in, on the 5th floor, wasn't 4 star in my view. It was, it must be said, roomy and very clean, but the decoration was tatty, there were chips in the bath and the shower head was jammed on one setting (it worked, so I didn't bother complaining). TV reception was poor (this seems to be a common problem in Parisian hotels, though) and the complimentary toiletries weren't high quality. There was free wifi (in this age all 3 star and above hotels should offer this, I believe) which is always a bonus. I didn't eat here, so can't comment on the quality of the food, but I ate a very good meal in the Restaurant St Didier (a very unpromising looking place a few metres up the road from the hotel) one night. If you are expecting 4 star standard, I think you will be disappointed in the Garden Elysee, but if you look at the price it's more in line with 3 star hotels in Paris and at that standard it's roomier and cleaner than a number I've stayed in.

It is located on a quiet street off Kepler Avenue, which makes it ideal for visiting Trocadero, the Eiffel Tower, and the Arch of Triumph. It is also very close to a metro station, which, for us, made commuting very easy. The hotel has an internal front yard/parking and a secluded garden, both of which add to the impression that you are off the bitten track. To be absolutely honest, based on the pictures on the hotel website, I expected the garden to be a bit bigger. However, it was the ambiance that mattered. We stayed at a room on the third floor. The furniture were neatly arranged and the bathroom was clean, but there was nothing extravagant about either. There is a minibar with a wide spread of snacks and drinks, though--as expected--with an extra charge. The hotel staff was particularly polite and eager to help with every question we had. They offered suggestions for sights to view and arranged for taxis to pick us up whenever asked. There were also tickets to tours at the reception. Even if we preferred not to buy from there, as we didn't want to restrict ourselves to a schedule, I found it very convenient for someone who doesn't really want to plan far ahead but would like some structure in their vacation. What I enjoyed least from the hotel was the breakfast, which comes with an extra charge of 22 Euros per person per day. My husband and I got the breakfast one of the three mornings we were there, but were a bit disappointed both by the variety and the quality of the food. Indeed, there were some bread to toast, croissants, a few kinds of cheese, cereals, ham, jam, juice, and fruit, but not the spread expected from a 4-star hotel. There was nothing cooked on demand (e.g., omelette, scrambled eggs, or crepes), which would have made a big difference. The juice was squeezed some hours earlier--or so it felt--given that it didn't taste too fresh. And the most annoying to the eye were the grapefruit halves, which must have been cut the night before, as they were really dry.

The conference offered good rates at the Meridien and Concorde Lafayette which are both large luxury hotels, but I wanted a more \"boutique\" experience while in Paris. I found a great deal on hotwire, so the price couldn't be beat. The Hotel: While is may not look like much from the front (it's sort of hidden down a short alley/side street), the lobby is very clean and modern. There isn't much in the way of amenities here, but if you're in Paris you shouldn't be working out or sitting in a hotel lobby! The Rooms: They are small, but spacious in comparison to other rooms in Europe. It's just not fair to compare the size of these rooms to the overs-sized/all suite places we see in the states. The Location: When you are in Paris, you are expected to walk (probably why the women are so thin there). That being said, I was in heels the whole time and never had a problem getting around. Also, for the fashonista, it's incredibly close to the Champs-Elysee (where I splurged on Chanel purse). Also, the public transit system in Paris is phenomenal so it was not a problem to get to all the major tourist spots. The Staff: Fabulous. I did not encounter any Parisian snootiness as some have warned me about (my fiance's family is from England so they may be slightly biased). They were incredibly accommodating and friendly. I am a young (very young) single female traveler and they treated me with the utmost courtesy. Extras: They have an elevator, which is great for any boutique-ish hotel. Also, everyone speaks English...which is the case in most of Europe anyway but one less worry. Overall: Fabulous hotel and value. Great for someone who frequents luxury hotels, but wants to try something low-key with the same level of service and cleanliness that you expect from 5 star hotels.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUtterly wonderful weekend\u201d", "Author": "AnnieLinton", "ReviewID": "UR96580529", "Content": "Wonderful hotel in an excellent location.

The room was a good size (double room) with a ensuite with shower above the bath. The bed was comfortable and the room very clean. The service was excellent - right through from check in to checking out. We pre-booked the hotel 2 months in advance so got a good rate (around \u00a3150 per night) so this is why we rated it good value (the 'rack rate' is very expensive at around 350 euro per night). The only niggles we would have were there was no light to see in the wardrobe (but it was a good size with plenty of hangers). We also ran out of toilet roll and tissues which weren't replaced (but we could have rung down). We also had a tea and hot chocolate in the lobby which was a little pricy at 10 euros (although cheaper than one of the local pubs which charged us 15 euros for a coke and Orangina! - Paris is expensive!). Breakfast in the hotel was also quite pricy at 16 and 22 euros (but we guess this is to be expected in a nice hotel). There is an excellent small sushi take away/sit in restaurant just across the road (Planet Sushi) which is reasonably priced and good quality ( you can get this on room service, but obviously more expensive than going in yourself).

My friend said yes, and the recepcionist guy said: \"don\u00b4t want me to paint your shoes in black for you?\" and laugh. My friend almost didn\u00b4t believe what he was hearing... He just smiled and went out). The stuff of the hotel is, as well, clearly too desperate about money. They charged us 70 euros just to book the Moulin Rouge show.

They said it was just an advanced pay, and I\u00b4d pay just the difference concerning the tickets over there. What a lie... I had to pay the full price over there.

From the minute we arrived, the experience was very disappointing. The staff at the check-in desk was not very welcoming, not very helpful and even rude. The junior suite was of an acceptable size, but it was a major disappointment. It was very dark (even with all the lights on), with patches of damp and peeled painting on the entrance hall of the room. When I complained to the reception desk about the smell of damp the only answer that I received was 'open the window'. The deco was very dull and the carpets could do with some updating. The bathroom was OK. The room was overlooking the garden (more of a small patio than a garden), although the main view was an ugly internal massive wall. Compared to any 4-star hotel across Europe the facilities provided were well below the standard. Some positive points: the location; it's quiet, with hardly any traffic noice; breakfast was good.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Garden Elysee", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197914-Reviews-Garden_Elysee-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$233 - $473*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">12, rue Saint Didier</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">16th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75116</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515260", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/b6/99/b699b48c1a40053646583d9f3f7e19ae5large.jpg"}}
