This hotel is located just around the corner from the San Marco Water Taxi Stop. So easy to get too. From Santa Lucia Train Station, hop on the Water Taxi (#1 or #41) and go to San Marco, get off, walk a few short blocks and you are there. The hotel website has great and easy walking directions on their website. They provided a free breakfast but it was barely adequate and served in a very small room that doubled as their sitting room during the day. Having said that their server who cleaned tables in between guests did a great job of keeping the tables moving and clean and serving a coffee and tea very quickly. The rest was buffet. Basic continental though the items were often on the stale side and the fruits very limited. On our check out day we had to leave before breakfast began (by about 1/2 hr) and asked if we could get coffee to go (something other hotels in Italy did for us) but this hotel did not accommodate that request. If it's location you want you'll get it but don't expect friendly cheery front desk folks because you won't find it here. The front desk people (except Chris who was very friendly) are sullen and non-accommodating. They will help you if you ask but you're left feeling like you bothered them unnecessarily. Smiles are also not given freely if at all. It could be a cultural thing in Venice?? The hotel has 3 floors and we were on the very top floor. We had to walk 59 steps to our room and 59 steps down each time we left. It's good if you want a cardio workout and don't mind carrying your stuff up and down these steps. The room was frankly horrible. It was small barely larger than a double bed. It had a double bed, a window (with a view of the building next door even though their website says every room has canal view) and the TV was a 12 inch TV propped on top of a 6-8 foot wardrobe crammed in front of the bed. If you have claustrophobia, don't pick this hotel as despite it's great location, you are likely not to enjoy it. The hotel entrance and lobby are very quaint. Right outside the doors of the hotel is gondola rides and lobby has lots of charming antiques.. but the carpeting is very old, the hotel beyond the lobby is shabby and our room was stanky.. dusty (we had to dust our own headboard) and very very small. Having said all this, we still enjoyed our stay in Venice and loved the location of this hotel and since we spent very little time in our hotel room we were able to take deep cleansing breathes at nite to avoid a panic attack before falling off into an exhausted tourist induced sleep.

Hotel Lisbona certainly meets these two criteria. Pros: Hotel Lisbona is very close to St. Mark's, Harry's Bar and a Vaporetto stop. The hotel clerk was very kind to my husband and me. He even carried our luggage up the three flights of stairs. Breakfast in the morning was more than adequate. It included a toast, rolls, croissants, cereals, juices, cheese, meats, and a pastry. Fresh cappuccino and tea were brought to our table by a kindly woman. The hotel offered/arranged a free water taxi ride over to a glass factory on the Island of Murano. There was no pressure to buy anything at this factory and we received a fun and informative tour of the glass factory. Our room did overlook the canal and at night it was fun to open the window and look at the gondolas passing by the room. There is a major gondola station from which you can commission a gondola ride right outside the hotel. Cons: Our room was VERY tiny. I believe that this goes for the rest of the rooms. If you are planning on carrying a lot of luggage, this is not the place for you to stay. The bathroom was tiny, as well. It only inlcudes a stand up shower, not a bathtub. The bed was not a true full or queen. Rather, it was two twin sized beds pushed together. Unfortunately, I rolled into the center gully on several occassions. This seemed to be a pretty common occurrence, though, in Italy. The mattress itself was fairly stiff and there were only two pillows, which were not very supportive. To be fair, we did not request additional pillows. The air conditioning worked moderately well. We stayed during a wave and the room was stuffy at times. Don't expect American standards of air conditioning; you will be disappointed. I was happy with my experience because I suspended my American understanding of hotels and recalibrated it to be in keeping with what is offered in Europe for this price level of hotel.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chelmsford, England", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel experience of my life\u201d", "Author": "krayner1", "ReviewID": "UR17382724", "Content": "We booked this hotel via GTA travel, and it wasn't cheap. We chose it for the location next to the venue for the wedding we were attending. With an 18-month-old and me heavily pregnant, convenience and some decent, comfortable accommodation was our top priority. WHAT A NIGHTMARE. Hotel Lisbona has the cheek to claim to be 3-stars. We booked a double room with cot and the information on the website we booked through promised a canal-view from all rooms. The room we got was a depressing shoe-box overlooking a service alley. Only 7 ft wide, with a 6 ft bed in it, it was a joke. I walked in and said where is the other half of the room?! You couldn't open the wardrobe for the table in front of it and the air-con (controlled by the penny-pinching manager down at the front desk) took approx 8 hours to bring the room to a reasonable temperature, meaning we spent 2 nights in a hot, poky hovel with very little natural light. The mini-bar didn't work, so no cool drinks either. The cot would not fit, so we ended up dismantling it (plus they wanted an unreasonable 20 euros per night for an old rickety travel cot - not mentioned when booking). There is no lift, and the 57 stairs to our room killed me. Breakfast was uninspiriing. Nothing fresh at all, not even a piece of fruit. However, the main problem with this hotel is the arrogant, rude hotel manager who saw our issues as our problem, not his, and who was quite prepared to have a stand-up argument with me, despite my condition. He should also appreciate that some foreigners can speak Italian so he should watch what he says. Rather than guests, you felt like an inconvenience from which he wished to extract as much cash as possible. His attitude towards us was very upsetting and totaly spoilt our stay.

First time in Venice, so nothing to compare it to in the area. Location: Fantastic location, once you find it. The hotel is next to the Hotel Bauer (5 star) in San Marco. That should be easy, shouldn't it? well, there is no signs apart from a very dim lit \"hotel lisbona\" under a covered arch. It is not visible from the street. To find it: Coming from the vaporetto/P. San Marco, pass the hotel Bauer on the left, go over the canal and turn left passing the Gondolieri cabin. Yes, it is there, although you will not see it until you are under the arch. Check in: Nothing to talk about. Give the passports, get the key, upstairs to the left..... Found the room. Room: To put it in nice words, cosy. Room 22 (not the smallest) was 3.5m by 3.75m. Yes that's the bed and nothing more. Even the minibar was hanging from the wall. The TV, a 14\" set was 3 mts high on top of the cupboard. Good selection of channels, with CNN and BBC world in english. The bathroom was.... well a one person affair. They have managed to include the loo, a bidet, basin and shower. So crammed that I barely fit. The shower is laughable. 55 cm wide by 60 cm deep. It must sound like I love measuring, but I did get a measuring tape as a joke. I could not believe it. You won't be able to wash your feet (the bidet comes in handy) The most striking feature of the hotel is the traditional feel to it. The walls are covered with venetian pattern fabrics and the chandeliers show the Murano style. Fantastic view from the window. With the gondola service just outside the hotel you can hear the gondolieri singing in the afternoon. Breakfast: Juice, tea/coffee, croissants, bread rolls, selection of cereals, cold meats, cheese, preserves and packaged toasts. Nothing warm. They don't have a kitchen. They don't even have a toaster. Not great but very convenient. Housekeeping: The hotel is kept clean. It boasts 3 stars, but for you and me this is a good B&B, probably a 4 diamond (without the breakfast).

My friend and I stayed for 3 nights in January - a great time to see Venice as there are hardly any tourists. It was so close to St Mark's Piazza and right next to the San Moise church so you can't miss it. We had a twin room on the top (3rd) floor which was tiny but spotlessly clean as was the bathroom which had a hot, powerful shower and bath. The twin beds were really narrow - I fell out of bed on the first night! - and the stairs up to the top floor were a bit knackering but it was worth it as it was such a charming hotel in a perfect location. The continental breakfast was good - fresh rolls and croissants, cheese, meat, jam, cereals. I would definitely stay again and reccommend this hotel to anyone. There's a really good pizzeria (run by a chinese family) close by if you are on a budget and the American bar set behind a bookshop is good (both on the street leading to St Mark's). There's also a range of decent restaurants on the other side of St Mark's square on the road next to the American Cafe. Word of warning - if you fancy going to the famous Harry's Bar for a bellini you will need to re-mortgage your house to pay for it! A complete rip off and the decor is nothing special.

You are so tired from a day of walking that I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even notice so much. Ok, that is it for cons. My favorite thing was the windows in our room. First of all visiting Venice you must absorb the sounds. In the streets you hear people taking, shoes clicking along, music and no motor cars! From our window I enjoyed the gondolas slow rhythm in the water. It is a soothing sound that echoes between the buildings on a quite morning. A sound that I can hear quite well as I write this review. We were on the top floor in the corner room and had lovely views from our shuttered windows. The rooms are spotless. The bathrooms are spotless. The shower is adequate and has lots of hot water. Tip, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let you hose get a crimp in it, for some reason you only get cold water then. The sheets are spotless and softer than I expected. The heater worked well, it was cold when we were there so I am can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak for the cooling. The keys are enormous, we left ours at the desk every morning on our way out and we always got it on our way in. There is always someone at the desk. Smiling and enquiring about your day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans or your adventures. We were out quite late at times and there was always someone at the desk. Breakfast is on time and simple but good.

Go to McDonalds if you need an American fix. Our room was ok quite, not silent but good enough for us. We stayed five nights and were very pleased.
