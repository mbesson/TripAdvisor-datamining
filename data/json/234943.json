The rooms are cramped. The furniture and decor deserve \"relic\" status. The hotel offers a passable breakfast, which is a nice start to the day. But, like the hotel itself, breakfast consists of basic fare offered with a half smile. Most of the staff seem perplexed if not downright diffident toward basic requests. Wireless access requires the purchase of Internet credit cards available (sometimes) at the front desk. Unfortuntely, the front desk ran out of the 5 EUR cards (smallest denomination available) repeatedly thoughout our two-week stay. For the money, you can do better. Berlin offers a slew of low-budget but high-quality hotels in far more inviting locations. The hotel is located a few blocks from the Rathaus Steglitz U-Bahn stop, which is a plus. However, if you choose to drink or dine in the area, visit the General Post Office pub, a fine establishment to the right and a couple of blocks northeast of the hotel.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stewkley", "Title": "\u201cGreat.... clean, friendly efficient staff, nice neighbourhood\u201d", "Author": "woofJasperwoof", "ReviewID": "UR80812231", "Content": "My colleagues and I stayed at the Hotel Ravenna to attend a business meeting in the local area. For a sub-100 Euro hotel, it was great. Staff were helpful and friendly, the rooms were clean (a little dated furniture wise, but what would you expect for \u20ac77 in a European capital city) and the buffet breakfast was above average for \"continental\" (Selection of juices/fresh fruit, cereals, yoghurt, fresh boiled or scrambled eggs, selection of meats/cheeses, selection of breads/rolls, etc). The neighbourhood is safe, (leafy green suburb of Berlin), but close to some shopping malls and supermarkets. Rathaus Steglitz U-Bahn station is a 5-10 min walk giving access to two underground train lines into central Berlin. There is an Italian restaurant next door which was relatively cheap and the food was great and there are other restaurants and pubs nearby. 10 minutes walk turning right out of the hotel are the Botanical Gardens (\u20ac6 entry)...my colleague and I only had an hour to spare before we needed to get back to the airport, but it was fabulous, the tropical plant houses and the tropical plants inside them are huge! I would certainly have no problem staying at the Ravenna again and would have no problem recommending it to friends/family.", "Date": "September 24, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Ravenna", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d234943-Reviews-Hotel_Ravenna-Berlin.html", "Price": "$83 - $125*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Gruenewaldstrasse 8-9</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Steglitz</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">12165</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234943", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/36/64/366476958aa0c7ebae82dffb5da8aeb34large.jpg"}}
