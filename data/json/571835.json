It's located in Pacific Beach and either you will love the its edgy-funkiness (like Venice, California 20 years ago) or you will wonder what a sexy-cool hotel is doing in a neighborhood like this. If you have a large sense of entitlement, and seeing some grit and edge will just ruin your martini or G and T, do yourself a favor and stay in La Jolla just up the road. In PB, you are far more likely to score a tattoo than a designer boutique. That said, the hotel is a modern minimalist gem. All glass and white walls. A video loop of surfers plays endlessly on a small monitor the unpretentious lobby. The action here is in the Bar/Restaurant JRDN (pronounced a little surprisingly \"Jordan\", not \"jardin.\") Serving mostly very good food and a lively scene, it's particularly packed on weekends when the weather is good. The other great space is the Tower Deck on the second floor where white-towel covered lounge chairs surround something resembling a wading pool. I think it's six inches deep and I have never seen anyone so much as put their foot in there, so, hey, maybe it's just a water element or something. Nomenclature aside, it's a great place for a hang or a tan or to watch the joggers, surfers, runners and homeless people walk, run, or waddle by. The rooms are clean and uber-minimalist, almost sterile if it were not for the drop-dead views. I recently stayed in a Sanctuary Suite and loved the extra space and the jacuzzi tub looking out over the crashing waves of the Pacific. The bathroom also sports a small sink, a stand-alone shower and small slightly depressing room with a toilet. I am hoping it's fluorescent lighting is a green gesture and not a design choice. Yikes. Most if not all of the rooms have terraces on which you can see and/or hear the crashing of the Pacific. With \"art\" like that, who needs art in the rooms? This is not a place you come for white glove service, but the staff is young, attractive and happy to be helping you in any way they can. They try really hard, but sometimes you can really feel them trying and the strain shows. Bottom Line: This property is my first choice when I come to San Diego for any reason, business or pleasure. It's perfect for a romantic weekend, or whenever you want to get-away from it all. A recent four-day stay undid months of work/life stress. And if it worked for me, it might just work for you. Give it a try, I don't think you will regret it.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cday1", "Title": "\u201cGreat deal, right on the beach!!!\u201d", "Author": "cday1", "ReviewID": "UR126738796", "Content": "We stayed here in Feb 2012 off a deal we got on Bloomspot.

We stayed in a \"Sky Pad\" with two queen beds. The hotel is very modern with a laid back \"beachy\" attitude, so if you're looking for traditional or posh/luxury accomodations, this isn't it. The staff at the front desk were friendly, helpful and prompt. We asked them for recommendations on several occassions and their advice was useful. The good: The beds/linens/pillows are very comfortable. Some rooms have direct access from the room to the terrace on the 2nd floor overlooking the beach and boardwalk. It's a great place to people watch, relax and read, or just share a drink while watching the waves. The location of the hotel is close to restaurants (Kronos is great for breakfast!), bike rentals, and the beach. We didn't need a rental car. The not-so-good (these are minor in my opinion): It's a popular spot for going out so the bar is always full--day & night. Fun if that's what you're looking for, but it can be loud and crowded. We were awakened on two nights by yelling and loud noises from the hall or the terrace. Probably not the fault of the hotel but if you're a light sleeper, you may go home tired. Neither the room nor the bathroom have much storage so if you like to unpack and put out your make up, hair products, etc. in the bathroom, you're going to have to improvise.

We ate at the hotel restaurant one night which was excellent. Overall we had a great stay with the family and will be back. My only complaint is that we asked for a good Mexican restaurant recommendation. Jeremiah at the front desk recommended Cafe Coyote. It was awful! Do not go to this restaurant. The food tasted more like fast food then good Mexican. Tower 23 should not be recommending this restaurant to guests.

This hotel is so cool, a famous indie rock band stayed in our same room the same week. Location: RIGHT ON THE BEACH. The sunsets were out of this world. We were addicted to the sunsets from our room at T23...we raced to the hotel to see them. JRDN: This restaurant is truly gourmet--and at a hotel. We shared 4 dinners at JRDN over the course of the week. We knew our waiters by name. The food was OUTSTANDING. Best oysters I've ever had--we compare all other oysters to the ones we had at JRDN. Room service: Room service was interesting because it wasn't just a room service delivery--it was like the restaurant came to you. We had loads of delicious breakfast foods included in our room rate. Every bit was executed with perfection. They were prompt and we loved our server, Meredith. And Josh--well, there were 2 Josh's. All were so much fun. Room: The products--OMG, the products!!! I can still smell them when I think back to Tower 23. The balmy lotion was my favorite. Seriously awesome products. The mini bar was well stocked, there were loads of snacks, and even souvenirs you could buy from the room. The robes were a good weight and we wore them a lot. The bed was enormous with tons of fluffy pillows. Chaise lounge was handy and comfortable. We loved our balcony, too. Nice sized closet and great TV. Service: I've mentioned the service was perfection. We were on first name basis with so many of our servers by the end of the trip. Do yourself a favor--stay at Tower 23.

I have been to San Diego before, and the area that this hotel sits in usually has a lot of students coming in to party. I was traveling with my family and I did not know what to expect. Fortunately, Tower 23 was able to dispell some of my worries. We arrived and our room was spottless, and they brought our bags up promptly. We stayed in a ocean-view room on the 3rd floor. Our balcony opened up to the main patio, but it seemed to be sound proofed really well. Even when the patio was full we were never disturbed. Housekeeping did a great job. Valet was always on point, we never had an issue getting our vehicle. The employees were great with my son also, which was a big plus! Tower 23 sits on a great beach, with a spectacular view. Sunsets are amazing from the pier. There are plenty of restaurants around the property. Try Kono's for breakfast. You get a big breakfast for a reasonable price. Make sure you bring cash, because they don't take credit. Also try Narraya's Thai Cuisine and Fillippe's Pizzaria, they have great pizza! They also have the usuals around like IHOP and Denny's, that are in walking distance. La Jolla is not far away, and they have good places to eat there too. Mission Beach is close also, try Olive Cafe for breakfast, you won't regret it. You also can take Grand Ave to I-5 to go back into town to check out the Gaslamp District or go east to the fashion district, or to University.

The hotel labels itself as a four star luxury lifestyle hotel and I will assure you it is not. The food, the view, and one friendly staff member were the only positives. We arrived wearing sweatpants after traveling all day to be greeted by a valet asking \" are you here for dinner?\". I believe it was more than obvious we were there to stay. True, my husband and I are young ( 25 and 26) but i think it was assumed we were just local young party people rather than guest paying 1100+ for a 3 night stay. We then arrived to our room. Absolutely wonderful view however furniture appears very Ikea like and the shower ran water all over the floor. Bed was very comfortable however and room was kept very clean. We did receive one bottle of Champagne complimentary for our anniversary and a second was sent Up by family with roses for my birthday which was very nice. However, after receiving these 2 bottles of Champagne and a 3rd to the room for NYE, we were carded by 3 different people before being allowed to be seated at our dinner reservation! The same people that had checked Us in and sent up champagne made my husband walk back up to our room to get my ID, then issued us a wristband. Even with the wristband now in place , a bouncer then came to ask us again for identification. Finally , the hostess seating us asked if we had our wristbands and if we were of age. I understand there are rules/ laws However there is a point where it is just rude. Finally, we were in and out of the hotel multiple times over our stay and other than check im and check out never received so much as a \"hello\" from the front desk staff standing right beside the elevator. From other experience, I would say friendly and respectful greeting and treatment of guests is something that helps to make a place a \"luxury lifestyle\" hotel.

Long story short - she has a form of neuropathy that makes it impossible to sleep on a bad mattress. Trying to find a better hotel bed in Seattle eventually led to the discovery of a list of hotels in the US that offer Tempurpedic memory foam mattresses. This list led to our discovery of Tower 23 in Pacific Beach, or 'PB' as it's known by the locals. Our first visit to this little boutique hotel was in February 2011. It was a short visit, but the impression it left on us convinced us to come back for another, longer visit in September 2011. Let me state right up front, this hotel is not for everyone. It doesn't have a pool - this will turn some people off right away. We didn't care. We didn't come to San Diego to swim in a hotel pool. I've read other reviews on this hotel and noticed a few complaints about the homeless folks who pass by on the beachfront walkway. Pacific Beach has homeless people. You just can't get around that fact. We didn't find it intrusive or offensive in any way. They did not camp out near our hotel. On to what we liked. The bed, of course. If only every hotel had quality, memory foam mattresses, our trip planning would be so much easier and offer so many other choices. A definite win for Tower 23. The restaurant (JRDN) is great. Depending on the time of year, you can get breakfast there, but lunch and dinner are year-round and of high quality. One thing to be aware of when booking a room is that about half of the beach-facing rooms are directly over the restaurant / bar area. The restaurant has an outdoor patio as well and this place can get noisy when it's crowded. Weekend nights are worst. From our room on the third floor at the south end of the hotel, it wasn't too bad. We got a beach-front room and loved it. Being lulled to sleep by the sound of the surf is my idea of heaven. The bathroom is modern and well appointed. Nice big shower and a wonderful tub. The water runs into the tub from the ceiling, which is a little disconcerting at first, but it's OK. Just don't stand next to the tub for the first minute, or you'll get splashed. But it is a great tub. The rain shower is a nice touch. Tower 23 may not have a pool, but they do have a nice Sky Deck, a second floor outdoor deck overlooking the beach with lounge chairs and sofas and a fireplace for night-time. It's a popular spot and is often full of sunbathers in the afternoon. If you have a car, you may as well splurge on the $20 per day valet parking. Taking a chance to find parking on the street is taking a big risk, as the neighbourhood is very popular and I found it almost impossible to find parking near the hotel. It's just easier with the valet. I particularly love the location of the hotel, because you're right on the ocean, minutes from trendy La Jolla, a short drive from Fashion Valley Mall and easy access to the freeways that get you all around the San Diego area and up the coast to towns like Encinitas and Del Mar. We saved some money not renting a car at the airport and getting one in PB. So we're very glad we found this hotel. It is our new home whenever we go to San Diego.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay with friends\u201d", "Author": "jeanne452", "ReviewID": "UR118825362", "Content": "We spent the week at Tower23 recently with friends from college.

The design of the overall hotel is pretty cool, a glass box over looking the ocean. Our room however was a big eh. I did not see the other rooms but based on the lowest priced room they're not really worth the price they are asking. The room itself is fine with a nice little balcony...unfortunately the balcony faces other people's rooms. They call it a courtyard view...but in actuality it's more like a voyeurs view. Our room abutted up another's balcony....enough so that their cigar smoke came into our room. Noise travels as well. If you craned your neck out the window you could see the ocean. The service, while friendly, was a little lax. When we arrived to check in (after a long flight) there was a gentlemen in front of us asking silly questions for what seemed like forever. There was only one person at the front desk, and instead of calling for help or answering questions while checking us in...we waited 10 minutes to check in. Clearly there should be a concierge person and a check in person...not just one person. We also returned home to find the valet parking closed at 10pm on saturday night. The gate was down. We came down to hang out on the deck in the afternoon, only to find no cushions or anywhere to sit. We had to run around to the front desk and get security to come open it. That's a little strange. All of these little glitches are understandable but at the price they were charging should not have happened. This is clearly a smallish design hotel but that doesn't mean they have to be small on service. That being said, the sunsets from this location are absolutely stunning. All in all I wouldn't discount a stay at the Tower23 but I can't say it's worth it for the cheapest room. If you want to stay at the beach then pony up the cash for the direct ocean view rooms.

I had found some cheaper and nice hotels in Gaslamp but he wanted to pay a little more and stay right on the beach. Out of all the hotels we looked at in that area, this looked to be the nicest one. It's a small hotel right in front of the beach. The room was a good size with nice bathrooms. We wanted a king sized bed, but we ended up with two queens instead. I think the regular rooms only come with two queens instead of one king. They have a deck area at the hotel (second floor?) where you can lay out, order food/drinks, and see a nice view of the beach and watch people walk by. I thought they had a pool based on some pictures, but it's just a small little water feature. We ordered some drinks and appetizers and it was fine. Their restaurant always looked like a hip, happening spot for happy hour and early nights, but we always went out to different bars and try different restaurants in the area, so I don't really have a review on the scene at night and whether the food was good. Overall, the staff were very pleasant and it is a nice hotel, certainly the nicest by the beach. It is a little pricey but that is to be expected given the contemporary and \"sleek\" look that they have going on. I wish they had a pool though, as it would have made it more worth it.

If I were going back to San Diego and wanted to stay by the beach, I would stay here again though since we didn't really have a negative experience.

I was looking for a luxury, upscale hotel that was on the beach, yet close to late-opening bars and night life. It was quite hard to find this. A lot of the resorts are either on the bay or miles from anything. Tower 23 is a modern, small and recently refurbished hotel in a prime location. It's right on Pacific Beach and has wonderful views from its terrace and bar/restaurant. It's a short walk away from a whole host of bars and restaurants in the casual Pacific Beach neighborhood. A cab to the classier Gaslamp district was $35 (in general I felt the taxis were very expensive in San Diego). The staff were mostly all excellent and tried hard to help us have a good stay. On the first night, the hotel manager made an exception to hotel policy by turning on the fire-pit on the roof for us. It was appreciated and he didn't have to do that. Another staff member brought blankets out for us. The drinks service on the terrace was also good. The hotel's bar and restaurant is excellent. It has great views of the ocean, very good quality brunch and the ambiance is perfect. I noticed a lot of locals go there for special occasions - birthday parties or weekend nights out. I booked the Sanctuary Suite at the hotel. This room was first rate. It was spacious and modern with a wet bar and comfortable bed. The signature feature, however, was the giant spa bathtub with a tap in the ceiling that fills it. Colored lights and powerful jacuzzi jets also make for a relaxing soak. DOWN SIDE: My hotel suite was very expensive and for the money I have experienced far more. It's basically a Peninsula or Four Seasons rate without a resort that even comes close to those type of hotels. Tower 23 is nice and well run -- but it doesn't have the scale or world class service of a true luxury hotel. It's more of a well put-together local hotel with a modern edge. Aside from the expensive price, my only other disappointments were: -No hotel pool - surprising! -They couldn't give us a late check out, and the normal check out time is a rather early 11am Otherwise, a great, relaxing and enjoyable experience.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cBest Beachfront Hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "mwd05", "ReviewID": "UR90956178", "Content": "My husband and I recently spoiled ourselves with a night at Tower 23.

The staff at this hotel made us feel like unwanted house guests. We were greeted by an apathetic valet that needed to be coaxed to remove our luggage from the trunk. The front desk people were nice enough but had no local info to offer us and never followed up when we asked. We asked for help getting a cab and the front desk wasn't able to accomplish this. After waiting 25 minutes, we had to go in, ask again, and make sure the front desk staff picked up the phone and actually dialed this time. There is no pool and the room amenities are low to none (no lotion at all.) The room was small and mediocre; the bed was uncomfortable and the sheets were rough. To top it off, we were kept up all night by the nightclub below us. Our complaints and request to check out later that night were answered with a \"sorry, you booked here for three days, you can't check out.\" (WHAT?!) Never once was there any question as to why weren't happy or if there was anything the staff could do to improve our stay through the night. When we confronted the manager early the next morning and asked to be absolved of our three night check-in, we were told that, \"The hotel is not for everyone and you are free to leave.\" We were prepared to list a number of reasons for our dissatisfaction, but we were never asked. There was no inquiry as to why we were displeased, any apology about our experience, or remorse at losing business. Defining yourself as a trendy, boutique hotel does not mean that you make your guests feel like an unwanted outsider... This hotel is a complete waste of time and money. We took off as soon as we could to the W downtown. My husband and I no longer speak of our 12-hour stay at Tower 23 - it was a dark time for us and we've tried to block it from our memory.

We had a problem with the toilet on the first day and it was fixed immediately while we were out. No more problems. The hotel has only 44 rooms and only three floors total. It's a nice size. It's in pristine physical condition. Our room was in the back of floor 3. Perfect. Do not be afraid of \"partial ocean view\" description. We could see the water from our room and in reality, you are either out on the Tower Deck (roof deck) or out on the beach or boardwalk most of the time anyway. Because we were in a room toward the back, \"partial ocean view\", we were set back from the wonderful (but noisy at night) restaurant and bar. If we had been in a room right out front on the water side, it might have difficult to sleep. As it was, our room was quiet and the beds are like sleeping on a cloud. I have to say we did miss the awesome breakfast served daily in the hotel restaurant, from previous visits. I believe in busier months, the breakfast will be served again daily.

The service was outstanding from the moment we checked in to the final check out, four days later. The second story deck is where we ended every day lounging in a chaise, drinking a glass of wine and eating the steamed mussels with chorizo, capped by breathtaking sunsets. Drew, our waiter those evenings, gave us impecable service along with a nice array of menu selections , which is probably why we didn't venture elswhere. We were there mid January, and the boardwalk between the beach and the hotel was not too busy until Sunday when the locals turned out for \"Sunday-Funday\". The only drawback with being beachside, was late around 2am when the \"last call\" revelers would walk down the sidewalk and wake us up. I'm sure that could have been allieviated if I hadn't instisted on keeping the sliding door wide open every night, but listening to the ocean was a must.....

We split our time between T23 and the Loews in Coronado. I was hesitant to stay at the hotel because there was no pool , however I liked that it was right on the beach. I think my husband was a little shocked when we pulled in since the hotel is literally in the back of a parking lot. After checking in we were told that there would be a party out in the deck area. What the front desk failed to mention was that the \"small party\" was basically an open party to all of pacific beach. So after a long flight from NY we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even relax on our balcony because there was essentially a wet t-shirt contest going on below us. Needless to say not the kind of thing you expect from a hotel that charges upwards of $250 a night. We kindly asked the front desk to move us just for the night to an ocean front room. This way we could at least relax without having to deal with the blaring music, since our room overlooked the deck area. They told us of course we would be able to do it for another $80 a night. That really set me off because they should put the comfort of their guest first., as the money wasnt the issue for us. When the party finally ended after 6, we went back up the deck area which was by now a mess and it seemed that all of the other hotel guest began emerging from their rooms also. Our next few days at T23 weren't as bad, they sent us up some free champange which was a nice effort. The food at JRDN is very good and, the view from the deck of the beach is A+. The server on the deck Drew was great and extremely attentive, he was as attentive as I thought the rest of the staff at T23 should have been. The hotel is close to La Jolla which is nice if you want a change of scenery. My last complaint about T23 is that on our last day there was a foul mouthed hotel employee who was getting wasted with one of her friends on the deck . Apparently it was her day off and she was using her discount ... I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listening to her conversation she was just that loud that I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but overhear.

On first checking into our room we found that our \"partial sea view\" in fact meant looking onto the roadside.

We swtiched to the other sky suite not wanting to waste more money on our stay, which looked onto the patio deck, which looked onto the sea.

We slept at night with the windows open listening to crashing waves all night. Heavenly! Don't know what kind of bed it was (should have checked) but it and linens just perfect.

The room service breakfast equally wonderful. I might suggest doing what it takes to get a room with the ocean view. The interior rooms without just didn't appear anywhere nearly as compelling. The location of the hotel is perfect too. Literally just a few steps to the beach. The hotel is right in the middle of the action too. Just behind it is a supermarket for mixes, wine, whatever.

Valet parking quick and courteous. Check in informed and efficient. We had a package affair with my name personalized onto each appropriate voucher. Nice touch. As it is a popular night spot as well if you want to take advantage of sleeping with balcony doors open I'd also recommend requesting a room on the beach south end of building as the noisier action below is at the north end of the hotel building.

I would like to share the exceptional service we received from Tower23 (Erin Brady) in planning, accommodating our guests, and perfecting our destination wedding in San Diego. I contacted Tower23, namely Erin Brady about 6 months before our February 23rd wedding date. We are partial to the pacific beach area (We are St. Louis, MO residents, but I was born and raised in San Diego) and were in search of a hotel that could comfortable accommodate about 25 of our wedding guests that we were flying to San Diego. We explained to Erin that although we planned to host our wedding ceremony and reception on Crystal Pier, we were in need of a hotel for our guests, that would be affordable, beachfront, in walking distance from the pier (Tower23 is literally a few foot steps down the boardwalk from the pier). Erin offered us a room block for our guests that included a great nightly rate, and very flexible reservation/cancellation limits, and BEAUTIFUL rooms. Tower23 is literally beachfront property; the view from your room is the Pacific Ocean, the pier, and the boardwalk. San Diego is captured right from your window or deck. The architecture is a new, modern, and gorgeous building. The rooms are crisp, clean, spacious, and soothing. The beds and linens are so exceptional that many of our guests jumped online to try to purchase the same mattresses and linens for their homes. You can literally melt into the beds for hours. The decks have a clean uninterrupted view of the water, full of lounge chairs, a fire ring, and wading pool and waterfall next to you. It is so spa like and tranquil there, a true vacation. Sure there is La Jolla, and Coronado Island, but really I feel like Pacific Beach gives a much more authentic San Diego experience to travelers. The swimming (and surfing) portion of the beach is directly in front of Tower23, and the hotel in \u00c2\u00bd block from Garnet Avenue, which is the best street to hit for restaurants, bars, retail shops, and an authentic beach community. The food at the JRDN (Tower23\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attached restaurant) is awesome, we had the sushi, calamari, steak and fries, and the goat cheese dip, our table was very pleased, we loved everything. Oh, and the drinks, the cocktails are so good, make sure to indulge at least one night on your stay! I want to also make note that the staff at Tower23 was amazing.

She was available anytime we needed her. The staff at the front desk accommodated many very unusual last minute needs or ours, and were always very willing to help in any way that they could. Just days before our wedding day we ran into a problem with our hired caterer for our reception at Crystal pier, my mom scrambled last minute to find a back up venue and caterer in case issues worsened, and sure enough Erin was there, ready and willing to help if we needed her. She was the only piece of mind that we had at that point. We had all of our guests come up to us at one time or another to tell us how friendly and helpful the staff at Tower23 was. And again everyone ranted and raved about how clean, beautiful, and comfortable the rooms were.

The restaurant took very good care of our group and the food and drink was very good. We sat outside and, by adjusting our seats, there was just the right combination of radiant heat and fresh air to suit everyone. This hotel is probably the best hotel in Pacific Beach (certainly not in San Diego), but there were several small things that a hotel in this price range should do better. We had a \"surf\" room that meant the room overlooked the Pacific Ocean. Although the San Diego area isn't overly warm in mid-December, our room was too warm even with the heat control turned all the way down. The central system apparently didn't allow for cooling at this time of year. So our only choice for sleeping was to open the large sliding doors and curtains. This arrangement won't suit those who don't like the sounds of the surf, and the Saturday night boardwalk scene, to drift in. Since our doors were open, unfortunately, our peaceful Sunday morning sleep-in was marred by the sound of passing skateboards on the concrete sidewalk outside. Others in our group had \"surf\" rooms also, but with the added feature of overlooking the second floor outdoor social/firepit area. At least one of these rooms was too warm also but opening the large sliding door allowed in too much of the noise from the crowd outside until the bar/restaurant closed. Our room was clean and modern, if a little spare. The only chair was the straight-back chair for the desk. The shower drain was clogged so much that we had to stagger our showers to give the water time to drain. The lamp over the smallish wash basin hung down directly in front of the narrow mirror so that anyone over about five and half feet tall needed to look to one side or the other to use the mirror. The separate bathtub's water supply entered directly out of a chrome fixture (basically a plate with a hole in it) in the CEILING. (Alternate guess: someone had removed the shower head that might have been there originally). As you might imagine, water falling from the ceiling into an empty tub splashed out onto the floor until the tub acquired an inch or two of water. I've included a picture of the tub's water outlet in the ceiling with the water running. This is a personal preference, but in mid-December we found only an arrangement of red amaryllis in the lobby that might be called a Christmas decoration. Nothing more was in evidence.

Our trip started in L.A. as we wanted to take in two hockey games there (tickets at home are just impossible to get). Our plan was to leave right after those two games and then get down to the San Diego area to watch the waves crash on the shore from our oceanview room and spend some quality time together. When we arrived at the Tower 23, the experience could have taken a horrible turn. The original check-in was done by a male (who shall remain nameless for now) who really obviously couldn't have cared less and who really shouldn't be part of the Tower 23 team!!! He lied to us and tried to give us a room just immediately over the bar/restaurant although we specifically asked what was below us. He advised \"a room\" and fluffed us off and sent us on our way asap! We were extremely early and there was really no reason why he couldn't just put us in a quiet room right off the bat. He told us he could only do it if we agreed to switch rooms during our stay and this was not something we were about to do for the price we were paying. After returning from a nice long walk (rooms are guaranteed by 4pm), we saw that the front desk person had changed and thankfully, we approached Nancy. She immediately took charge of the situation. Having told her that we were looking for quiet time and would be spending a lot of time \"in\" or on the balcony, she quickly changed us to an amazing room on the top floor...just what we had paid for! From that point on, the visit was flawless!!! The rooms are very clean, the amenities are lovely and there are housecoats and lovely linen and towels for guest use. Although we didn't eat in the restaurant downstairs, it looked to be quite well attended by all. There is an amazing rooftop lounging area off the 2nd floor which overlooks the ocean. We saw many people there who spent the entire day and early evening (when they light the firepit and heat lamps) just relaxing and taking in the view. Quite simply, we tried to do what the locals do and ate where locals eat and often picked up and brought the food back to the room so we could eat on the balcony, sip nice wine and listen to the wonderful ambient sounds on the room music player. During the day , we walked down the boardwalk and took in 2 hr strolls. We went out for a couple of \"nice\" meals but Toronto is such a cosmopolitan city that there was really little we could get there that we couldn't get at home. That wasn't the purpose of the trip.

We couldn't have picked a hotel that was more hip and fun than T23! We reserved a \"Surf Pad\" room that had a gorgeous view of the ocean and boardwalk. The evenings were cool the first weekend in December, but we still sat out on the balcony and enjoyed a glass of wine and watched the sun set over the Pacific. The staff was very helpful, even assisting us in renting some bicycles early one morning before most of the shops had opened. We made an advance reservation for dinner the first night of our stay, and enjoyed the food and lively ambiance of \"Jordan\" - in addition to the wonderful food. The only catch I can see is that the room has very lively acoustics, and the table next to us had 8 guests who were having a very good time (maybe more than a little tipsy) and it was VERY loud until they left. If you are looking for a fun place to share dinner and drinks with friends, I'm sure you will love it. If you are a family with small children - maybe not so much. I also would not consider our dining experience intimate and romantic - at least until the loud table got up and left! To the credit of the wait staff, they seated us in the back corner of the restaraunt next to the window looking out onto the ocean, and after the other party left we had a wonderful dinner. All in all, the Tower 23 hotel is a gem. Our room had an Xbox game system, plasma TV, a very cool radio with an Ipod dock which was playing a digital loop of some very hip mood music when we entered our room for the first time. The room is very modern-looking, white bedlinens (down or synthetic down comforter in a duvet); super comfy bed, big tile shower with glass doors (no tub) very modern and stylish feel to the room, and the entire hotel. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of Pacific Beach - there are lots of places along the boardwalk and nearby - cafes, bars, shops and so forth.

The public deck facing the ocean is a great design feature in that it allows everyone to relax and just take in the ocean at sunset (not just those folks who paid big bucks for the ocean view rooms.)

It is about $30 from the airport and about the same to downtown San Diego. I was attending a business meeting /convention and was happy to be staying at this smaller property a bit away from it all with good reviews. I had a rental car which costs $20 per nite to park at the property. The rates per nite are pricey so I was expecting an experience consistent with such a rate. I arrived at about 2:30 PM after two long flights ; i travel a great deal and this was the end of a busy travel season . It was a Saturday afternoon and the front desk person indicated that the room was not ready and that they guarantee the room for 4 PM. This is approaching the late side for check in as most hotels are for 3 PM check-in. She asked for my cell phone and said she would call me when the room was ready. She did not do this and I returned after 3:15 PM and asked about my room and another gentleman indicated that my room was ready. While waiting, I saw that there was a wedding party readying for a ceremony /reception apparently at a different venue; but people were milling about by the small courtyard looking out over the beach. When I returned from a dinner meeting at 11 PM , the wedding revelers were now congregated outside my bedroom on the courtyard having drinks and making huge noise which continued until nearly 2 AM despite several calls to the front desk. This is a charming , small property and simply is not designed for such a real time celebration at the expense of guests' sleep. The nite manager was thoroughly inept and the daytime manager with whom I reviewed the matter was very gracious and abated one nite's charge by 50%. But the experience fouled my sense of the place. The bar is hopping and I enjoyed being out for drinks with colleagues on one nite. The restaurant is simply outstanding with beautifully prepared food and staff who are professional across all domains. Rivalled any restaurant experience in great dining places around the country. But the management has to decide whether this is an upscale boutique hotel or whether it is a function hall . The manager made a decision to sell drinks through the nite on the private courtyard the remnants of which I captured on my cell phone camera in the early AM and to ruin the experience of others versus asking the party to move to the very large bar at the other end of the hotel.It was a bad decision on the manager's part and which he never addressed.

I knew the reviews were mixed, but decided to stay there anyway to check it out for myself. The hotel is definitely overrated and it seems as though it didn't fit into the PB scence. Our first night there, it was obnoxious, b/c we could hear people downstairs at the bar screaming and fighting until 3AM! The other nights it was ok, noise level was moderate. Rooms are nice, no coffeemakers, but coffee was available downstairs, in a very awkward place (near the elevators), and was only available until 9am or so. The bathroom lights were dim, so you need to apply makeup in your room. Service was okay, I see where others complained about young staff and courtesy. The hotel was nice enough to print out our boarding passes before we left, but the girl at the front desk was so clueless. I had to tell her about 5 times our comfirmation # because she couldn't type? All in all, we though it was expensive for PB and probably would opt to stay in La Jolla next time.", "Date": "December 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las vegas", "Title": "\u201cnot as good as it looks\u201d", "Author": "dustrust", "ReviewID": "UR4148759", "Content": "the service isnt all that good. there was a sanitation problem with our room that was never resolved, when i told the front desk the man just starred at me. no apology what so ever. he didnt even ask details of the problem. the employees seem young and inexperienced. the lights in the bathroom are very dim. so ladies bring a flashlight to apply your makeup.", "Date": "November 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent, Washington", "Title": "\u201cA Great New Beach Hotel in San Diego\u201d", "Author": "fboosman", "ReviewID": "UR4105415", "Content": "I felt like I was taking a big chance with the TOWER23 hotel -- it was so new that it had only one review that I could find (here on TripAdvisor). I needn't have worried -- it was up there with the best hotels at which I've ever stayed, and most certainly was the coolest of them all. The TOWER23 hotel is an anomaly, an ultramodern hotel set in a bit of a funky beach town (the Pacific Beach area of San Diego). There's nothing nearby that's like it -- accomodations in the area range from mid-range condominiums to dilapidated cottages set on a pier. But the setting doesn't detract from the TOWER23, and in fact seems to bring it into sharper relief. I had an oceanfront room, a \"Surf Pad,\" which was delightful. The bathroom was stylish, the shower large and equipped with a rain-style head. The bed was one of the two or three most comfortable I've ever slept on. The flat panel TV was great, and I used the Xbox to play DVDs that I had brought with me (you can borrow movies from the front desk, or there's a Blockbuster next door). The room had both wired and wireless connections to the hotel's free Internet service. But the star of the room was the view -- a third-story, top-floor view of the boardwalk, the beach, and the ocean. Sunsets were absolutely spectacular. The TOWER23 has its own ocean-view restaurant, JRDN. I had excellent sushi rolls there on two occasions, and my companion and I both thought that the breakfast we had was one of the best we could remember, and reasonably priced. At night, JRDN becomes a very hip club, and we took advantage of this almost every evening during our stay. Bring stylish clothes! The hotel has a second-floor deck with comfortable seating and a fire pit, the modern style with flames dancing over sand. We spent some very pleasant evenings there drinking cocktails brought up from the club below. I wouldn't recommend the TOWER23 for people who want a very quiet hotel. Although the rooms are soundproofed quite well, once JRDN becomes a club at night, it becomes fairly loud, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. This wasn't an issue for us, as we were making use of it, but I can see some people having problems with it. Nor would I recommend the hotel for people with small children -- the beach is really the only place for them to run around, as there's no pool or playspace of any kind -- it's just not that kind of hotel. To travelers looking for a beachfront hotel, a trendy place to stay, or a hotel where one can party into the wee hours, I can't recommend the TOWER23 highly enough. It's less expensive than many of the dull mega-hotels in the city, but with better rooms and polite, boutique-style service.
