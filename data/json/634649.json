As I stood there bleeding profusely from my right arm and leg, his attitude was completely uncaring. As a mother traveling alone with my little boy, who witnessed my accident and was terrified, I was beyond shocked at the complete lack of human compassion and caring. The hotel clerk offered me a band-aid - really?? - with a wound the size of a baseball dripping blood and my elbow swollen so bad I couldn't move it? Being out of state and alone with a young son, I had no idea at 10:00pm where to go for urgent care. Not only did the staff not offer to help in any way, they had no idea where to go for care. Their only suggestion was to call an ambulance, which was ridiculous as my injuries were not life threatening. The manager refused to take any responsibility for the pothole and lack of lighting (the sidewalk was right beside the building just outside the exit door from our room leading to their parking lot). He did not even place a sign near the pothole to warn other guests. When I asked him to comp the room for the night since I got no sleep due to my injuries and the hotel being at fault, he refused and gave me the number for La Quinta's legal dept. Apparently, this company would rather be sued than provide a safe environment and compassionate staff for their guests - yes, that is exactly what I was told by the legal dept when I telephoned them. When I explained I only wanted the refund of the one night stay, they said, \"That is not our policy. You must file a legal claim\".

We had a significant problem during our stay last week. We checked in around 4:30 pm and were offered a room on the ground floor - we declined that because I found the surrounding area a bit questionable. Across from the parking lot we saw people moving along with their shopping carts of worldly possessions and the bold sign of the \"We Buy Gold\" store. We were given a room on the third floor (good so far). When we got to the room and opened the curtain it was practically impossible to see out window due to the pigeon poo that COVERED the window. I don't mean those annoying splats you get on your car... we're talking major spray and/or pigeon blowout here. Also, along the railing outside the window was a layer of poo about an inch deep. There is NO way that housekeeping would not have noticed the window problem and reported it to management. I went to the front desk to tell them about the disgusting window. The response was to the effect that \"We have a pigeon problem\" and \"You can stay there or take the room on the ground floor.\" Apparently there were NO other rooms at 4:30 in the afternoon available at the hotel. Hard to believe that EVERYONE had checked in by then since the parking lot was mostly empty. I was told that specific rooms were held for \"elite\" level customers (I guess we're only \"gold\" level). Interestingly enough the breakfast room only had about 6 other people the next morning (at a time when most hotels are usually 5 people deep just waiting for the waffle maker) and the parking lot was still not full. I asked to speak with a manger, but was told none was there (at 4:30 pm) and when I asked again the next morning (around 8:30) was told again there was no manager on site. We paid over $100 for the night. The woman at the desk that morning did give us a $10 discount - gee thanks.

We needed three rooms and most of Phoenix was booked due to sports events taking place in the area. We could only find rooms here and at the Hampton on the other side of I-10 that would be anywhere near the area where we needed to be so after sending a family member to scout out the two properties, this one was deemed to be preferable. One reason it was preferable is that while it is close to the interstate it does not sit directly on it, but is located somewhat back from the traffic. There is a row of other budget hotels between this property and the interstate highway--a Travel Lodge and some local extended stay hotel. So you do not hear the traffic noise from the interestate in this property--some noise from McDowell, a five-lane busy street, but not loud enough to be annoying. The hotel is new as the previous person posted and still had a banner proclaiming it as \"Now Open\" when we arrived 3/22. Our rooms were listed as suites and we paid $124/nt. for them. They were spacious with a separate sofa, two chairs, a round table, coffee table and desk with leather swivel chair as well as the dresser, two night tables, and the tall wooden cabinet that held the flat-screen TV and contained a fridge and microwave. There were two phones, one portable, and there was ethernet connectivity at the desk. The desk had multiple electrical outlets which was a nice feature. The bathroom had a single sink in the marble counter and a tub with shower. Good water pressure. There was a coffee pot in the bathroom, and an ironing board and iron in the closet. The closet had a mirrored door and there was a full length mirror on the opposite wall--another thoughtful item. The furniture appeared to be nicer than that found in many discount hotels and I did not have any problem with the bed or the pillows. Standard thin flowered covering on the bed, thin towels, and basic amenities in the bathroom. The breakfast in the morning was adequate--two waffle machines to make y our own waffle--pastries, bagels, white bread, cereals, juices (orange, grapefruit, apple), fruit (apples,oranges, bananas), and coffee. There is a loud flat-screen TV in the breakfast area and the breakfast crowd seemed to be mostly young people with their coaches. Despite the large number of what appeared to be sports teams at the hotel the place was very quiet. There were menus of area restaurants at the front desk and the staff seemed willing to help. I did not visit the fitness room or business center nor did I notice if the pool was functioning. We did not spend much time at the property except to sleep. There is a Sonic and a Pollo Loco within walking distance and a large Chevron station with a convenience store at the corner of McDowell and 51st. There is a Waffle House and several small local places across the five lanes of McDowell. There is a Food City Grocery, also across the street and within walking distance if one is up to crossing the busy street. Most of the businesses in the area have Spanish names and it appears to be a very bustling commercial district with what appears to be multi-family housing directly across the street from the hotel. I say appears to be because there is a high concrete block wall separating McDowell from these units. I saw policemen pull cars over on McDowell on two of my trips back to the hotel at night so it seems to be an area with a lot of police presence, but I did not feel uncomfortable at the hotel.If I had been traveling alone I think I would have still felt comfortable as the parking lot is well-lit and there appears to be a fair amount of pedestrian traffic in the area. The only problem we experienced here was with the elevator. We were on the third floor and the elevator often stopped on the second floor and refused to go to the third floor. On the day we were checking out with lots of luggage we waited with many others at the elevator. One couple waiting said they had been stuck on the elevator the day before. We finally gave up and walked down the stairs carrying our heavy suitcases. This was annoying.", "Date": "March 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston", "Title": "\u201cNice facility, short on staffing\u201d", "Author": "TravelFan", "ReviewID": "UR7161657", "Content": "I booked this particular LaQuinta because the website said it was new. This hotel is new, but they seem to be still working out the \"kinks.\" For instance, the pool is still not open as of March 2007. At breakfast, the same person who was working the front desk also had to keep the breakfast area stocked. Needless to say, one person could not do this job adequately as the hotel was completely booked. Guests had to clean their own tables in the breakfast area, and the food supply kept running out. Other than that, our stay was quite acceptable. I appreciate the free wireless internet, nice clean rooms with a mini-fridge and microwave. The beds were comfortable (but not the pillows). There is a small work out room and business center, but I only looked in; didn't actually use these two rooms. This is a typical close to the inter-state hotel. There's a fast-food mexican food place next door, and also a Sonic, but not much else. Hopefully, they will work out the staffing and get the pool open in the near future. However, for a nice clean new room, this is a good hotel.", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d634649-Reviews-La_Quinta_Inn_Suites_Phoenix_I_10_West-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "Price": "$79 - $103*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4929 West McDowell Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Phoenix</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">AZ</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">85035</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "634649", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9a/af/9aaf181f1754d01e7651a371beffc2b75large.jpg"}}
