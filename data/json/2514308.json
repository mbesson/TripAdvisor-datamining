The worst hotel experience we've ever had. The hotel is located on a busy road in Camberwell.There is no parking and we (myself and my wife) had to go to nearby residential streets to find a parking space.The walls and the decor are very dated and are in desperate need of a refurb.I didn't get the chance to visit all floors but our floor (1st Floor) was engulfed in cigarrette smell even though this is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel. The smell of cigarrettes was also intense in our room. Whenever we returned back to the hotel and opened our door, the cig smell just hits us. Sleep was ok but the sheets smelt of cigs and it was unbearable. The shower curtain....was just a disgrace and revolting. Breakfast was awful...no real breakfast just a bunch of cheap cerals,some fruits and bread. In short, i will NEVER come to this hotel again.Not even if it's the last place on earth.I would rather sleep in the open.

We are a young couple who stayed for 4 nights, choosing this hotel as it's in central London, cheap, included breakfast and has en-suite rooms. Although the room was tiny, it was adequate, and we weren't planning on spending long there. The bathroom, towels, bed linen and room in general were undeniably clean. The whole hotel is shabby and in need of attention but we felt safe and clean which was the main thing, especially after reading so many negative reviews. The tube station is quite a long walk away but the buses are regular. Breakfast was toast, cereal and fruit (hardly expected a slap-up full english from a budget hotel). Customer service is lacking but again we weren't there for luxury treatment. Keys must be left at reception when you go out which isn't ideal. Perhaps other reviewers were unfortunate, or we were just lucky but I am a believer that people only write a review if they've had a bad experience and believe this place deserved a more balanced review, and that is that it is a very basic budget hotel in the centre of London, avoid if you're expecting luxury, probably fine for a safe, clean base. Plus I personally am a fan of brushing my teeth whilst sat on the toilet ;-)", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAVOID!

The shelf type thing between the beds that the phone was on was full of fag burns, and the room did have a stale odour of someone having smoked in there. Breakfast was crap so skipped on the rest of stay.This should not have a name of HOTEL, as B&B's have higher standards. Also did not like idea of having to leave the key if you went out, so would not advise leaving anything of value as it wouldnt be safe. Spent only sleeping time in there stayed out as late as possible in order to spend least time possible in the room. If a hotel is nice you dont mind going in it a bit more.

I found both the lady and young gentleman on the front desk to be very friendly and pleasant. We were on the 3rd floor - no lift - and it is quite a lot of stairs to the 3rd floor but once in the room it had a very warm welcolming smell (air freshner but nice), the room had everything you would need, tv, window with view of london, shower etc. We were there for 2 nights and the towels were changed on the 2nd day which is unusual but nice.

The walls were in dia need of a repaint, the toilet looked like a public one in the middle of a park and the carpets looked like they had so much wild life in them I could ring David Attenborough. The sheets looked like they may not have been changed and I didnt feel alone in bed. This being the rooms I didnt arrive for breakfast .
