We expected the usual \"rabbit hutch\" sized room that is the norm for budget - moderate hotels in central London but were very pleasantly surprised to find our twin room quite spacious. The bathroom was also a reasonable size and had the luxury of a bath (as well as the shower overhead). The beds were comfy, there was a wardrobe and room to place your suitcases. The decor is somewhat dated but all is clean and comfortable. The absolute best thing about the hotel is its' location - within easy walking distance of (for example) the V & A, the Science Museum and Harrods. The Montana is just 4 minutes walk from the Glouster Road Tube stop. The hotel is within minutes of many useful amenities - cafe's, pubs, Tesco Express, Waitrose (behind the Tube station), patisseries, greengrocers and restaurants. Almost directly opposite the hotel is a Post Office/tourist centre and a few doors along from that an internet cafe (the biggest problem I had with the Montana was that the wi-fi constantly dropped out). Also opposite are Barclays bank ATMs. The hotel itself is on a very busy road but you barely hear the traffic in your room. The hotel has a good sized lift. The Montana is clean and spacious, the staff were, on the whole, cheerful and helpful - especially the breakfast staff. The breakfast included is a simple but ample meal of cereal, tinned fruits, toast and toppings, coffee or tea - as much as you can eat and drink. A cooked breakfast can be purchased if you wish. The breakfast is served in the \"Light of India\" restaurant which is attached to the hotel. We also had dinner here one night - it was very good and quite reasonably priced for a London restaurant. Just a small 'heads up', the Montana does not provide bathroom toiletries of any kind (apart from tiny soaps) nor does it provide any bathroom linen apart from bath-towels. I did find this a bit strange, but necessity being the mother of invention, solved our problem by buying some \"Chux wipes\" at the Waitrose supermarket and using them as bath mats and hand towels. Plenty of loo paper was provided in the bathroom. Also, when we arrived there were no tea-making facilities in the room but a call to reception had a tray delivered within minutes. Altogether we found this a very comfortable and convenient base to explore the area of London we most wished to see.", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThankyou for saving us!!\u201d", "Author": "tracie m", "ReviewID": "UR121638225", "Content": "After being turned away from a disgusting hotel because they said it had been cancelled.. we were stranded in London. 4 of us with theatre tickets for that night and coach tickets for the next day.

From October 17,2011 to October 24,2011 Airport to Hotel: We landed at Gatwick airport.....From the airport we took the Gatwick Express train to Victoria station which took about 30-35 min. I suggest to take the Anytime Return ticket. It cost \u00a330.80 per person but if you book it on line it cost \u00a325.90.... This is the web site to book on line: http://www.gatwickexpress.com/en/tickets-and-fares/buy-online-and-save/....Now from Victoria station you take the tube on the distract line three stations to Gloucester station its about 10 min. When exiting Gloucester station the hotel is practically across the street from the station about half a block to the left. I had a friend from Italy that met us up from for the weekend that landed at Heathrow airport. He explained to me that he took the tube from the terminal Heathrow station which is located on the Piccadilly Line straight to Gloucester station it took him 45 min to an hour. Location: Great location.... Your close to some of the major attractions . 5 min. walk to Natural History Museum (Must see place) . 7 min walk to Albert Hall .10 min walk to Hyde Park (Beautiful and very!,Very!!,Very!!! Big Park big, nice swans in the pond) . 15 min walk to Harrods Department store (Incredible store, Very good food in the food court, Hope you have lots of money.....Very expensive to shop. Besides the attractions yo have a little mall across the street with a big grocery store and a few restaurants. In front of the hotel is a little souvenir shop where you can bye post cards, phone cards etc....You have Starbucks,Burger King,K.F.C close by. A grocery store that is opened 24 hours a day. It has good beer selection but be advised you only can't buy alcohol after 11:00 p.m. Coffee shops and a couple of PUBS that close around 10:00 p.m. ATM machines right around the corner and one next to the 24 hour grocery store store. Rooml: We were staying in room 205.... It consist of a small fridge & safe. Double bed & single bed,nice LCD TV that only catches a few channels but you can order movies if you like. Phone where you can make In & Out calls but it cost money to make outs call even though your calling people in the city of London. Big Long Desk,Big Closet,cofffee maker. As for the bathroom it had a little shower, the water pressure is decent but not great. Toiilet & sink and hair dryer.... The room is very! Very!! small but clean the maids come in every morning to make up the beds give you new towels and soap... If you wanted an extra towel just let the maid know. All in all great room bed is comfortable and and you have clean sheets every day. They have free wi fi... and it always worked. Just need to go to front desk to access it. The only problems we had in the room was the T.V. Sometimes it was not working. Staff could not fix it. But we were not there to watch T.V.... One of my friends that was with me on this trip lost or got his watch stolen. It was the only thing missing in the room. WEIRD Sleep: Quiet place to get a good night sleep. No distractions what so ever. Hotel: Check in was fast.....The staff is great and helpful. Front desk has maps of the city and the tourist guides of the city. Don't be shy with the staff they know the city well and they will tell you what to check out. There is this one staff member at the front desk. I forgot his name he's bald with glasses but he was really helpful, ask him about the strip-joints in London... He's going to tell you a hell of a story. They have a 'Lions Bar' in the lobby but we did not try it. They have a computer right next to it but never worked. Elevator is small can fit 2 -3 people depending your size....lol... I think my friend broke it at one point when he startled to jump up and down in it. Restaurant: Breakfast: Not much variety...Three types of cereal,(canned) peaches and pears,Orange & Apple Juice... White & brown toast always hot with some types of jam,Banana's All the Tea & coffee you can drink. You can order eggs or sausage but it's an extra. All-in-All it's a decent breakfast and the waiters are helpful on the refills. For lunch and dinner its an Indian restaurant, we did not get the chance to eat there as we always ate out. Over-all I give this hotel 3.5 STARS.... by the way I'm a picky person. Remember to shut the curtains before you go to bed You really got to know where to go to eat. Very expensive city. I would not recommend to eat in the vicinity unless its Harrods Department store. My favourite place to eat was in Camden town in the market area.... So much to choose from and for a great price.... For \u00a35 you have a massive plate of food, the only thing its a 30 min travel time by tube but worth the trip. Over-all I give this hotel 3.5 STARS.... by the way I'm a picky person.

When choosing a location several things were very important to me: cost needed to be reasonable, location to the subway needed to be very close, and we wanted to be close to the Victoria area of London. The Montana Hotel was the best choice for us - after hours of online searching for hotels. We had a very nice room for 4 people. It had a double bed and 2 singles. The bathroom was large enough with a sink, toilet, and bathtub with shower. The location was excellent. It was quite literally across the street and 1/2 a block down from the Gloucester Road Tube Station on both the Cirle and District Lines. This is 3 stops down (or about 5 minutes away) from Victoria Station. We are able to get a flight into Gatwick, and then took that Gatwick Express to Victoria, and transferred to the Tube to get to our hotel. Very easy, even for a parent on their own who had never been to London, with luggage and 3 kids under 10 in tow. My girls absolutely loved the tiny lift which barely fit the 4 of us and 2 small suitcases. Personally, if you were were claustrophobic - I would opt for the stairs! Our room was on the 3rd floor. It was very nice and very quite. We had breakfast in the restaurant each day, and didn't order any extras and were satisfied until lunch. The coffee and tea were unending, and there was a very nice selection of cereal, toast and (canned) peaches and pears, along with melon. Orange and apple juice were also available. We did not see the need to order more. Our room was ready when we arrived at 10am, however it would not have been a problem to store our luggage there before or after check out, so that we could start our vacation.

Shower pressure was poor. The rooms were comfortable- good beds, decor was dated, bedding was worn but clean. The rooms have a fridge and free WIFI. The WIFI is limited to browsing only - no downloads and for some reason you had to put in a \"override\" code for pretty much any internet site you wanted to visit. On our second occasion we were initially assigned to a room in the 500 range. This ended up being in the basement- no outside windows, only a window overlooking the laundry facilities. It also smelled musty. We went back to the desk and requested another room, which the staff graciously gave us. Our room was on the third floor facing the street.

We booked a family room, the rate was ok for London standards, GBP160. We arrived at 2.00pm in the friendly check-in staff, small reception area, outside lived up to the internet pictures, we were advised that our booked room had suffered water damage from the room above and it would be unavailable, so they gave us 2 rooms for our stay and would only charge us the family room rate, not a problem, girls in 1, boys in the other. Rooms were very clean, well looked after, beds and furnishing were comfortable, bonus was a very large screen TV\u2026.my 8 year old was happy. No noise at night from the street, windows are double glazed. We were actually very happy. Continental breakfast was included, tea/coffee/hot chocolate, toast, cereal, juice and fruit, enough to start the day. Everything was going well until night 2 when we came back at 7.00pm.

To cut a very long story short this is the out come, stuff the other guests get me in or police will be called, found out it was illegal for them to touch or move our items to another room with out our permission, we did not accept the family room at that point out of principle, plus there were still large yellow water stains in the ceiling tiles and they were still wet, the guests in my room did give me access to \u201cthere\u201d room so I could access the safe, they actually saw the happenings in reception. I made the receptionist phone the manager, he said it was just a lack of communication, he would not come to the hotel to speak to me, he actually was never at the hotel during our 5 days, we were advised that even though the had given us 2 rooms we should just accept what we had booked, that was not happening, after more shouting, and proving it was illegal for the staff to move our items they gave us another 2 rooms, at the family rate. With the exception of the incident, I can say the Montana Hotel is a nice place to stay in a nice area, but after what had happened to my family, I will tell everyone to avoid the hotel like the plague, the staff are deceitful, liars, the manager/owner accepts no responsibility for the actions of his staff or his own.

There is nothing better than having a hot cappacino at Starbucks, when just arriving to London. The staff greeted us and were friendly throughtout our stay. They helped us considerably about how we should plan our stay as we only had four days and we wanted to visit and see the fast, exciting life of London. The room we had was located on the third floor facing the front, with a nice view overlooking view of Gloucester rd. The room was very clean and spacious and very warming. There was free wi-fi was which is extremely important for me as a working employer in a business to check my emails daily, so a fast wi-fi connection was provided. We booked a 2 day bus tour at the reception as it was well recommended for our stay and it lasted 48 hours and the bus visited all the historical places in London. We saw and went on the London Eye as hat was on our must-do list, which we enjoyed as it was a new experince. The tour also included a river cruise to Greenwich and a pub lunch, which was really good. We also wanted to go shopping as its every girls best hobby and interest. We were told to go to a shopping centre called Westfields, which is one of the biggest shooping centre in the whole of Europe. Westfields was only located a 20 minutes bus journey from the hotel. When we came back, we were just struggling to hold all the bags together as it was a shopping worthwhile. Overall, the customer service was really good as there was help available at all times.

While researching the possible hotel options we saw the mixed reviews on the Montana and thought we would give it a chance. I have stayed in some scummy motels and hotels before so we had no expectations for the Montana. I have been to London before and knew the area was fantastic so we didn't expect to spend any time in the hotel room at all. When we first got into the hotel it seemed very nice. No ones room was ready from our group so we were told to leave our bags in the back and go explore the area while we waited, which is exactly what we did. Two hours later when we returned from lunch we discovered that our room still wasn't ready. So we waited another hour and we finally were placed in a room. Now I have never seen a hotel with basement rooms but we were exhausted and willing to give it a chance. The room was very dirty and had only one window which was a fire exit. The sheets had black smears on them, the wall paper was torn, and the room felt like a storage area with all the extra furniture. But the reason we asked for a new room was the sewage smell. The bathroom was disgusting! The shower had brown sludge all over the base and walls and the toilet paper had black smears on it. Which was probably due to the towels, toilet paper and sheets being stored on the floor in the hallways outside the rooms. (A fact that we asked about at the front desk and were told that they never did, despite the pictures I had taken.) When we went upstairs to see if they had any other rooms, we were told that they had no openings and that we would have to ask the next day but they didn't think it would be possible. They also sent someone down to look at the bathroom, which proved to be useless. The man told us \"the smell was a mixture of perfume and cigarettes\" so we knew we were stuck in the room. Feeling a little used I decided to call Air Transat and see if there was anything they could do since we paid for a 5 star hotel and got a 2. Immediately after I had called Air Transat we got a call from the front desk saying that they had a room for us. We were moved to a room on the top floor which was much nicer than the first. The bathroom was clean and we had actual windows! From then on the staff were nice, unlike they were at the beginning. The front desk clerk told me when we were moved to \"immediately call Air Transat and tell them you are very happy with your room\" which I found a little weird since we hadn't even seen the room yet. But the next day as we walked downstairs we ran into another guest as he was yelling at the front desk clerk. Apparently he had gotten a room like our old basement room and had paid $500 for it. So we were happy to see that others were equally as disgusted by the shape of the rooms. But all in all after the first day and that horrible room mishap we had a very nice stay. If you ever stay here MAKE SURE you get a 4th floor room! They still store their linens on the floor in the hallways but somehow they seem to clean the rooms better. The breakfast is amazing and the wait staff is very nice! They always remembered our orders and never let our coffee's go empty. If you do stay here, stay for the area and not for the hotel! The tube is literally a 2 minute walk from the hotel and they have some good restaurants around for a quick snack along with a bakery, a grocery store and of coarse a couple of pubs!

I always like the excellent location right in Kensington and across from the Gloucester Road Tube. For the price, you really can't beat that location. This time I stayed in a room with two twin beds. We were fortunate to be put in a room on the back of the hotel, something that has never happened on my previous stays there. The back of the hotel over looks a mews and is MUCH quieter than the front side on the corner of Gloucester/Cromwell Roads. My complaints this time were with the cleanliness and size of the room. This is England, so I expected the rooms to be small but our bathroom was extremely tiny. I've stayed in other twin rooms at this hotel and they had much larger bathrooms compared to what we were given. You could basically only stand up in it and turn around and that's it. The shower had black mold growing in the corners and edges and I didn't really enjoy that but I put up with it since we were only staying for one night. My other problem was with the staff. Before we arrived they quoted me a discount rate and I had emails to confirm that I booked the room at that rate. They seemed hesitant to give it to me upon check-in and wanted to charge me more. They said I would have to bring it up upon check-out. That was annoying because for the next day I had to worry about it and keep reminding myself to bring it up with the staff again upon check-out. They seemed hesitant to give me the rate at check out again, and I had to pull out my paperwork to show them what they had quoted me and that I had reserved that rate. Finally they gave it to me. But, all the time they took and the questioning they gave me about how why they had quoted me that rate left a bad taste in my mouth. I would stay here again just because it is in a neighborhood that I like and because it includes free breakfast. But, just be aware that the rooms in this hotel vary significantly: you could end up with a larger and noisy room or a really small room like we had this time that is quieter. If I stayed again I would be sure to book the room well in advance (because the rooms were even cheaper much earlier on their website compared to the quote they gave me when I booked at a date closer to my arrival date), and I would be sure to bring all of your paperwork with you in case the front desk questions your booking.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cconvenient location\u201d", "Author": "tannythestar", "ReviewID": "UR85943562", "Content": "hotel looks really nice outside.

If you ask the locals if you could walk to Buckingham Palace or Trafalgar Square they will say it's a very far walk and they say to take the tube or taxi. From our perspective you don't see anything in the tube but one thing when you are on holidays and you have time it is a beautiful walk and it's only about 45 mins. to an hour to these areas.

The location is great. That alone makes it a great place to stay. A very safe and friendly neighborhood. The room I was in was 201. No great view but everything else was alright. Comfortable but not elegant. Oh and by the way the hair dryers are in the drawers. One member of our party when out and bought one before she found out where it was.. Minor complains are the soap is so small it is practically useless and the glass they they put in the bathroom is the only one. And yes the internet service downstairs that costs a pound for 20 minutes is not very good. I was able to access my email though. There is a grocery store in the mall to the right of the Gloucester Road tube stop entrance. I found their fruit to be very good and the price was similar to Walmart. And up the street 5 minutes there is a convenience store that sells all kinds of food that has really late hours. I believe it is called Tesco. The Red Leicester cheese there is excellent. Far better than any cheddar I've had here in the states. So make good use of those in room refrigerators. The pluses are the staff for the most part are very friendly. The little English guy with glasses seemed a bit off putting. The continental breakfast that is served in the mornings in their dining room is very good. I was served hot toast and coffee by the young oriental girls working there. Nice smiles and cute. The toast was the best I have ever had with a choice of jelly and preserves. The fruit that was cut was cantaloupe and honey dew melon. Coming from the states I expected it to be unripe and pretty much inedible. Boy was i surprised. It was excellent . Cereal and juices are also available at the bar. There is really no need to spend any money for breakfast. It was so good. A perfect way to start the day. And all of this on linen table clothes. A little more about the room. We had a single bed and a double bed in our room. My bed seemed to sleep nicely. It was a bit warm in the room but I put that up to my roommate who set the thermostat.. You might need to be a bit agile in getting in the tube for a shower. There is a bit of a step into the tube. So if you are a little bit iffy in the mobility department you may have trouble. But I am told that they don't know how to do showers in England so you may have this issue elsewhere. Our companions who were in room 106 said that their water was not hot. I did not get a full understanding of the exact nature of this problem. Let me recommend the Van Gogh exhibition at the Royal Academy of Art. for those that will be in London before April 17th. I think that's when it ends. It was amazing. I was told it would be an hour and a half wait to get in and I went on a Friday night about 6:00 and waited only 5 minutes Pay the extra few pounds and do the audio tour. The highlight of my trip! That and the wonderful people!

It was small but it was all we needed. I loved the layout. It was a narrow room with the ends of the single beds facing each other. The bathroom was a good size with a full-size tub and shower.

The last couple of times I've stayed in London, I was at another hotel in the same area where I was put in a dark, cramped, grimy room barely big enough for one single bed. But at the Montana, my room (number 311) was clean and bright, and spacious. The bathroom was small, but not uncomfortably so. I requested a tub, and it was large, with plenty of space for soaps and shampoos. As mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel does not provide shampoo, which is not an issue with me as I prefer my own brand. They did provide a small bar of soap and two towels. The soap and towels were replaced daily. There is a Boots and grocery store in the tube station shopping arcade across the street, where you can buy anything else you need. Another nice touch was the mirrored medicine cabinet and glass-holder built into the wall. There room had its own thermostat control, and the A/C worked very well. The room had a queen and a single bed, a large window overlooking a charming residential street behind the hotel, and more drawers and electrical outlets than I could use. The plugs are British-style only, so you'll need adapters if you're from another country. I bought a couple inexpensive ones at Boots. There was also a good-sized wardrobe, where the room safe was tucked away. I bought soda and pre-made sandwiches, and fruit from the nearby grocery stores, and kept them in the mini-fridge. This left me more money for shows and other attractions! The elevator is indeed small, but large enough for my friend and I to go up together with our (carry-on sized) bags. My first night there, I discovered that the bathtub drain was broken. I called it in the next morning, and the maintenance was there within the hour. He replaced the entire drain unit and it was perfect for the rest of my stay. He, and the rest of the staff, were very polite and friendly.

It's a straight shot from Heathrow airport on the Piccadilly line (both ways took me less than 30 minutes). The station is also served by Circle and District lines. The wide-screen TV was really nice, especially as it came with FREE music and movies on demand. Loved it. There was also a good variety of channels available, including the various BBC stations, ITV, Channel 5, and a few other cable choices. The TV also had a clock and wake-up alarm built into it, which you set with the remote control. The man at the front desk gave me a slip of paper with the wifi network key so I could use the free Internet. You have to set your connection to key index 2, which I suspect flummoxes some guests ... especially those with Macs using OSX, as it only supports key index 1! However, I was using a netbook with Windows XP and got hooked up without any problems. The connection was on the slow side, but perfectly adequate for checking e-mail and looking up addresses on Google maps. Basically, this hotel had everything I was hoping to find (great location, wifi, mini-fridge, A/C, safe, tub) and more! I'm very much looking forward to staying here again, next time I visit London.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location and lovely stafff\u201d", "Author": "Happy_Parsnips", "ReviewID": "UR30188634", "Content": "Stayed as a family with 2 small children in excellent family room with great flat screen tv, wifi, hairdryer, refreshment tray on request at reception, good bathroom.

Yes the elevator was small (me and my big bag only fit in it at one time) but we were on the second floor so walked up all the time.the hotel is only a 7 minute walk to Kensington Palace, Gardens and plenty of teen girl shopping nearby!! the breakfast was just toast and cereal and juice,tea etc but unlimited and good enough several mornings for us. We did 2 Golden bust tours from the hotel and were very happy with both the guides and the meals included. We arrived FRiday April 17 in the rain, then had perfect spring weather for the rest of the 10 days.On the Tuesday we travelled by train to Buxton to visit Chatsworth on the Wednesday, however, when we arrived at the Buckingham Hotel with nothing to do at 2 p.m. on Tuesday the front desk receptionist suggested a climb past the Poole caverns to something called Solomon's Temple. It was so worth it and my 18 year old daughter called this the best part of her entire trip. A small fort set high in with peak district surrounding you with magnificent views. Chatsworth was beautiful my personal favourite of the trip, a must see for all romantic English lovers.WE took the Eurostar to Paris on the Friday, the train was fine the Metro dirty and smelly, the Eiffel tower up the stairs was lovely though tiring ,walked from there to the Musee D'Orsay then the Louvre the on to the Notre Dame and back the same day to LOndon, finishing with high tea at the Orangery at Kensington Palace.

But at the Montana they're not even trying. I spent a hundred pounds a night for one of the worst hospitality experiences I have ever had. Just terrible value. So much is wrong with this place I don't even know where to start. Perhaps I should start with the good bits, as it's easier since there are only two: free wireless internet access and location. The location is very good, near the tube station, cafes, shops etc in a trendy part of town. Granted though, this may not be for everyone. While it may be good for people doing business in the area or even in central London, tourists may prefer to stay somwhere else closer to the main sights. But overall, I don't think you can fault this location. Now on the bad bits. The room is as warm and welcoming as guantanamo bay. It's old, tired, slightly smelly and extremely basic. The bathrrom was designed for very tiny people, the shower is pokey and the water pressure is so so. For 100 pounds all I got was some old soap by the way, so remember to bring everything else. The lift is small and slow and always stinks of something different (if it's not tobacco it's garlic or farts - it's just revolting). Staff at reception looks bored and uninspired. I asked for an iron and they said they were all out; didn't even volunteer to let me know when one was back. They always want your key when you leave the hotel, which I find annoying and unsafe. Breakfast entails tea or coffee, corn flakes, and four burnt slices of toast. For some extra money you could order something else but I didn't dare! The restaurant area looked very unwelcoming, and the table cloths looked like they've been there since world war 2. Anyway, I could go on forever.

In three visits, we have never had any trouble with check-in or cleanliness of the room. Sometimes the staff has been more friendly than others, but never inattentive. This is NOT a luxury hotel. Views from the windows consist mainly of rooftops and urban landscape, and the elevator is small and a bit creepy, which has inspired us to get a bit more exercise on the stairs.

This small, charming hotel is located within easy walking distance from the Gloucester Road Underground Station with small restaurants, shops and several major museums nearby. Thus we had easy access to public transit for travel about the city as well as places to visit on foot such as the Victoria and Albert Museum, Science Museum and Museum of Natural History. Our rooms were aesthetically attractive with up to date conveniences including internet access, flat screen TV with movie/music choices, small fridge, safe box , air conditioning and adequate closet and storage spaces. Our accommodations were kept exceptionally clean and comfortable by the housekeeping staff. Room prices include a continental breakfast of cereal, toast & jam plus beverages with options for more extensive breakfasts. Meals are served in an attractive dining room which in the eveinings caters to hotel guests as well as others offering delicious Indian cuisine. There is also a small lounge and bar just off the hotel foyer, with a friendly and wonderfully funny bar keep. Though the hotel was almost fully booked when we walked through their doors, the staff went out of their way to find us rooms for that first evening and then, to enable us to depart for our scheduled activities early the next day, moved our luggage to different rooms for the remainder of our stay. The kindness and generosity of the staff cannot be elaborated on enough, from how the day clerk we first met responded to our situation with sympathy while making our stay possible, to the night clerk whom we came to consider as a wonderful new friend. He answered many questions, helping us learn about the city and use the public transit system with ease. At the end of our stay he even carried our bags to the Underground platform we needed for our return trip to Heathrow. If a giant establishment with swimming pools and grand ball rooms is what you want then look elsewhere.

Great location just across the road from Gloucester Road Tube Station and literally everything you need on your doorstep - plenty of cafes, restaurants, Waitrose, Boots the Chemist and Tesco Express, Post office and Bureaux de Change also opposite and just a few mins walk from Natural History Museum and the Victoria & Albert Museum. I've rated The Montana above average mainly because of the size of the rooms which I gather are usually tiny in London, and we also found the staff quite friendly and helpful. We had a refurbished room No. 101, which although we requested a double, was a triple. It was at the back of the hotel looking out into a service yard so not much of a view, but at least it was a quiet room with little traffic noise. Room size was good with spacious newly tiled bathroom, new carpets and curtains, flat screen T.V. , room safe, reasonable standard furniture and comfortable clean beds, no tea & coffee making facilities, but an empty fridge for you to put your own drinks in. Decor ok, but bit dingey and some things left unrefurbished in the bathroom which let it down a bit. The continental breakfast (served in their Indian Restaurant) included within the price was ok, pretty basic with tea/coffee, juice, bran flakes or cornflakes, toast, butter and jams. No fruit or ham and cheese, but you could have a cooked breakfast if you paid \u00a35.50 extra. We had dinner in Pizzeria Organic, literally a few doors down Gloucester Road opposite the Tube Station - good reasonable meal with 20% discount if you take along one of the maps with a special code from the reception in the Montana. Can't comment on the bar in the hotel or the Indian Restaurant as we didn't get chance to use either, but they both looked nice enough. All in all, a pleasant stay in a usually expensive part of London. One thing that did puzzle me though was that we booked on the hotel website internet rates which we imagined would be cheaper, but the hotel had 2 signs displayed outside - one saying rooms from \u00a339 and the other saying \u00a355. I assumed that those would be for the unrefurbished rooms, but when we asked at reception they said all their rooms were now refurbished.

I paid only 39 pounds per night (but had a room without it's own bathroom). I had a sink in the room, a single bed and went down the hall for toilet and shower. I did not wait once to get into the shower and found the hotel overall to be very clean. My sheets were crisp, white and clean and the sink was always scrubbed and shining. My twin bed was brand new. While it was definitely a bit of a pain and inconvenience to walk down the hall to the bathroom, and I did have to go through a door and down some steps, the price made it worth it.

Some of these reviews complain about the white toast for breakfast but, hey, it was included in my low rate, was delivered hot and quickly. After the second day there, the staff remembered that I take coffee, not tea and always greeted me with a smile and a pleasant attitude. The only complaint I would have is that the hotel is undergoing a remodel. The hallways were full of carpentry supplies and they were trying out different types of stain on the woodwork, etc. The carpet in my room was ripped.

I stayed at the Montana with my husband for 4 weeks in Oct 2005, and we enjoyed it so much we are staying there again later this year. We booked over the internet after a really long search for a decent hotel at a decent price in a good local in London. Although I had read good reveiws about the hotel I wasn't holding my breath, after all seeing is beleiving. Well we weren't dissapointed and in fact were pleasantly surprised. The reception/bar and dining room were all spotlessly clean. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The continental brekky of toast ( 2 slices each), jam/marmalade, coffee/tea & OJ was enough for us even though it doesn't sound like alot. If you prefer you can order more substantial food for an extra cost but in 4 weeks we didn't bother. toast and coffee is about all we have at home anyway and if you get sick of the spreads BYO. Our room was great, much bigger than we expected. We had room 411 with a double and single bed, small dining table, a nice wardrobe with in room safe and dressing table. There was no tea/coffee facilities in the room which was a shame. The beds were comfy and the linen clean. The bathroom wasn't huge but was roomy enough for my 6ft 2 husband to use without complaining. There was a shower over the bath, toilet and basin with a nice big mirror hiding a nice big cabinet above the basin. The hot water was always hot but the pressure could've been a bit better. We had clean towels and the beds were made every day and the room was really quiet, we had a window that opened onto a quiet mews type area. Yes the lift is small but so what, your only in it a few minutes and if you can't wait for the next one there is always the stairs to keep you healthy. The morning we checked in, we arrived really early (6am) and our room wasn't ready till much later (our fault not theirs). We were invited to leave our bags and relax in the bar/sitting area until the dining room opened when we could have brekky. Well we left our bags and headed out to explore the immediate area in the quite of early morning, it was terrific. ok nothing was open but it was london just waking up so it was pretty special and Hyde Park was wonderful. The only suggestion I would make to improve the hotel is to find a secure area for people to leave their luggage. It was in a corner of the bar/sitting area not visible to the reception staff but easily accessible to anybody else. The dining room that serves brekky in the morning turns into an Indian rest for lunch and dinner and we had dinner there one night and found the food was delicious if a bit pricey but then I've found all indian food is pricey (must be all those expensive spices) and it was pretty comparable to other rests nearby. The Montana's location is just great, walking distance to Harrods, Kensington Palace, Hyde Park, and the V&A and Natural History Museums as well as High St Kensington and Earls Court. Across the road is a post office, Gloucester Rd tube, a bureau de change (or equal). Next to the tube is a small shopping centre with a few restaurants, a Boots chemist, and a Waitrose supermarket. There are lots of other cafe's near by as well as a starbucks. Our highlights were the steak rest and a small itlaian place almost across the road. I think the steak rest was called Blue Fire or something Fire. Also within walking distance was another supermaket Tesco's and a couple of laundymats. We hit the supermarkets every day to buy our lunch of ready made sandwiches or salad or fruit. We found this a much cheaper option than cafes or other sandwich sellars. The sangers were always fresh and had a really wide range of fillings available. For dinner if we couldn't be bothered eating out we'd go to waitrose and head to the deli counter at the back of the store. Next to the deli they had a hot food section where you buy the normal BBQ chicken but also cooked ham hocks, roast duck etc. but just a litlle further along was the counter that sold a huge range cooked ready to eat indian foods. snacks like samosa's & Kebabs, at least 2 types of curry and rice, if it wasn't already hot they would heat it for you. Buy yrself a couple of plastic plates and knifes forks etc and bob's your uncle, your all set.

After using a few nights browsing hotel reviews on sites like Tripadvisor we ended up in booking the Hotel Montana via the Hotel-assist -service. The main reason was the absolutely great location in the Kensington area and near the main tube lines. Just about 45 minutes directly to the Heathrow terminals and a quarter to most of the city attractions (including Harrod's...) We also spent lots of time in the nearby museums (Natural History and Science just about one block away.) Just one note; the Tube in London is not always so reliable and prompt in operation than in some other European metropolis. Leave some time margin if you need to be somewhere at a certain time. We did not expect too much for the hotel and we were not disappointed at all. The Net reservation went smoothly (I checked it by phone a couple of days before arrival, just to be sure.) We arrived quite early (10 am) and found our room to be ready. Unfortunately my \"confirmed\" wishes for a quiet twin bed room have disappeared somewhere and the (very polite) front desk persons promised a twin bed room to be ready in the afternoon. We left our luggage on the small corner on the left side of the front desk hoping they would be safe there. After a long and busy day we arrived to our new room in the third floor (number 305 if memory serves.) It was bigger than we had excepted. See the attached pictures. The age of the building is visible in many details like in the (double) windows, which had so many layers of paint that they had difficulties in shutting completely, tilted floors, some wear and tear everywhere and a marginal sound isolation between rooms. These are common features in old European city hotels. Really nothing to write home about. Just get adjusted to them or pay some more. The room and the not-too-big bathroom were both well cleaned (daily, as it appeared to be). No bad smells or anything like that. A working (but maybe a bit small) shower, new bar of soap and clean towels. What else do you except. The Gloucester road in not a very silent one and after one night slept with earplugs we asked if there were any courtside rooms available. The hotel was quite occupied but we got a new room in the basement of the building. During the next day our belongings were transferred to room 520. This was a bit smaller but apparently refurbished more recently (or maybe used less) than the third floor room. Everything was really clean and tidy. This room had a combined shower / bath tub. See pictures of this facility, too. There was no \"view\" whatsoever, but we had not asked for one. Otherwise this room was everything we had hoped for. Temperature was fine and the room really was so silent that it was difficult to believe we were in the middle of a big city. We really slept very well there. In a hotel without air-conditioning the basement would have been the preferred choise anyway. Fortunately the heat wave had ended a week earlier and the weather was more typical for the season again. As some other quests have noted the breakfast repeats itself but the service was prompt and very polite, even personal, I would say. Many thanks to the waiter. He really helped us to start the day in a good mood. Of course one should also note that the breakfast is included in the price. If some wishes were allowed here, some cereals would be a great plus. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are lots of places to eat in the neighborhood when you just cannot take any more tea and toast. We did not test the indian reastaurant at the hotel, so cannot say anything about it. Instead we used the restaurants in the shopping mall near the Tube station. Liked especially the Garfunkels there. As our return flight departed quite late in the evening we were allowed to leave our luggage in the hotel after checkout. This time they were tagged with our personal data and taken out of sight to a separate storage area. Fetching them later in the afternoon on our way to the airport went very smoothly. Many thanks to the (quite international) hotel personnel, especially to the maids for their excellent cleaning work and to the front desk men for their helpfulness. Good work. London is a rather expensive city, especially when it comes to the hotels.

Overall our stay was ok. There were 3 of us sharing a triple room, which consisted of 3 single beds. However, although I'd requested a room on the 1st or 2nd floor, our room was located in the basement. It looked out onto a tiny (6ft x 6ft) courtyard with a storage room for chemicals which the staff would access several times during the morning/evening. So there was no view and we could only barely see the sky. I had also requested a non-smoking room but there was an ashtray in the room and cigarette burns on the net curtains and bedspreads. The carpets were stained. While the toilet, basin and bath were clean there were significant dampness stains on the bathroom ceiling. There was a very stale smell when we entered the room which prompted one of my fellow travellers to buy some air freshener to use in the room. However due to the courtyard outside we kept the window closed during the day to prevent anyone accessing the room. The hotel has an Indian restaurant so at 9:30 every night the smell of food from the kitchen would waft into the room so again we had to close the window. Therefore the room was incredibly warm; daytime temperatures were in the mid 20s Celsius and it was difficult to sleep due to the heat. The television was very small and had no teletext but range of channels was ok. The elevator is tiny as per previous reviews. It took 3 of us (squashed) or only 2 of us with bags. We had to ask for a kettle and it arrived while we were out of the room so it only included 2 cups. So I asked for a third cup which came relatively quickly. Tea, coffee, sugar and UHT milk were provided. However on another occassion we asked if there was a scissors we could borrow but there was none available in reception and there wasn't really any effort made to find one for us. Our reservation included continental breakfast. At breakfast we were shown to a table, and served orange juice (which I liked but might be weak for some tastes). We were then given a choice of tea or coffee and 2 slices of white toast each. The toast was perfectly cooked and always arrived hot. The service was polite and very prompt, and the server remembered our choices of tea/coffee on the second day. However, I was expecting cereal but it transpired that this would have cost an extra \u00a31.50 per person. The room was cleaned daily and we were given 3 fresh towels and soap. However one point to note is that on Saturday the maid was already cleaning our room when we returned from breakfast at around 8.30. Our room (570) was adjacent to the bathroom of the adjoining room. We could hear our neighbour singing in the shower and also the flush of the toilet. On checking-out we were allowed to leave our luggage but it was in an area just outside the reception desk so I must admit being a bit concerned about how easy it would have been for someone to run off with it. However it was all fine when we came to collect it. I would only recommend this hotel if you are on a semi-restricted budget and are not too fussy about luxuries. Next time I would prefer to pay more and have a higher standard room. In summary, good points: 1) Location of the hotel - literally cross the street for the tube station, some caf\u00e9s/restaurants/fast food outlets and some small supermarkets 2) We arrived at 11:30 approx and were allowed to check in early. 3) Juice, tea and toast at breakfast Bad points: 1) Location of the room in the basement 2) Overall condition of the room 3) The heat especially at night and having to keep the window closed meant very little fresh air 4) Smells from the kitchen", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Plaines, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice for me!\u201d", "Author": "sue7778", "ReviewID": "UR5698849", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay at the Montana Hotel! I was a little leery when I made my reservation. I was booking a single room with the bathroom down the hall. I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived. My room had both a toilet and a sink. I only needed to go down the hall for showers. The room was basic and had everything I might need. The room contained a single bed, TV, phone, desk, place to store clothes (both a dresser and armoire), toilet and sink. There was one bath size towel in the room and a small bar of soap; that was enough for me. The room was a little worn (bedspread needed replacing), however, it was very clean and had plenty of air and light. Even though there was an elevator, my room was between floors and I always had to take some stairs up or down. I only had a carry-on and a backpack, so this posed no problem for me. I also had to go up half a flight, down the hall, and down half a flight to get to the restroom. This also was not a problem for me, however, it might be for some people. This configuration, I believe is only for single rooms; most rooms required taking no stairs after getting off the elevator. I stayed at the Montana for a total of 4 days; 2 days at the beginning of my trip and 2 days at the end. I was very pleased that they remembered me from my initial stay and greeted me like an old friend. It was a very nice homecoming! I found the staff to be very accomodating, friendly, and kind in all my interactions with them. The Montana is in the process of refurbishing the rooms. Rooms in Europe are not large and prices are high. This is a very clean, basic, lower priced hotel, which is what I was looking for. If you are looking for more, you might be disappointed. I am reviewing it and rating it based on these facts. I only had breakfast once and it was a pleasurable experience. It took longer than I like to spend on breakfast, plus I had to leave before breakfast started on 2 of my 4 days (to catch a train and a plane), so I only ate breakfast there once. It was fine for toast, juice, and tea. Okay way to start the day. You had to wait for the waitress to bring the breakfast and it took 20 minutes or so. You could order extra items, such as a full English Breakfast, at additional cost. The hotel is across the street from a tube stop (on two lines). There is also buses that stop here (don't know which lines).There is a bakery, supermarket, convenience market, restaurant, and drugstore (Boots--like a Walgreens) all within half a block of the hotel. There are also about 3 banks also within half a block of the hotel. The hotel has a computer with internet access in the lobby. I used an internet cafe about 2 or 3 blocks away, as I had to do some printing. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cWe Cancelled Reservation for End of Trip & Stayed Elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "sylvanandmilton", "ReviewID": "UR5530771", "Content": "The Hotel Montana was half a block from the Gloucester tube station.

Although it isn't a luxurious hotel, it is fine for coming back to after a day of being out in the city. I returned to london in May and June of 2006 and booked 2 weeks at the Montana again. I am a student and I have found that the Montana hotel is the most affordable place in London besides hostels (which are usually very dirty and overcrowded in London). I called the hotel directly to book my reservation and they gave me a single room with a bathroom down the hall for 35 pounds a night, with the 7th night free. This is a very good deal for london, considering that breakfast is included too. The breakfast of toast and coffee or tea does get old very quickly though. I wish they would add some cold cereals or muffins or something else to the menu as well. The rooms can be a bit noisy if you are on the side that looks over gloucester road or cromwell road. I only found the noise to be a problem my first night there, after that I adjusted to it. Each room is cleaned well and is supplied with a towel and a bar of soap. Bring your own washcloth and shampoo because they do not supply them. I personally think that the staff at the hotel are very friendly and accomodating. I became very ill on the day I was supposed to fly to London and I had to change my flight to a few days later. This meant I would not be able to check into the Montana when I was supposed to in less than 24 hours. They usually require 48 hours notice for cancelling but they let me change my reservations with less than 24 hours notice at no charge. I booked a week at the Montana in June as well and at first they did not have any single rooms available so I would have had to pay a higher price. But when I arrived at the hotel I found that they had done some rearranging and they managed to get me into the cheaper single room. A lot of people on here seem to complain about the lack of space in the rooms but i found my room to be very spacious even though in America it would be smaller than some people's walk in closets. I don't know what people need all the space for. The rooms definitely provide enough space for luggage, a sink, a bed, dresser, and a tv. They all have windows too, which surprisingly not every hotel room in London has.

We needed a cheap hotel for our last night in London and we liked the Gloucester Road area. They quoted us a price of 75 pounds and my husband bargained the rate down to 65 pounds. Our room was larger than I expected for a budget hotel. It had a double bed and also a twin bed. The down side was the bathroom was the size of a closet but it was clean and there was plenty of hot water. Also, the bed was extremely hard but it was okay for one night. Breakfast was included in the rate. The free breakfast consisted of coffee, tea or juice and toast. Anything else was extra but the free breakfast was adequate. Would probably stay there again if nothing else was available mainly because I liked the area.", "Date": "November 21, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Heidelberg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "forensicsgirl", "ReviewID": "UR2825374", "Content": "We stayed at The Montana for 3 nights.
