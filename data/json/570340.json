Upon reading the reviews, I thought I'd give it a shot. We stayed in Hotel Silla for 6 nights and it was good! The room may be small and no breakfast was included in the price. But it located in a good and safe neighbourhood with lots of nearby cafes and restaurants. It was also a stone's throw away from the Metro and a 5 min walk to the Vatican City. The hotel was clean and we totally enjoyed our stay there. There was a patisserie just down below and we woke up every morning to the lovely smell of whatever they were baking downstairs! I give it top marks for location too! Just a little note. If you need air-conditioning, you'll have to pay extra. The show area is really, really tiny, so not advisable if you are really huge. It can be a little noisy if you have rooms facing the courtyard cos the patisserie opens quite early. There's free wifi but can be a little dodgy. Other than that, it was great! The hotel recommended us a typical roman trattoria just down the road called Ragno D'oro. It serves amazing local, homecooked dishes. And we reckon the food's really good cos it was packed EVERY NIGHT with locals! We went back there almost every day of our stay in Rome! Good recommendation!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Croydon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell located hotel in pleasant neighbourhood with very helpful, friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "SallyandRichard_10", "ReviewID": "UR81079958", "Content": "We have just stayed in Hotel Silla for 9 days and really enjoyed our time there.

Although we had visited Rome on previous occasions, we were never really satisfied with our accomodations. Not so this time around! We lucked out and found this fantastic little hotel, Hotel Silla, about 200 meters from St. Peter's Square and Castel Sant'Angelo, one of the prettiest places in Rome. The hotel is situated on the second and third floors of a building on Silla road, just a few steps away from the Ottaviano Subway stop. It is a small, family run hotel which added to its charm. The staff were very friendly and were always ready to offer advice if asked. The room we had was immaculately clean and well appointed with a double bed, an in-room safe, a generous bathroom and air conditioning if we wanted it. It was also very quiet (hard to find a quiet room in Rome!) as our room faced the inner courtyard of the building. The hotel does provide breakfast for a small additional charge. This hotel is perfect for those people that want a nice place to stay for a reasonable price.

Given our late booking and high season prices, everything in town was ridiculously expensive. The Hotel Silla was a good compromise. We paid 135 euros/night for a room with two twin beds. That's pretty high for what the place was worth, but probably about right in the completely inflated market. The room was very clean, had a TV, wardrobe, desk table, and two chairs. The bathroom was pretty spacious for an Italian bathroom, though the shower was small (I've experienced smaller in Italy) and the towels were closer to paper towels than soft fluffy towels. The mattresses and pillows were harder than I'd like. Our room was on the \"second\" floor (third, in American-ese), with two flights of steps to reach it and no elevator. The steps were shorter than normal, if that makes sense, and not too hard to navigate with my heavy suitcase. We could've chosen a \"first\" floor room one flight up, but it was having hot water problems. Our room overlooked a courtyard, off of which was a bakers' production shop so our room always smelled wonderful. It did a little noisy first thing in the morning when the bakers showed up for work but was pretty quiet at night. There was no A/C. All of the receptionists were very nice and spoke English. They arranged a car to take us to the airport (47 euros) and gave us restaurant recommendations and a corkscrew when we needed one. The hotel was a block from the Ottaviano metro and an easy walk to the Vatican. Lots of great shops and restaurants nearby. At these prices, I wouldn't recommend this hotel as your first choice, but it's not a bad place to stay and the location is great.", "Date": "June 5, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Silla", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d570340-Reviews-Hotel_Silla-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$92 - $197*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Silla 3</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00192</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "570340", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/1/8/9/2/102981/102981.jpg"}}
