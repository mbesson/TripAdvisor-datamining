It is in fact very small and when we were there very crowded with just a few sunbeds, so you had to lay on the ground. They rent it out for parties so it was closed on friday and saterday at 18.00 which would have been a perfect time to visit it after a long hot day in madrid. So if you can avoid the weekend. The parties are very loud and go on until about 4 in the morning. In the old building you can here that very well. Location is very good, easy acces with metro from airport and you're right in the centre of Madrid. Gran via is about 2 minutes walk and the royal palace about 5. Breakfast is very expensive 16 euros. That's more than most of the daily specials (about 9-11 euros)! There are more hotels in the area that don't have parties at night so you'll sleep better.

This is nothing serious and is just part of the ageing process but at this fast rate, if hotel management does nothing about it then by next year, thing will be falling apart! Example: the shower is stylish but the shower mechanism is probably not suited for hotel use since it was snapping off place; hallways do reveal how some hotel guests are careless in carrying their luggage. There is also public parking adjacent to the hotel but do remember that any central Madrid parking is quite expensive! On the positive side I would have to say that the location (5m walk from Puerta del Sol) is one of its strong point. Do however take some care if walking around the hotel late at night.

Unfortunately, there are areas of the hotel under renovation and during the day is not quite pleasant to hear the drilling machines (since the weather was fine most of the day I was out, except few breaks for rest). The reception staff was OK but a little work and training should be done with the staff covering the service at the rooms (forget to knock at the door, checking the minifridge with the guest in the room, etc). Also as I requested to iron a shirt, the iron table was brought after more than 30 min when I already gave up for self-ironing and asked for laundry service at reception desk (the delivery of the shirt is only next day, no emergency service available). The hotel has two towers and some of the facilities/rooms are under reneovation. The room interior is rather old fashion (something that 1980's) but clean and comfortable. The choice for TV stations is limited, just few in other language than spanish. With improvements related to renovation, TV facilities and staff training would have been a very good location.

On arrival there was not even a basic level of customer service, we had to wait until the members of staff on the desk decided we were worth talking to and gave us our room keys and told us where to go. There was no mention of the pool, or restaurant. We found our own way to a room in 'Tower B' which involved (as other people have said) taking the lift to the second floor then crossing over to the un-rennovated part of the building. Our room was right at the far end of tower B so we had to lug our own bags down a long dusty corridor, trying to avoid cabling strung across the way and the disgusting smells wafting out of rooms which were being completely gutted with the doors left open, while work men pushed past us with buckets of concrete. By the time we'd got to the room we had already decided to turn back as paying guests should to have to walk through such a mess to get to their rooms. We went to reception and began to complain, however Im sure the staff had heard this many times before, as they were completely non-apologetic and lacking in any normal kind of response and were waiting for us with their standard answer \"the room is non-refundable\". As we were only in Madrid for 5 days and had come solely for the purpose of relaxing, we decided not to waste our time arguing and just pay the additional charge for an upgrade to the new part of the building. We were however informed that we could only upgrade for our first 2 nights as the new rooms were fully booked after this. We stayed in a decent room for the first two nights (I would not call it 4 star worthy) before we had to check out on the 3rd day to change rooms, and were moved to a room in tower B not far from the lifts. The room was pretty shabby but we were willing to put up with it until we went to turn on the air con only to find there was no aircon unit - it had been ripped out leaving a dirty hole in the wall! Down to reception we went to complain, only for the member of staff to say he would send a technician. After a few minutes of trying to explain that there was no air con unit at all, I showed him a picture of the hole and loose wires and he finally understood, and seemed to be pretty shocked - just shows neither the staff nor management know whats happening in their hotel! We were moved to a room next to the previous one, with a double bed even despite being told earlier that there were no doubles available and we would have to make do with twins. The new room was satisfactory, and we stayed here one night until we had been for a swim the next day and went back to our room to freshen up only to find there was no water. Reception informed us it would be back on in 15 mins which it was, but it was filthy dirty and orange! Another strong complaint to reception got us our first apology of our stay, along with our final night's stay in a nice 'corner' room and breakfast free of charge. Its a shame, given the location and facilities this hotel could be quite a nice place to stay even with the rennovations happening, however due to the lack of management common sense and customer service this is an appalling place to stay!", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cvery good location\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR118775812", "Content": "I can realy recommend this hotel because of very good location in the heart of Madrid.

The bathroom was nice too & the shower was funny (the right wall was actually a window directly overlooking the street but with obviously a system preventing people to see inside). The buffet breakfast was expensive but it was worth it: A lot of choice with quality items in a nice room (designed as a sort of wine cellar with soft lights). The Minus: The 2nd room was located in the old part of the hotel which is being renovated (which means noisy from 8 am!). It was very small and old with no windows. Awfull! The parking (beware if you have a full size car as the parking lots are small!) was amazingly expensive: 30 euros per night! In addition I was not able to pay when checking out and had to find cash as credit cards were not accepted. I prepaid my stay several months ahead when I booked my rooms on the Accord website. However when checking out, I was told only the 1st room was paid. Despite a printed copy of the booking form stating I already paid the whole stay, I had to connect on the internet on my bank website to print out the bank statement proving I had been charged already. Very unpleasant for me and unprofesionnal from them. At the end, it is a bit of mixed feeling (hence the average rating): We would have only had the 1st room - and despite the error related to the payment - I would have kept an excellent souvenir of this stay.

The \"mini bar\" was a small refrigerater that just plugged into the wall with the tv overhead (no console or cabinet to hide wires). They had a bidet. I would have been depressed to have been staying in this room. The carpeting was spotted and old. We showed them our room but since we had a superior and they were paying for standard, I guess that is why they were given the room they were given.

As far as my stay and room there, the bed was comfortable, we had enough storage in the closet (considering this is European hotel!), and it was clean and new.

Don't order food or drink because it is so expensive (the lifeguard gets it for you). The water was cold, but refreshing on hot days. The breakfast was included for us, and it was very fulfilling. The restaurant is very nice. Meats, different breads and cereals, yogurts, fruits (cut up as well as whole), croissants that were of variety, cheeses, pastries and churros and great selection of juices or water and coffee/tea/hot chocolate. Very pleased with the offerings there. The hotel is in an excellent location. We shopped at the vendors outside. We ate breakfast and then had drinks at the cafe across the street.

We had checked with our travel agent, who advised us that the hotels had now merged to become the Mercure, but part of the hotel, (the Best Western section), was older and had a separate entrance at the rear of the hotel- now a connecting corridor. Out colleagues would be at the old Best Western and we would be in the Mercure part of the hotel. We all checked in. Our colleagues were shown to the rear of the hotel, and the connecting corridor, to the old part of the hotel-the Best Western. Imagine our disappointment, on specifically reserving rooms in the Mercure part of the hotel, to be also sent to the Best Western part. My room had also been used by a smoker. We returned to the desk and explained we had booked Mercure and not Best Western. We were ignored and simply given non smoking rooms in the Best Western section of the hotel. Had I not specifically booked a better Mercure room, rather than the Best Western with Breakfast, I would not have complained, but my booking was for Mercure. My colleagues paid less per night for the same standard room and also received breakfast, whilst I had paid more without breakfast - I am very disappointed. I also asked our agent to check the two hotels and following her investigations, the Best Western was at the rear of the hotel and is the older part and the Mercure at the front with better rooms and facilities. Our expectations were that we had booked the better Mercure part of the Hotel and not Best Western.
