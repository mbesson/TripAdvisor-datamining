There are lots of windows that provide natural light during a sunny day unfortunately the days we went it was cloudy and rainy. I'm a makeup artist who had two clients to do while there and had to do my clients faces inside the bathroom because that was the only place with normal lighting. That sucked.

Checked into room, it was spacious and clean with decent facilities, and the decor is alright. Got a double queen room - okay, I'd booked a king, but no real biggie. Go to check out the view - very disappointing, all you can see is like an internal ventilation chamber to the building, with no view whatsoever and little light getting down there; many rooms must be like this as you can look across into a number of other rooms spread around the chamber. Frankly the window may as well be bricked in. Given I'd booked here partly to get a view over the city on my first and possibly only ever visit, this was a letdown. Some rooms must get some sort of view as from the pool area on the top deck you can see quite far. Perhaps the rooms should be charged at a different rate. Some other issues. Some slop, looked like a milkshake or something, spilled down the footstool. Surely this could be cleaned, but if not it probably should be removed from the room. Either way there's a bit of a problem there. An in-room safe is provided, but to use it you get billed an extra $3 a day - okay not a lot, but it's annoying when places like this nickel-and-dime on those types of things. Some places I've stayed in for half to a third this price provide safes for free. Same thing on the breakfast - it can be purchased at around $13 extra plus tax and tip.

The room decoration is very uninspiring and it's almost as if they found the most \"commercial\" furniture available. The mattress firming dial was broken as was my toilet. I do have to say that the hotel addressed the toilet issue immediately. The location is in the heart of the business district and away from the French Quarter which I appreciated but still only a short walk when I wanted to restaurants in that area at night.

The only downside is the valet parking requirement running 26 dollars per night. We only used our car a couple of times when it was raining so the rest of the time it sat in the hotel's garage. The hotel rooms are clean and neat, the beds are fine and the flat screen tv's with many channel options make the room a respite at the end of the evening. Complimentary wifi worked well and we found that a plus. There is a small outdoor pool with chairs tables, and standing ashtrays as well as a small but high quality gym, which we used on the top floor of the hotel. Each floor has ice machines and each room has a microwave and small refrigerator. I asked our cleaning lady for extra regular coffee and none of the decaf and she was great at remembering them each of the days of our stay. The hotel has a small bar and restaurant on the 11th floor near the registration desk. We did not use either of these so I cannot speak to the quality of either service. The hotel is very secure and you cannot access the floors above the 11th without placing your room key into the slot on the elevator. You must also use your room key to enter the gym and to exit the door leading to the outdoor pool and rooftop seating area. (So just a note: Ask for an extra room key at check-in in case you misplace one, and make the effort to have your room key on you at all times!) The Hilton Garden Inn is just a couple of blocks to the west of Canal St. (a main north-south street separating the French Quarter - Bourbon St. from the Business district) and the main action of Bourbon Street and the shopping opportunities, restaurants and clubs of the French Quarter. It is also located just a block north of St. Charles St. and two blocks north of Magazine St. both offering shopping and foodie options. We purchased a 3 day metro pass at the kiosk on Canal St. just down the way from our hotel and we were able to use it for both the trolleys and buses. At the start of our 6-day vacation, we took the Canal St. trolley north to the RTA (public transportation) offices to pick up a map of the bus routes which cannot be found anywhere else on the system. The trolley is limited to 3 lines so it is easy to figure out without the map; however to fully use the bus system options you need this map. (The online version is not that useful for viewing the whole layout at once!) We could easily pick up the Canal St. or Charles St. trolleys within minutes from our hotel. A Magazine St. bus can take you down Magazine St. (from Canal St.) to the World War II Museum and beyond. There is a CVS which sells some food products and spirits as well as beer and other sundries within a 6 minute walk from the hotel, at the corner of Canal. (Be aware there is virtually no paperback fiction section at this CVS, although there are a small number of magazines and non-fiction books available.) Once on Canal there is additionally a Walgreen's a couple of blocks away as well as many restaurants and stores. If you are looking to purchase literature to read while on vacation we did pass a privately owned bookstore on a walk down Decatur St. heading from Canal St. east. There you will also find many clothing and decorative arts stores as well as restaurants including Cafe du Monde, a definite must stop, on your tour of New Orleans. All in all our vacation using the Hilton Garden Inn as a base was a success. We felt comfortable and safe there and enjoyed the facilities. There are washing machines and dryers on certain floors but we did not use them. The rooms are comfortable though not particularly special in any way. Everything was kept clean. We were able to walk to the Arena for a pro basketball game north and west of the hotel, and we were able to walk to trolleys and connecting buses to get to everywhere else we wanted to explore in the city. I can strongly recommend a stay at this hotel and I suggest you go onto their website to check on promotional deals they offer (like the stay 3 or more days including a Sunday offer) to make the cost more affordable and to offset the exorbitant garage fees which by the way are fairly standard for hotels in the center of New Orleans.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore", "Title": "\u201cThey always treat you well\u201d", "Author": "crt1966", "ReviewID": "UR126781437", "Content": "I travel to New Orleans about 7 or 8 times a year and always stay at the HGI on Gravier. its an excellent central locations with its own parking garage attached (parking is not great downtown NOLA). its only a few blocks from Bourbon street so you can walk back if you have had a few too many (who hasnt on Bourbon street) they have a nice restuarant with good food and room service is quick and easy.

We must first thank the front desk staff, we wrote cards for almost all of them. The bellman \"King\" was a walking wikapedia about NOLA everything, every place he sent us too was perfect. We came with a list of sites, and dinning spots to go to, he scratched out half of them. This guys knows cooks, chefs, and managers of almost every hot spot in town. It was great that every major attraction, or site was within walking distance or a short drive away. The breakfast each morning was good, with lots of choices, included in the rates. We had a great view of the city from the 16th floor, it was nice to not have the city noise, because the hotel guest rooms start at the 12th floor. Our only complaint would be that we wish the pool was a bit larger, but the rooftop pool was cool.

It is off from canal street where you can catch streetcar but it is not directly in the happening parts where you see photos off since it is a high rise and the French quarter is more low rise buildings. It defiantly beats places like scummy model 6 and super 8 but just not as nice as a Hilton should be. No balcony but nice high rise. Roof top pool was very small and not that clear of swimming pool water which was also disappointing, did not look refreshing to jump into. On pool balcony there was a loose piece to the fencing around it so watch little kids very carefully. No room service for breakfast or lunch just dinner which was bad. Food in restaurant was good. Not a fancy place, just a cafe beside the check in counter. TV in room was old, not even a flat screen. I know the TV really does not matter just complaining since it was a Hilton.

It is only about two blocks from canal and the french quarter. it is great for trips on bourbon street. On this most recent stay, I had a good experience and all of my needs where met. This stay i was really impressed with the service I recieved from the hotel staff. Upon arrival, I valet'd my car but had lots of luggage due to work equipment for a convention. One of the valet's took half of my stuff to check in and then to my room with me. It was very helpful. Later on my stay, I was waiting in the lobby for a friend and sparked up a great conversation with a hotel employee named King. King overheard me speaking of a steakhouse we were going to that night. King pulled out his Iphone and showed me the best way to get there, then offered some advice on other good dining options. We also had a great conversation on some of the great chef's in the area. I very much enjoyed the conversation. He was truly knowledgable of the area and great dining. Another instance of great service was on my last night I lost my valet ticket and called the front desk for assistance as I had to leave early in the morning. It was about 2:00 am on a sat night. The hotel actually didn't have a charge for valet for me so the front desk called valet and they were able to quickly find my car and ticket number. They also arranged to have a bellman at my room to help me with my luggage in the AM. King showed up the next morning with the luggage cart. Valet had my car in minutes. The rest of the good... good sized rooms great location maid service was good/daily and didn't bother me early in the morning to clean room. free breakfest for being a hilton diamond member Some of the bad. My AC made a repetitive clicking sound, I didn't call about it however.

So I wasn't looking forward to spending $300+ a night, but honestly, it was well worth it. The hotel is on Gravier, about two blocks west of Canal. Wasn't that hard to find, especially being familiar with the area. The valet service was extremely helpful with everything. You unload and then go up to the 11th floor to check in. The hotel rooms are 11-18. We stayed on the 15th after being moved. We requested two beds but initially only got one. The change was easy to make since we left our bags and went to jazz fest anyway. When we came back, our room was ready and they brought our bags up for us. The pool up on the roof looked nice, didn't try it though. Also a fitness room and a balcony to look out over the city. Great views of the quarter and superdome. Can't see the river, too far away. It was easy to get a taxi there. The French Quarter was about 3 blocks away, Bourbon Street also. Easy to get to and felt safe the entire time. Would recommend it to anybody, but of course there were enough people rambling around as well being a popular weekend. Breakfast at the Streetcar Cafe on Carondelet is a must. Great food and southern service. For dinner, we ate in the quarter, Oceana Grill and the 424 Pier Restaurant. Both wonderfully good seafood places with Oceana being slightly more expensive. Expect closer to $80 for 2 people with drinks. But the hotel, I can't really say enough good about it. From top to bottom, start to finish, the experience was great. Clean rooms. My worst thing I could say, in the bathroom the toilet paper rolls are under the sink and a long stretch away from the toilet itself. Not a great design, but like I said, gotta be the worst thing I can even think of. Well, the room view also. We had no view from the room itself (just an outdoor atrium to another building). But the view from the roof was fantastic, so not a huge deal. I'd be tempted to book here again for next Jazz Fest if I don't book sooner and maybe something cheaper, but the beds were very comfy so who knows. Like I said, well worth it just for a two day weekend and convenience.

My first room was on the 14th floor. The good: The room was surprisingly spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the staff was friendly. The shower was hot and water pressure was plentiful. Checkin was easy and wireless was free and worked well. The location is okay - a 5 minute walk to catch the St. Charles street car. Or a 5 minute walk to Canal Street (cross it and you're in the quarter). These are the most critical things about the hotel, so my non-recommendation is based on what's below. Now for the less important, but the bad: breakfast isn't worth the relatively low cost. Seriously, much of it was not even edible. Sausages were burned. Eggs were swimming in what had to be a cup of salsa. Grits had lumps the size of ping-pong balls. Pre-fixed hot items must be served to you. This means waiting in line behind those asking for custom orders to get something you could easily grab yourself. Took 15-20 minutes to get the food that was mostly bad. My wake-up call came two hours early. Not the end of the world, but I couldn't get back to sleep and was tired all day as I'd been up at the crack of dawn for my inbound flight that morning. The elevators had trouble reading the key cards. We were warned that this was an issue with one elevator at checkin - but the problem was with all elevators. Finally, I booked two non-smoking rooms and was given one non-smoking room, and smoking room, which was disgusting. Changing rooms the first night was impossible as the hotel was full. My colleague ended up in the smoking room, which I didn't find out was smoking until the next day. I would have switched hotels before allowing her to stay in a room that was like sleeping in a bar. The second night the smoking room was switched out for a non-smoking room. That room was fresh and nice, but very hot - the thermostat didn't work to cool down the room. My room was also hot, but I was able to adjust the temp to cool it off just fine. This really an average to nice HGI where a few details were allowed to bloom and overshadow otherwise fine rooms.

We had booked the Southern Summer Rate. A rate that included valet parking, a movie, popcorn and 2 sodas. We arrived Friday evening around 7:30pm. The valet parking was easy enough, check-in is on the 14th floor. Got there, waited a few minutes to be called on by a pleasant receptionist. So far so good... unfortunately things went downhill from that point forward. I asked about any available upgrades as a Hhonors Diamond member. Was told nothing was available. Kinda a disappointing start, but whatever, unfortunately it was the start of a downward trend. We were offered breakfast coupons we didn't use, and a couple bottles of water. Felt just like a HI minus the nice welcome letters from the GM's with chocolate bars in the room. We were then sent to the pantry to pick out some popcorn and sodas that were included with our rate, only they had no popcorn left (not a big deal), and no diet sodas (ok, so we go with water, again, no biggie), the downward trend continued. We got to our room on the 17th floor (1712), and it was... well, disappointing. The room had a very ordinary, OLD 25\"TV with poor reception (I try to avoid hotels that don't have flat panels at a minimum... whoops). The room was worn and dated. Definitely in need of upgrades. The bathroom was flat out terrible. Amongst the worse we've experienced (only beat out by a terrible worn bathroom at the ES Phoenix). The tub had significant scratches that flat out looked grungy, and a large indentation (dent, warp, something weird) in the middle of the tub (not near the drain) that forced you to be careful where you stepped while showering or risk slipping and getting hurt. As for the beds, wow, they were uncomfortable, and my neck still is hurting from the pillows. The first night we couldn't tune in the menu button on the relic of a TV, so we could get a list of available movies to see what the kids could watch with the free movie included in our rate, so set that aside for the next day. I tried using the WIFI to finalize our plans for Saturday, but the connection was terribly slow WIFI. I switched to a corded connection and couldn't get any internet. So settled on the very spotty, slow WIFI. Ultimately giving up entirely for the evening. Saturday I took the family all around New Orleans, and we had a great day riding Segways, walking the Garden District, and enjoying some great meals. Got back to our room around 8 or so with plans to let the kids watch their free movie. The menu system was finally working, so they selected and watched Clash of the Titans. Meanwhile mom and dad crashed early since we had to get up at an ungodly 3:30am to catch an early 6:30am flight out of MSY. We got up the next morning, and were ready to go by about 4am... apparently we were too early to get the checkout bill delivered to the room, so I sent the wife and kids down to get the car from the valet and got off at the 14th floor to check-out at reception. Unfortunately, NOBODY was there. I tried saying HELLO, knocked on the counter, no response. The office door was open behind the counter but there was no sign of life in there, though I couldn't see in too far. I suspect the desk agent was catching a catnap. After 15-20 minutes of making noise and trying to get someones attention, a receptionist finally strolled out of the office. I asked for a copy of my bill to checkout, and the woman tried to charge me for a number of items from the pantry that were sitting on the counter but not mine. Innocent enough mistake I guess (though it tells you that someone got tired of waiting and left). Anyhow, I politely inform her that I just want my receipt, those aren't my items. She printed it up, handed it to me, and to no surprise, it was wrong. I was charged for the movie that was to be included in my rate. I politely advised her that the Southern Summer special rate included valet parking and a movie, and she immediately got defensive and said not that movie. Only movie's $12.99 or less. Huh? Nowhere on the rate did it stipulate a maximum allowed rate. Nor was I advised of that at check-in. So I challenged the validity of that and the receptionist eventually took the illicit charge off my bill. All this time, my wife is texting and calling asking where the heck I am... it was over 30 minutes before I finally got downstairs to meet back up with them. Overall, we enjoyed New Orleans, but didn't enjoy the HGI FQ. The location is decent, but the service is inconsistent, the rooms are dated, and the staff is a mixed back.

I asked the desk clerk when it might become available, and she said that she had to check with housekeeping (okay, understandable). She radioed and radioed, with no response. Finally, she dialed an extension, and the person on the other end of the line evidently told her to radio - which produced the same result. Frustrated, I just stood at the counter until she got it resolved. We got into our room at about 2:30. Meanwhile, I had asked that a manager call me - because there was none on site (WHAT??!! - NO MANAGER at the hotel???). A manager did call, and she was contrite, and understood the frustration - and explained that the radios don't work all that well in an old building (solution: don't use them, use cell phones instead; I had 4 bars). They comped a movie and snacks for my son - I appreciated that effort.

The hotel is kind of secluded, so be careful or you will pass right by it on the narrow one way street it is located on. Valet parking only is kind of expensive, although not as much as the Doubletree just a couple of blocks down. Lobby is on the 11th floor, and the rooms are from 12 on up. It strikes me odd that you can do a daily park there as a tourist for 6 to 10 dollars a day, but as a guest it was 28.00, plus tax. But with the low rate I didnt see a reason to complain. Hotel check in was fast and friendly. Room was clean, nice, and quiet with a slight view of the water. Breakfast was good, and as a diamond member it was complimentary. I don't know if I would have paid 10.00 for it. Valet was quick to bring the car down and assisted with luggage. Harrahs Casino is only about a 4 block walk and Canal Street if only about 2 blocks away.

Both wired and wireless connectivity was available, and both were slow. Moreover, the wireless signal was very weak in most of the room.

Hotel was clean and easy to find and I would stay there again, price was reasonable at $159 a night however there were a few niggles. Firstly, there is a compulsory $2.50 charge per day for having a safe in your room. C'mon people, be honest - just add it to the total room charge upfront. This is just cheeky. Also, we had problem with never getting shampoo as the cleaning staff couldn't read the labels in English and got the mouthwash confused with shampoo. I know this because we asked them! Finally, whatever you do, do not eat at the 'Great American Grill' their in house restaurant. The food is very very poor, overpriced and the service dreadful. The waiter and waitress had to call over the manager to open our wine because they had never used a corkscrew before!!!! The steak was so over cooked I felt like re-soleing my shoe.

The size of our standard king room was exceptionally large by New Orleans standards and comparable to what you find in new construction HGI's around the country. The hotel is a conversion and not very welcoming from the street level entrance which is a parking garage. However, once you reach the lobby via the elevator to the 9th floor, you know you are in an HGI with the exception of a much larger common area than most. I can attest to the earlier reviews that the location is both quiet and convenient. In fact, Harrahs is only four blocks and the French Quarter maybe three. The pool area on the roof provides a nice view of the city and the smallesh fitness center overlooking the terrace is a nice touch. There is very litte wear on this hotel at least on the surface. What a deal for $84 and in New Orleans during peak nights a deal for at least twice that. Oh, did I mention they threw in free breakfast for my wife and I given my Gold Hilton HHonors status?
