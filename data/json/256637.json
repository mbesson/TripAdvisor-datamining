The hotel's proximity to shopping, Surry Hills restaurants and the Art Gallery and gardens make it ideal - the only issue is the rooms are very dark during the day and could use a soft refurbishment.

The hotel is located overlooking the park (hence the name) and is walking distance to transportation, sightseeing, and business. The room size is average, but the bathroom was re-done and very nice. Biggest tip from this stay- the Club Lounge at this location is worth the upgrade. As we learned, going out to meals and drinks in Sydney can be expensive! The club breakfast, free drinks, evening snacks, etc, easily make up for the upgrade price (ours was $50.00 at checkin). Plus, the free internet and views don't hurt either! The pool is small, but located on the top floor with a fun view, and the fitness center is more than adequate for a hotel this size. I've stayed at many Sheratons, and this one was easily my favorite so far. One other tip- a cab from the airport can be expensive ($50-$60aus), but there is a train station directly across from the hotel which costs closer to $15 for a one-way ticket to the airport.

I have stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks and have been upgraded to an Executive Suite on each occasion so my experience recently has been first class.

Reservation - we emailed the hotel regarding our stay and were assured of an upgrade to a suite on a arrival being Platinum guests. When we arrived we were assigned a small room facing a brick wall. Complete shock! After a long talk to the club reception they told us that our suite will be ready at 8pm and we can't check in until than. I've never heard anything like that before. They refused to give us any other room to stay in (I had 2 small children with me) until 8pm check in. That was at 3pm. They suggested I take my children for a walk for 5 hours!!!! In the end they found us park facing standard room (after 45 min of heated discussion). 2. Rooms - be careful most rooms are facing the back. Only park front rooms face the park. So if the view is important to you double check your reservation. Rooms are comfortable but could do with a bit of updating. Bathrooms are quite old. Park facing rooms are quite spacious. 3. Service - awful! A lot of times at the hotel we felt that we were in 3 star hotel at best. No complimentary water in the room, no slippers, no dental kits. have to ask for everything and they get things wrong. When we asked for water we were told that on that level they don't offer water! I had to call the manager to complain again. 4. General - bathrobes in the room were all ripped, very old. Same with the towels. Toiletries are the cheapest around. 5. Pool - nice little pool on top floor. Also has steam rooms / sauna in the change rooms (separate for men / women). 6. Club lounge - quite pleasant but food is very ordinary. We didn't find anything to nibble on. 7. Location - Excellent, right in the middle of the city, close to nice shops & restaurants. All in All - we would never stay here again.

At Sheraton on the Park you are on the doorstep to iconic retail stores like David Jones, and Centrepoint with all the leading luxury stores. And across the road from the Sheraton is the beautiful Hyde Park in the heart of the city. You are struck with large scale elegance with the majestic staircase in the Foyer of the hotel, and the standard of service matches the elegant surroundings with efficient, smart and helpful porters and reception staff. I was impressed by the service immediately when I checked in, as the clerk responded to my questions with lots of information about the Hotel. He described in detail The Executive Club, and the Starwood Preferred Guest program, SPG, and he even showed me on his own mobile phone, that you can download an SPG application, which should make future bookings easy. My room was upgraded from city side to Hyde Park view room, which was warm and inviting, with a selection of interesting artwork adorning the walls, and elegant round mirror above the bed. The marble bathroom was a good size with large bath and separate shower, which had amazingly good water pressure; I wish I could have it as good as that at home. There was a large plasma Tele, L shape lounge and large desk with an executive style chair. The cleaners should be highly commended as all the shiny appliances and tap wear literally sparkled. From the 10th floor you look out to the bank of trees in the park across the road, and you can see the gothic roof top of St Marys Cathedral, but from that level you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see into the park. Most importantly I slept very soundly, as the bedding is very comfortable, so much so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to buy their linen, quilt and pillows from their Sheraton at home range. The pool is arguably one of the best Hotel pools in Sydney, located on the top floor of the hotel with a glass ceiling. Remember to take your camera to the pool to capture the amazing vista from the azure blue pool, across Hyde Park to St Marys Cathedral and out to the Sydney Harbour. The pool and spa were both heated to perfect temperatures, and the overall impression of the area is relaxing and luxurious. The change rooms are fitted out with lockers, and there are spare bathroom products to use in the showers. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to try the steam and sauna rooms, or the Spa treatments but will try them next time. However I did meet the Spa staff at the Spa reception and they were very helpful supplying towels, a robe and locker key. . The 21st floor Executive club is another place to take your camera, as you can step out to a couple of small Juliet type terraces and enjoy the stunning view. There are lots of comfy booths and arm chairs, soft mood lighting, complimentary drinks and snacks, a relaxing place to escape the bustle of the city. I bumped into a business man, who said he travels 200 days a year, and that Sheraton in the Park is his favourite hotel worldwide, and I can understand why. Get to the Exec club early if you get a window seat to capture the full view. If you have a sweet tooth then look forward to sampling the gorgeous little desserts. Chrissy the Club manager is delightful and her team are quite attentive without being intrusive. I enjoyed breakfast the 1st day in the Exec Club, nice to have breaky with a view, and the staff are cheerful, quick to deliver tea/ coffee, and selection of eggs, bacon, baked beans, fruit, yogurts, cheese and bread. The 2nd day I had the buffet breakfast in the downstairs Restaurant. Eggs & omelettes are cooked on the spot by the chef to your personal preference, which I've experienced more predominantly in Asian Hotels but not so much in Australian hotels, so I was pleasantly surprised to get my tailored made omelette, and yes it was fabulous. Huge buffet selection in modern and sleek surroundings with outlook to the park through the large glass windows. My trip was for business, so I found the location very convenient. When I needed a taxi in the morning there were a couple of taxis waiting at the entrance. but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also bus and train stations just across the road. I was grateful that Katrina from guest services arranged to have my luggage collected from the room promptly while I was having breakfast, and it was there waiting for me as I grabbed a cab. The location is in walking distance to the other major streets in the CBD. Also just a quick stroll across the park, and past the beautiful large fountain, is St Marys Cathedral, one of Sydney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most treasured buildings. So many reasons to recommend this beautiful Hotel, its definitely a favourite Sydney hotel and I hope to go back again soon.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorld class hotel in a world class position\u201d", "Author": "Jackoaa", "ReviewID": "UR126219034", "Content": "An elegant hotel with discreet but friendly staff.

On a less positive note, although the Sheraton offers free wifi in its foyer, Wifi in the room costs AU$20 a day, which seems excessive given the growing number of hotels that offer this for free.

This deal included the perks of Executive Club membership \u00e2\u20ac\u201c canap\u00c3\u00a9s and drinks 5-7:30pm and breakfast 7-10am.

Kind of funny, really, and although I could\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve done with a little more sleep, it enabled us to leisurely shower and get ready and indulge in the breakfast provided in the Club Lounge before check out at 11am. Each staff member we encountered, from the valet parking attendant to the shoe shine man to the helpful woman on the reception desk who snipped a loose thread on my dress, were friendly, approachable and good at their job.

We stayed at this hotel for an 8 day period over Xmas for what was overall a reasonably enjoyable experience, i will get to the review of the property later but first..... On the day of check out after signing the final account and paying by credit card we discovered that the hotel had charged us for an in-room move that we had never purchased. We returned to the club floor and explained this to the staff who quickly removed the movie and canceled the first charges on our card or so we thought(just a quick note this hotel seems to enjoy charging guests for things they did not use as we were also charged for 1 night of Valet parking funny when we arrived in a Taxi) Our trouble began the day after we checked out when we arrived in our next destination Hong Kong. After checking into our hotel in HK we checked our credit card online to find that our limit had been reached and exceeded by charges from the hotel,with a very expensive phone call back to New Zealand we where informed that the hotel had attempted to charge our Card Three times for the stay as well as placing holding amounts on the card that exceeded the total amount of our stay by a considerable amount. So overall they had Clogged our Credit Card with an amount that was 4 Times what our total bill was. as you can imagine this can be problematic when traveling and is incredibly inconveniencing requiring days of emails and international phone calls to rectify. Prior to all this and while in the process of booking the hotel we also found a complete lack of service over the phone with reservation and front desk staff and management. It took three attempts to get a correct booking confirmation sent to us and at least 12-13 attempts to get a quote on a Hotel car to pick us up from the airport. Management made excuses for both errors and made a offer to send a European car to pick us up from the airport instead of the standard car when paying what i think was about $ 120 Aud for a car i would expect that it was European to start with not a glorified Holden Taxi. We politely declined the offer and payed for a Real Taxi which cost just $40 and came equipped with lovely driver. Now to the actual stay. We had booked an executive suite with club privileges. We found check in incredibly quick if not extremely welcoming. The room was large for an executive suite in a city hotel and had nice decor in the living and bedrooms with the bathroom aging but gracefully so. The room also boasted a great open view over Hyde park and Sydney harbor. The amenities on offer in the room where reasonably standard with two LCD tv's with all expected channels, well stocked mini bar ect ect..... The breakfast in the club lounge while decent could have done with a little variation after 8 days it got extremely repetitive. The lounge it self was average and the service incredibly hit and miss for example some mornings and evenings you would be asked for your drink order while others you would have to chase the staff hard to get a coffee or cocktail. The other bugbear was the supposedly free WI-Fi in the club lounge, on our first 2-3 days this WI-Fi was easy to use and access as expected with a password provided by the staff But apparently some bright spark thought this was costing the Hotel too much and to discourage the guests form using it they would make them connect to a much slower network with a password provided by the hour so guests would have to chase the elusive staff in the lounge for a password then while in the middle of something would have there internet cut off with no warning. Come on Guys I have stayed in guest houses in Cambodia with Free Unlimited internet its not too much to ask. The Food a beverage at the hotel we found to be Top notch both through room service and the restaurant and clearly the F&B manger has it ticking over nicely unlike other areas of the hotel. All in all if you want to be Ripped off not Replied to and Ignored the Sheraton On The Park Sydney is a great option. If not stay at the Westin or the Intercontinental we have and will again.

Overall, I'm very happy with my choice of hotel and would stay there again any time. Only downside was that I requested a shuttle to the airport which the hotel arranged correctly, but the concierge informed me that I could pay the driver with credit card. However, once I sat in the shuttle he only accepted cash.

Whether you are regularly travelling on business or coming to Sydney for the first time I can highly recommend this hotel. There are lots of hotels in Sydney, and many of these are closer to the quay or harbour. I would still recommend the Sheraton. It is right next to the main shopping areas, it is a 15 minute stroll to pretty much anything you might want to do and, if you need to, cross the road and catch the train from St James. Why do I recommend it? There are a range of positives: * Quiet rooms (mostly). If you have a high floor, no problems regardless of where you stay. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms are noisier if low down \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153park side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms mostly are quiet and have good views. * Sizeable rooms and bathrooms with all the things you need. I like the corner rooms for their size and space, but the bathrooms in all rooms are the sort of size all hotels should aspire to. Nothing tiny here. * Views. If you look onto the park, this is really good. Note that park-side rooms do not all look directly onto the park. * Great access to areas for a stroll or run. Head down to Mrs Macquarie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s chair from Hyde Park, and then around the Botanic Gardens to the Opera House. A nice touch is that in the morning there is bottled water and towels available on your return \u00e2\u20ac\u201c classy. * Breakfast where simple things are done right. There is a selection of four newspapers, the buffet really is one of the best I have experienced, and if you ask for tea or a particular coffee, it comes. The room also looks out onto the park \u00e2\u20ac\u201c nice. * Really friendly staff and a great concierge.

I booked a hotel car to take my bridesmaids and me to the wedding because I thought it was the least risky option (eg, we were staying there so the car is in the same place). \u00c2\u00a0 When we were ready to go, I asked my brother to go over and tell them we were ready. He did. And came back to report there was no car booked. Now, although the hotel has never actually explained what happened, I have the emails I sent asking for it and when the woman at the front desk checked the book the next day she said it was cancelled. Somewhere along the line there was a misunderstanding. But what I am most frustrated by is that nobody actually apologized to me when it happened. In fact, nobody from the hotel even spoke to me about it. Nor did anybody actually try to fix this problem. I had to walk out to the front of the hotel in my wedding gown and hail a taxi.\u00c2\u00a0 Ideally, when it happened, I think they should have escalated the problem, sent a manager to talk to me who should have said \"what can we do now?\" and I would have said \"just get a taxi\". If that had happened I probably wouldn't be writing this now. We did express our concerns in a letter to the manager of the hotel and he has apologized and offered us a free upgrade next time we stay. Thanks but we really don't plan to ever stay here again. Was everything else perfect? Not really. The ceiling was leaking in our suite-there was quite a bit of rain water coming in; I don't think it just suddenly happened that day. We were given towels to clean it up. We did have an issue with an item on our bill but that was resolved when we questioned it.

The bathrooms are luxurious with stunning black marble tile surrounds and flooring; the puffy white towels and bathrobes are always welcome after a day out walking in town too, and the large bathtub with separate shower is another touch that is not always seen in city hotels. The front desk staff have always been very professional to us over a long period of time, indicating that they are very well trained for their duties in a 5 star Hotel environment. Recently we tried the Executive Club option, which had an additional cost, however it was certainly very well worth that extra cost, and we fully intend to take that option the next time that we book. The American staff member in the Exec Lounge was impressively attentive, and made us feel very much at home. The package includes canapes and drinks as well as breakfast, in a private situation with lovely water views- thoroughly recommended. We really love the atmosphere at the Sheraton on the Park and thoroughly recommend this Hotel. Have stayed in just about every type of room over the years, however whilst most folk will recommend the Hyde Park rooms, we like the Corner City View rooms better- just a matter of taste. Breakfast here is always top class. The only Hotel on par that we have found is Sheraton in Port Douglas. A tip though if you go for a Hyde Prk view room- We stayed on Floor 4 or 6 and the view looking into the trees instead of higher up, is very lovely.

We had an executive park view room. For hotels, the bathroom is the most important feature in my opinion. Let me tell you that the Sheraton had the BEST bathroom in all of Sydney. I did a lot of research on 5 star hotels and I am absolutely 100% glad that I booked with Sheraton. I would have regretted it if I stayed anywhere else. I'll explain why in more detail: The bathroom was sensational and luxurious, I loved the marble! The beds were comfortable and the room was pretty spacious. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor of the room and the lobby was perfect for a 5 star hotel! You really felt special here. I did expect a better view from the room though. I guess the photos on the Sheraton website aren't an accurate representation of the view for ALL rooms in the hotel....but I did expect to see much more of the park from my room and less of the hotel walls. This is why I can't give a 5 point rating to \"value\" or \"rooms\" on Trip Advisor because I did choose to pay more for a room with a view; and expected a really beautiful view..but it just wasn't beautiful at all! The breakfast (which was included in the price of our room) was wonderful. Lots of choices and really delicious. The server was so kind to me because I have a lot of food interolances (gluten free, dairy free etc) and she went back and forth to the chef (on her on accord, I didn't even ask her too) to see if they had other gluten free cereals for me. They already had gluten free bread and soy milk which was great! It really relieved a lot of stress for me and she was so kind to help me out and comforting too. The only thing I was disappointed about was the reception. I felt like they weren't as polite/accommodating as they could have been..maybe because we are young guests (I am 18 my sister is 21) but at the end of the day, we are still paying guests and should be treated the same. I was asked 3 times by security if I was really a guest in the hotel and he seemed dubious when I said I was. I think that happened because I believe there were celebrities (or a really special guest) staying at the hotel at the time, so I do understand if they were just being wary of fans loitering in the lobby. However, if there weren't celebrities there, they really shouldn't have inquired whether we were guests or not. Do they think young people loiter in hotel lobbies for fun? No, I've got better things to do in my time, thank you! As for the location of this hotel, it is FABULOUS. You could not ask for better. We were walking distance from a beautiful park (perfect for touristy photos), and SO close to the CBD mall and other specialty shops (ie. David Jones, an alteration's place, JBHIFI, lots of restaurants etc etc). Plus, the sydney opera house was only 6 minutes away in a taxi. Overall, it was a wonderful choice to stay in the Sheraton. I am so glad, and TRULY cannot wait to my next stay there! I am going to recommend it my friends, and probably bring them along with me on my next stay! The only thing is I hope that they learn to treat younger guests the same because we are paying guests too and have the absolute right to be treated as such.

Wifi was pretty quick and I could sit there at my leisure and have some nibbles and go online. Breakfast was free every morning & you also get free wine at happy hour so it was very good. Staff again are very attentive. Not everyone gets access to this area you need to be a preferred cardholder or pay for it. - Service - when I checked in my room wasnt ready. I was in the business centre when my room became available. They dropped up the room key to me and then left my bag in my room for me - it's the little things like this that make you feel special. - Mini-bar was well serviced. - Room & bed were comfortable.

Towels are provided and the place is very clean 6- The room was spacious and had a lovely bathtub and shower to relax in after a day of sight seeing 7- the location is fantastic. Close to everything. Cons: 1- the first room we checked into was not a \"park view\" like expected, you had to turn your head around form a side window to see the park. It has to do with the angle the building is at. So if it really matters to you , double check before you book the room 2- The plumbing in the first room was a bit off, so when the bath tub was emptying out the water, the rest of the bathroom flooded! 3- The first room was also right next to the service room, so there was a lot of door noise through out the day and night. All of the cons were dealt with by the staff immediately and we moved to a proper \"park view\" room that was very spacious and nice.

We have been many times and usually stay at the Sheraton. Shopped around on the web as prices were quite high as Sydney is full this weekend. Was going to try the Westin and had booked but then noticed three days out that SPG website price went down to $290 for twin room incl breakfast and late checkout. So we ended up at Sheraton. On checkin tried asking for Park upgrade, ended up costing us $40 per night but it is well worth it. The view of the park from 16th floor is glorious with the church there, also the room has a balcony for that extra bit of luxe. Anyway so glad we stayed here it is superb, luxurious rooms and fabulous buffet breakfast that usually costs $42pp. Other 5 star hotels are slightly off centre from the shopping even the Westin. I went to have a look and to be honest the Westin seemed huge to me. I like the more intimate feel of the Sheraton, even though the Sheraton has 500 rooms against Westin 400. My tips for the Sheraton are: Join SPG and check rates, they are moving all the time, SPG floors are very well kept. Join up if you need to. Use back entrance at Lobby area and go to Elizabeth St entrance of David Jones, the lower ground floor is the most wonderful food court. You can eat there as well or get gourmet takeout. Over at the Piccadilly Centre (same exit as above) across the road there is a Vodafone booth. I just got a 5gb prepaid sim card for my Ipad for $29, usuable for a month, as I find the $24 per day internet room charge here a bit high. BTW that might be a limited offer as it is usually only 2gb for $29. If you want to get a lot done in a short amount of time, the Sheraton is the centre of the universe for shopping Sydney. You will spend more time at other hotels getting to your location. Either that or the room won't be as big as what you get at the Sheraton.

We booked their \"stay, park and play\" package at 259AUD per night. This included breakfast (which normally costs 42AUD per person). The breakfast is great and there is extensive choice, including full English, continental, Thai, even a dedicated omelette chef. We booked a city side room (of course the views are not going to be as nice as park side). The rooms are spacious and have lovely plantation style shutters which can be angled up as you wish, there are also black out blinds. Large luxurious marble bathrooms too. The beds are just so comfey. We arrived early in the morning after a 22 hour flight from Heathrow. We were greeted by a lovely receptionist (who was friendly and professional). She was also able to book us into a room straight away. We try and fit in a daily swim and jacuzzi (usually pretty empty...guess the business travellers don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have time to swim!).

If we had one gripe, we would say that the bar is soul less. However, if you turn right outside of the hotel and walk for 1 minute you will find the fabulous Bambini wine room. Sheraton on the Park gives you the best location from which to explore Sydney. For example, turn right out of the hotel (concierge will give exact directions) and a 20 min walk will find you in Surry Hills (food lovers paradise\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.Billy Kwong, Assiette, Spice I am, Red Lantern to name a few places tried this time and loved) .

Overall, I was very pleased by the accommodations, facilities & presentation of the hotel and its staff. As a Starwood Preferred Member, I usually find that I am able to check-in once I arrive. I usually fly about 24 hours before I arrive in Sydney at 6:30AM & it's REALLY NICE to have a room to check into immediately. The 1 and only, slightly negative comparison I can make to another Starwood hotel, the Westin on Martin Place where I am always checked-in upon arrival, is that I had to wait a couple of hours before I was checked-in. Not the end of the world & got to check-in early anyway . From the start, I was impressed when handed my room key card, as I had asked for my luggage to be brought up. Apparently, it had already been placed in the closet for me. The rooms are a generous size with a very smart, practical layout. The placement of the bed, the work desk and small shaped seating area & table fit perfectly. Nothing was cramped. The walk-in closet provided more than ample space to hang clothing, position luggage and close doors. Directly across nicely-sized bathroom with separate shower and tub. The sink had ample space to place all I needed to and still manage to have a lot of space. The bathroom had black and white marble, which I dislike in general, but was extremely happy with the accommodations as they were. There were a number of windows all around my room. Even better, and a feature most hotels do not use, I had a nifty switch next to the bed which controlled motorized blackout shades and another switch for room lighting. Every member of the hotel staff was extremely professional and polite. Although there is an in-room fee for internet, you may use the internet for free on your own device in the lobby.

The work desk and chair is comfortable enough for a full day of work. The fitness centre, pool, spa, sauna, and day spa are all exceptional - including a balcony and floor-to-ceiling windows surrounding the pool, overlooking Hyde Park - it's a great inclusion. The room service menu has a good range, although expect to pay a premium. The mini bar can be paid for using Starwood Preferred Guest StarPoints, which is great for business travellers who are members. The option of using \"Link @ Sheraton\" in the foyer gives free computer/Internet access - although access in room is paid. I love the packages that the hotel often offers through its website, including one that often includes self-parking and buffet breakfast for around $50/night more than the cheapest room rate. This is excellent value, especially as the self-parking includes unlimited entry/exit over a 24 hour period. Great when you want to use the hotel as a base, but travel to and from several meetings. The hotel is also exceptionally consistent - I have stayed at least 10 times this year, and every stay has offered me exactly what I expected, or better - down to the room type, included amenities, and rate inclusions.

The quantity of water that the shower produced can only be described as a deluge, almost enough to knock you off your feet and wash you down the plug hole. Great for those like me who tend to use the shower as a marker in the assessment of the hotel experience but bad news for the environment, if there is an environmental issue.

There was tea and coffee of every persuasion and the service was impeccable. We found a defective kettle in the room, rang customer service and it was replaced within five minutes. We were given access to the Executive Club and the health club. Up on the 22nd floor is a sparkling professional-sized gym with spa and sauna and a heated swimming pool plenty big enough for doing a few laps. It was very impressive. There was something exotic about a swimming pool at the top of the building. And the Executive Club on the 21st floor is one of the most comfortable and cosy rooms I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve experienced anywhere in the world. There are armchairs, alcoves and in the centre a glass case containing flames, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t hot, but added a wonderful ambience to the room. Hot snacks were there aplenty as the wine was top drawer. Pre dinner drinks went from 5-7.30 pm, which was perhaps a good job because it would be so easy to settle in for the night. In the Botanica Brasserie the breakfast buffet is all you can ask for \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it served the best croissants I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever eaten in any hotel!

The location of this hotel is hard to beat, affording easy access to the Eastern Suburbs and all that the Sydney CBD has to offer. We booked the 'Stay, park and play' package, which included a city side room, breakfast and self parking, which was pretty good value at $269 p/n Our room was quite good in general although there is clearly an issue with the air conditioners ability to adequately cool the room. If you like your bedroom cool when you sleep, it's likely you will be disappointed. The hotel sent an engineer to check the air con. There was a note in the room when we returned from our days outing saying that the fault was located and had been resolved but in reality, we found there was little to no difference after the air con was serviced by maintenance personnel which leads me to surmise that the air con cooling function is simply inadequate. We could also hear the guests in the next room each time they used their bathroom to shower or use the toilet, not to mention hearing just about every door on the 18th floor close or slam. Noise issues are not something I expect from a 5 star hotel. The breakfast at Botanica was quite good but would have been close to great if the staff were a) more welcoming, and b) willing to make eye contact so you don't have to do somersaults in order get there attention and then once you do, you feel like they are doing you a favour. IMO, breakfast sets the tone for the rest of the day and with the exception of one or two individuals, the breakfast shift staff looked generally disinterested and we found some staff to be quite rude including but not limited too, talking in a different language. The food and beverage manager walked around with his arms folded and on Sunday morning, he looked as though he had just woken up. The breakfast staff looked as though they would rather be elsewhere (with the exception of Linda who could always be seen with a smile). I would also like to know why 4 or 5 staff were continually congregating around the entrance to the breakfast area, while they should be looking to provide a better overall experience to guests that are seated? Basically the food was good but the service was very poor indeed. Overall the staff throughout the hotel were not overly personable or friendly but we were fortunate to have Vanessa check us in and check us out.

We received a reply from the Hotel Manager indicating to us how well the hotel had managed the situation and \" I believe we took every action to ensure the remainder of your stay was enjoyable for you both.\" Glad he thought so because we certainly didn't and we were the paying guests. We chose Sheraton on the Park to celebrate a special occasion and really were expecting a pleasant stay. However, we quickly realised this was not going to be as pleasant as we had hoped. We have stayed in plenty of 5 star accommodation throughout the world and have learnt that 5 star establishments also have rooms that are a 2 star standard and we asked at check-in on the standard of our room. We received the glib, all rooms at the Sheraton are very nice. All except the one we were allocated. It was in the bowels of the hotel and was so far from the elevator that you needed a map to find it. The outlook from the window was a claustrophobic wall of concrete which literally surrounded us. We knew that it was sunny outside but you couldn't tell from our window view. If you weren't depressed when you entered the room rest assured you would be by the time you left. An added insult was the adjoining room that had very noisy guests who kept us awake for most of the night. The next morning we requested a move and spoke with the front desk manager, who in the most dismissive tone and superior manner gave us a lecture, that was the room we had booked and were entitled to and not to book through the discount accommodation websites but to use their Starwood/ Sheraton sites. If you are going to be given inferior rooms as a consequence for booking on the discount sites, then this should be clearly indicated on the websites. This was early morning after breakfast and we were told that we would be moved later in the day even though we knew there were plenty of available rooms. So we came back later in the day to find that they had move us to a room directly behind the busy hotel 6 lifts. They must have had a great chuckle at our expense. Again down to request a change of room and finally we moved to a front facing room. The attitude was that we should feel grateful that they had moved us to a superior room, not that they were remorseful that we had wasted so much of our valuable holiday time on something that could have been fixed in a matter of seconds if they had genuinely given a hoot about their guests' concerns. Hint; If you don't enjoy your stay at the Sheraton on the Park don't fill out the guest survey unless you give the feedback they want to hear.There are much better hotels in a better location at Circular Quay such as The Hotel intercontinental (great food at Etch which is unfortunately something that Sheraton on the Park has a lack of) , Quay Grand Suites, Marriott Sydney Harbour and Sir Stamford at Circular Quay.

We received an email straight away confirming our booking & also another email two days prior to the date to re-confirm our booking!! Wow this Hotel is on the ball!! We were not disappointed. Easy parking being guided by the Hotel Staff through the basement, then a quick lift to the Lobby/Reception. Check in was easy enough, and the lady that served us was very friendly even though she did have a very strong asian accent!! She asked were we here on hols or a special occassion and we told her about our Anniversary, so she handed us a written note from the Hotel to have a complimentary glass of wine each in the Conservatory Bar. - very nice touch!! When we opened the door to our room we were hit with a wonderful fresh citrus scent. Quite welcoming I think!! Our Room had a Park View from the small bay window. The other window was facing the Hotel, so I had to keep the curtains closed at all times, as I noticed that I could see clearly into the other rooms - and obviously they could do the same into our room!!! LOL.... The room itself was a little small I thought. Maybe because our bedroom at our home is twice the size, but I suppose its a little bigger than a standard main bedroom. I think the feeling of small was because it was quite congested. It had an L-shape couch, with an office table & large long buffet that had a small plasma & fridge attached. The furnishing was good quality, so it looked very beautiful. The bed was very confortable, and the pillows nice & luxurious. It would have been great if the tv was a little bigger, as we watched a midnight movie (and as ours at home is a 54\") and I felt I needed to sit close to capture the movie!! The bathroom is really really beautiful. Love the all black!! Its quite glamorous!!!! Just a pity it didn't have a tv by the bath....that would have topped it off!!!!! I used the shampoo & conditioner - and they were quite good products. The shower was large & so too was the bath. The tea/coffee facility was fantastic. The variety of teas available was heaven!! I love my tea, and I love all types too - they had green tea, earl grey & english breakfast. Also there was decaf coffee - which my hubbie loves. There was even two Jarrah Choc sachets, consumed by us during our midnight movie!! Breakfast buffet was to die for!!!! I was in heaven!!!! The variety was endless!! From cereals, variety of yogurts, fresh cut fruit & fresh juices. Hot food included fried eggs, Eggs Benedict, sausages, hash browns, baked beans, baked tomatoes, sauteed mushrooms & lots lots lots more. It has an Omelette station - the chef makes your own to your taste!! The pastries were delicious, around 8 different varieties!! Lots of different breads to toast & rolls too. There was a mini freezer with two gelato flavours - the vanilla pod gelato was delicious with a pastry!! I ate like a Queen!!! There was even a fresh brewed coffee pot on our table when we arrived - very nice touch!! Or if you preferred, any type of tea or coffee (latte's, caps, macchiatos etc) available upon request & included. Botanica Brasserie Seafood Buffet never came close to the variety available for breakfast. And I do have to say (sorry Sheraton) but I don't rate it at all. We were so disappointed!!

For the romantics only 4min walk to TIFFANY & CO!! 10min walk to THE ROCKS, 5-7min walk to OPERA HOUSE & CIRCULAR QUAY (where all the ferries are available). 1min walk to ST JAMES STATION. 15min walk to SYDNEY AQUARIUM & SYDNEY WILDLIFE PARK, & DARLING HAROUR!! Across from ST MARY'S CATHEDRAL, 15min walk to BOTANICAL GARDENS etc. Totally recommend this gorgeous hotel, quite charming & good value I say!!", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cConvenient good quality hotel\u201d", "Author": "blenheim72", "ReviewID": "UR110842892", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel for two nights with a breakfast and late check out package costing AUD$230 per night.

The location is great for both business and pleasure travel and the free CBD bus which stops more or less outside the hotel is a good way to get to Circular Quay and elsewhere. This is probably not a true five star hotel (no night turndowns etc) but is certainly a very good four and a half stars. Breakfast was excellent with an extensive buffet and a la carte items such as eggs benny and espresso coffees available in the price. However if you don't have breakfast included in your room rate, it costs AUD$42 per person. With the high Australian dollar that is about US$44 or close to 30 pounds.

Overall, very good stay. Some salient pros and cons below : Pros : 1. Excellent location. Hyde Park is just opposite. The bus stop and train station are just across the road. The free CBD 555 shuttle esp was extremely useful, only downside being that it stopped 3:30PM. 5-10 mins by bus to Circular Quay. Also very near (5 mins walk) to the nearest David Jones dept Store and the large Pitt Street Mall (Westfield, Myers etc). We found David Jones (between the Market Street and Elizabeth Street stores) to have the best range of all types of clothes and products. For most places (like Darling Harbour, Taronga Zoo, Manly etc) you just need to take the free shuttle to Circular Quay and catch the ferry from there. The Pitt Street mall has an excellent food court as well (the Thai place is open until 7 PM and has yummy food). There are a few good eateries within 10 mins walk from the hotel - MacDonalds, a Turkish kebab place etc. 2. Lovely breakfast buffet. This was at the Botanica Brasserie. The Club Lounge breakfast (which we experienced just the first day) was very limited and continental. At Botanica Brasserie, the spread was awesome. Special mention to the lady chef at the egg station. Mouth-watering omelettes and sunny-side-ups. Nice fruit and yoghurt varieties. Good sausages, bacon, hash browns etc too. And some noodles and stuff. Overall an awesome spread. We enjoyed breakfast every single morning, and it filled us up nicely for the day ahead. We had got a breakfast inclusive rate of about 250 AUD, direct at the hotel website so opted for that. Cons: 1. Everything costs extra. We had the most expensive in room water bottles, 500 ml for AUD 6.00 !! And there were more expensive options at AUD 9 per bottle !! Most international hotels provide at least 2 free bottles of water, here, nothing. In room dining again expensive. We opted for it just the first night. 2. Room was good, but could have been a little better. In room housekeeping were sometimes sloppy, not replacing toiletteries etc always. We were 3 of us, my husband and me, and my 4 year old. So they could have provided extra toiletteries and towels but they did not until we asked them to. 3. The entertainment selection available on the television was rather poor. No international channels like HBO, Start, AXN,etc. were available. You have to watch either the local Aussie cannel 7 or buy movies - which for us one day did not work.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than last time\u201d", "Author": "tula2006", "ReviewID": "UR109397891", "Content": "I stayed at the SOTP last November and wrote a review.

Our arrival was a little chaotic and it was difficult to work out what was going on, however to be fair to the hotel we discovered a few hours later that a teenpop celebrity was staying in the hotel and was in the course of leaving for his evening gig when we arrived which would explain why the bell staff were very flustered. We had booked a city view room and found we had a room with a very city view, into the next door offices however this was not a reason for us to ask for a change as we now read others have done, we had not booked the room for a view and were delighted that this position meant we were in a very quiet room on 11th floor. The room was very spacious, lovely bathroom and well appointed. Did like the availability of the plug adaptor in the drawer, a big help! Room servicing was spotty - our nightwear was dumped on the desk one day and left on the sofa on another day and bins were not emptied one day - not a big deal, just contributes to why we give this hotel 4 not 5 stars this trip Our rate included breakfast and we thought the buffet offered an excellent choice, although there were issues with its temperature - one day we spotted the hotplates had not been switched on, the staff sorted this and removed all the cold food, however we could not wait as we had an excursion to join so did not enjoy hot food that day. That experience did not put us off eating in the hotel and we were very glad we had the dinner buffet on our last night when our feet were too tired to venture out. At $60 a head that might seem expensive until you realise this is Sydney where all costs are high and the range on this buffet is exceptional - lobsters, crabs legs, several hot dishes a speciality station and a very great array of desserts. We were very impressed by the way the maitre d handled our question about food content, based on the fact my husband has a nut allergy - the head chef came out and personally walked him round and discussed the content of all the dishes with him. That was excellent service well done! It was also nice next morning that the same chef spotted my husband at breakfast and asked for feedback on our buffet experience and also checked was my husband ok re breaksfast choices (he always is as he is a melon then bacon and eggs man) Bar prices were a little steep and on the first night we went for a bar snack - it was a Friday evening and the place was very noisy and it was difficult to get service, though once we did eventually get a server she was attentive but the delay in getting the cheese platter was way too long and she had to chase it 3 times. We asked the concierge questions from time to time on our trip and all queries were answered promptly and with what we felt were good answers. We were particularly happy with the airport shuttle they organised for us on our departure at a cost of $14 each which was prompt and very efficient. The location of the hotel is excellent, well served by buses and it was a great tip from the concierge re the 555 free bus - saved us quite a bit!

From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby, it looked grand! I have stayed at several 5* hotels in Sydney and abroad and found the fittings and feel of this hotel outstanding! We were attending a play at Capitol Theater so we checked in around 11.00 am. We were told that our room was not ready but offered to hold on to our luggage. That was fine with us and we were expecting that. Cameron at the front desk was very nice and friendly and a pleasure to meet. On return, we got our keys and were told that our bags had been taken up which was a very nice touch! Again Steve, who I think may have been the manager on duty was very nice and a good first impression of the hotel. The room was simply sublime! The bathroom has to be the best bathroom I have ever seen in a standard room!! (we were on the 20th floor) The room was perfect! It was large and well fitted and was modern but still elegant and classy. At this point, there was nothing I could fault the hotel for, everything was to expectation. The only criticism would be assistance we received from the night customer service phone assistance (\"Unhelpful girl on the phone\"). Firstly her english was not the greatest, but that would be okay if she knew what she was talking about. Every question or request we had, she seemed to have to look it up in a manual or something, it was obvious that she had no idea off the top of her head. My two main complains were: At around 10.30 pm, I called to find out if music could be played in the bathrooms. We had noticed that there were speakers in the bathroom and a volume dial. When I called, she had no idea what I was talking about and you could clearly tell she was looking up some reference book (probably room features or something) and her final solution was that we turn up the sound on my iphone so we could hear the music in the bathroom. She completely ignored my inquiry as to what the volume nob was. I was not happy but couldn't be bothered to try and explain this to her. At around 11.30 pm, I realised that I had forgotten my contact lens solution and case to store my contacts overnight. I reluctantly called the assistance line again and was de-heartened when i got the unhelpful girl on the phone. I told her that I had not brought any contact solution with me and would need to store my lenses and asked whether the hotel had any. Again, she seemed to refer to some reference book and said that the hotel did not. That was it, no further prompts or ideas, just that the hotel didn't. While I think all hotels (at least the 5* ones) should have available contact lens solution as any wearer would know, if you don't have any, you can't store them, my annoyance isn't that the hotel didn't have any, but how unhelpful the girl was. I would have at least expected her to try and find out where I could get some, but she was totally unhelpful!!! I was very disappointed with her service and had I not brought my glasses with me , i would not have been able to drive home or function at all the next day as I had to throw out my contacts as I couldn't store them. But the reason I still highly recommend this hotel is that the all the other staff we dealt with were outstanding, They were all very friendly and helpful. My partner pointed out that she though every single female staff was very good looking as well!! (I thought it best not to comment to be on the safe side :P) Bottom line.... Very good hotel!!! I was looking at booking again for the 14th of May as I need to be in the city again but the price quoted is significantly higher then what I paid this time around. Unfortunately while I loved the hotel, the bad taste left in my mouth by the unhelpful girl on the phone will probably make me try another hotel, but I will wait to decide as I really did loved this hotel.

As this was not quite ready we had to wait for a while but a coffee in the Club Lounge soon passed the time and when we were shown to the room we were delighted. It was twin rather than a double but it was tasteflly furnished and the beds were very comfortable and we slept well both nights.

The first evening we went to the Club Lounge for drinks and the canap\u00c3\u00a9s were so extensive that we did not need an evening meal. It was very busy and there was a great atmosphere in the lounge. The next evening we decided to try the hotel restaurant (mistake!)

The breakfast is sufficient too \u00e2\u20ac\u201c definitely a notch above that of its rivals for its variety of offerings. As an SPG Plat I also take advantage of the lounge, which does get very crowded at times but is still a great place to hang out. The gym is very well appointed too. I cannot comment on the pool as I have never used it. In summary the hard product of the hotel is intact and is very good. You will likely have no complaints with regards to these. In terms of service, the hotel has gone cold and careless. This used to be a property where each and everyone that you encountered greeted you and were interested in whether your stay is going well. The doormen opened doors for you not because they were made to, but because they were genuinely interested in caring for my comfort (or at least that is what it felt like). I still remember the time when I could approach anyone in the staff to strike up a friendly chat. Now, everyone looks busier, even when they are not really \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbusy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. They are always doing \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsomething\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and no longer \u00e2\u20ac\u02dclook up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 at the guests. Just two examples: One would be the concierge. Good were the days when I could approach them and they would be more than happy to assist (i.e. go beyond expectations to help with directions etc). The last time I asked them to fetch my bags from the storage room (on my way to the airport), I was told to wait (he did not even look up at me) while he had to call someone. And so I waited, but as the wait continued for a minute or so, I gently told him that I had to get to the airport soon. To this he tersely put down the phone, swung into the storage room, showed up with my bag and swung it in front of me\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 before stomping back to his desk to continue making the call. I stood there feeling rather stupid for what felt like a whole minute before moving on out. This is perhaps the only time that I was not even asked the very standard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do you need a taxi to the airport?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd This is but one example of the concierge team going downhill. The team has certainly turned much colder. Another quick example is the phone operator. They now sound like robots and the worst part is that this is now the only hotel that I have ever visited where the operator (or whoever is on the phone) hangs up on you with an abrupt \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcThank you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 even before you are done talking. Where is the (again) very standard \u00e2\u20ac\u0153is there anything else I can help you with?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd before hanging up? It feels as if they want to minimize their level of interaction with the guests to the absolute minimum. Will I stay here again? No I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t because I do not want to pay 5 star hotel prices for a hotel that is a 4 star. The fifth star is for the service and this has gone missing in my last two stays. I might give it one last chance but it is already off my list as a favorite place to stay in Sydney. I cannot believe that I am saying this now but I really think that the SPS can learn a thing or two from the Hilton or Mr. Zumstein\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s team.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cFrom Chocolates to Boiled Lollies\u201d", "Author": "ctraveltheworld", "ReviewID": "UR98706881", "Content": "I have been a regular guest here for many years.

The spa is nice, but as we wanted to use the pool it was more like a children's playground than a place to swim and relax, with a lot of screaming and noisy kids all around, so we left again immediately.

The room was large enough and very well laid out with a separate walk-in closet/little room for our luggage. This was great because we could just put down our stuff and it didn't clutter up the main room. The bed was cozy and comfortable with nice clean linen. There was tea and coffee with a kettle in the room. The bathroom was also very generous in size with a separate large shower (with a proper shelf to hold your shampoo, soap, etc. something many hotels don't have) and bathtub. The hotel thought through the details and what travelers need for a comfortable stay. The service was attentive and efficient. If we needed something, it got brought up to our room right away. Our best surprise of the stay was the breakfast buffet. It was incredibly diverse in choice and everything was very fresh and tasty. I'm not much of the eggs and bacon type in the morning, but the sausages, eggs, and potato fritters here were the best ever! There were more fruits, cheeses, cakes, and other goodies than I could recount. It was a breakfast I would wish to have at every hotel. We could have stayed on through lunch! The only drawback of the hotel is the lack of light / view in some of the rooms. It was raining when we arrived and it felt quite gloomy inside.

The standard rooms are quite a large size (even by Sydney standards), with a huge walk in cupboard - perfect if you are travelling with a lot of luggage.

The hotel is located right on Hyde Park, but if you don't want to pay for the park view, the other rooms have a nice city aspect.

We booked a last minute stay, park and play package for $300 on a Friday night which included overnight accommodation in a city view room, buffet breakfast for 2 and self parking. Without hesitation I state this is the best value in Sydney and have already tried to book again for my husband's birthday in March but sadly that package is unavailable. The room (2111) was enormous - king bed (feather pillows), lounge (big enough to recline on and someone else to sit too), desk, walkin in robe and the largest marble bathroom I have ever encounted. Everything was spotless not a bit of dust anywhere - congratulations housekeeping. The bed was awesome and the feather pillows were excellent - all linen was immaculate. Fully stocked bar fridge and a big variety of tea, coffee, sugar etc and good quality stuff too not your usual hotel rubbish. Bathroom - where do you start - is it with the black marble, the timber, the polished fittings, the huge shower, the full bath, the plentiful plush fluffy towels or the toiletries and the fully functioning Vidal Sassoon hairdryer with attachments? Perhaps a walk in wardrobe tickles your fancy - it tickled mine with its fluffy bathrobes,huge room safe, iron and board and plenty of drawers and hanging space to store all your stuff AND your suitcases and then close the door on it. Wow!!! Breakfast was the best I have ever eaten at a hotel. Pricey at $42.00 per person usually but included in the room tariff. We were sat next to a window overlooking Hyde Park. Breakfast was all the usual stuff including an egg station cooking fresh eggs, actually everything was fresh and constantly refreshed - nothing was greasy and the fruit - to die for. My husband loved the pasties and I really appreciated the English Breakfast tea in a teapot that didn't leak!! Now how often do you find that? We also ordered room service - two perfectly prepared and steaming hot meals were delivered to our room and were delicious. Once again the presentation was A1 and included extras like a selection of bread rolls and butter/margarine and chilled water - which we idn't expect but really appreciated. My husband said the lamb shanks were the best he had eaten in a long time. I loved my chicken too. Staff right throughout the hotel from reception to floor staff to health club couldn't have been more helpful and were cheery and efficient. All were immaculately presented and attired and did the brand proud. Now the health club - indoor heated swimming pool and spa was incredible and the view over the harbour was so unexpected. What a wonderful place to hang out and take in the sunshine and fresh sea breezes - this we really appreciated during our stay as Sydney was experiencing one of the longest heat spells on record. And they provide the beach towels too have I mentioned that??!!! I didn't experience, this time, any spa treatments but the treatment rooms were very impressive. Now to give balance to this review (otherwise you might think that a staff employee was writing it) the self parking was great - if you could find a spot but we had to drive around a bit until we found space - parking is at a premium. Our room service while delicious did take longer than the 15 - 20 minutes quoted - more like 35 minutes and I had to ask for a pot of tea twice at breakfast but really I wouldn't usually worry about such trivial things but I want to give balance and I had to think hard for a criticism. Would I recommend this hotel - absolutely - the shopping within 1 minute's walk is without equal - DJ's, Myer, Westfield, Designer Labels, Pitt Street Mall, heaps of eateries and things to do. Did I mention the park opposite the Hotel with the beautiful fountain, gardens, wildlife and the cathedral and the domain - No????

I flew into Sydney from Dubai, first class, arrived in a limo to the hotel (looking a bit out of whack from the flight) upon arrival at the front desk the agent threatened to call the police on me, and yelled at me to leave. Experience number one. This was a mistake, but nonetheless not the way to treat a customer at a five star property. Since then I stayed a few times, and they were ok. I enoy the executive lounge, as some of the staff there are top notch. Recently things have been another story. I stayed in October of this year. When I checked in I was sure to register my girlfriend who was working, and arriving later. When she arrived the staff were rude to her, did not offer her a key and shoved her away from the desk so they can accept the louis vuitton luggage carrying customer behind her. Management did not care about this and had no excuse at all.. I came back in December trying to give them another try for my girlfriend's birthday. She slept most the day as I was in the city taking care of business etc.. I came back to find that she has a skin reaction to the bedsheets. Someting was wrong with them. We were asked to pack up and change rooms. We did this what a hassle. I wanted a birthday cake for her, and turned to ordering a $48 cake. Now I suprise her with this cake to find that it was stale (hard inside) and well equivilent to what you would pay $1 for on walmart's expired food shelf. Lets move on to the next morning. Breakfast We wanted the booth so we can sit together, asked for this infront of the General Manager. Was denied and thrown in the back room where they were setting up for lunch. A few minutes later I saw the GM taking up one of the booths with a hotel employee. Mind you this booth was free when we were taken to our table. We try and enjoy the mediocre overpriced breakfast. Now that morning I sent off my pressing with the room attendent (I Get 2 Comped as a platinum, and I also booked the executive level too) I sent off a few shirts, as I needed them pressed for work the next day. When I returned to my room they were left on the bed in a bag, not completed. I checked out, and the girl at the front desk didn't care at all. I needed these pressed. I told her that she was to take them and get it done. She wasn't too happy with this (I ended up buying a shirt at Myer) Now the kicker on the stay. We were moving into an apartment which wasn't ready till'10pm. I asked to extend my key for the executive lounge (Mind you I paid with points for the executive lounge, and I am a platinum member) The girl said in a cold manner absolutly not. Now I spend about 300+ nights in hotels, all high end, and no where I was denied lounge access after checking out.. She didn't care, wouldn't get me a manager nothing. Luckily We followed someone up to the floor and a employee who knows me took care of us.. But it seems the girl at the desk found out and tried to send me a bill.. We had a couple drinks in the lounge (making up for the fact that we weren't able to take advantage due to the illness brought on by the bed the night before) I told them I would stay another night, and proceeded to leave the hotel, and not return. This hotel is poorly managed, the management could care less for the end consumer. Any problems will not be fixed, nor compensated. Between the bedbugs (or whatnot) the stale $48 cake, not doing my laundry needed for work etc. They still managed to give me a big F U as I walked out. I won't waste my time complaining as I know they won't care. This hotel is overpriced, everything is mediocre. The staff doesn't care for the customers. There are plenty great hotels in Sydney. Hotels that will take care of you.. If you just want an overpriced bed that may have a good view go ahead and stay at the Sheraton on the Park.

Quite simply, this is the single best hotel experience we've ever had.

Practically a walk-in with a huge bench inside of it that was big enough so you could lay your suitcases out on it! The bed was very very comfortable. The location is perfect, and I feel it's even a better location than Darling Harbour.. it was easy walking distance to everywhere and was practically right on top of a metro station.

We had booked a park view room, which is a higher rate than ciry view rooms. Hot buffet breakfast was included. We had requested a high level floor, king bed and late check out. I advised them it was for birthday celebrations. Check in was after 3pm, it was quiet when I arrived so the check in process was very smooth. Reception was friendly enough. I had to remind them of our request for late check out, they advised they could do to 12 (normal check out is 11am) and after 12 will be a charge. This is usually standard practice across hotels like this, so I was happy with that. Room was on the 7th floor, so not high at all (the room type we had booked start on 6th floor) so didn't manage to get a high room as per request. The view was also not what I would consider a park view room and didn't warrant the higher charge (see pics for the actual view from the room). Because of the shape of the building you're actually looking in on other rooms and if on low floors other rooms can look down into yours, and the only park view you had was if you twisted your head and peeked out the side of the windows. The room was lovely and spacious. What you would expect from a 4 star hotel, large entrace way with bathroom off to the right. Full mirror opposite. The bathroom was very large, all marble, seperate bath and shower. Only thing I would mention is the doors to the bathroom were two sliding doors that didn't meet in the middle, so if you're looking for privacy/quiet when doing your business in the bathroom, you won't find it here! Also beware the shower door, it didn't close completely and was easily flooded. A towel shoved against the door seemed to stop any overflow though and we didn't flood the carpets (as had obviously happened in the past, due to the water stains flowing from the bathroom all the way into the room!!). The decor was pleasant, nice touches such as the framed art and lightbox, chess table and cosy couch in the corner made it feel a little warmer than some of your standard big chain hotels. Fridge in room which is always a bonus. Bed was king size and very comfortable - nice selection of pillows (hard or soft) and great that it was an acutal king size bed too, not the two singles put together which often happen. I called guest services on arrival to ask for more towels to be delivered to the room, which were delivered very efficiently with a smile, so impressed with service - also service in the breakfast room was great the next morning. Free newspaper outside room as expected with a 4 -5 star hotel. Express check out made it super easy to leave the next day, just drop the form and keys in the box near elevators and you're done. Common areas were clean, spacious and comfortable - the restaurant for the buffet breakfast wasn't too crowded at 8.30 on a Sunday morning, which was good. The food was slightly above average hotel buffet food, however would have liked to see the food in covered dishes instead of constantly exposed. Location is a HUGE plus for this hotel, located directly next to hyde park in Sydney with David Jones, Westfield, Myer literally around the corner. This is the premier shopping district for Sydney city, so it was super easy to get around - spend way too much shopping and drop the bags back at the hotel before heading out for the night - perfect! If you are a tourist in Sydney wanting to experience more cultural/tourist attractions you may prefer a hotel in the Circular Quay or Rocks area, however as I'm a local and know the city well, the location was perfect for my weekend of shopping, dining, shows, etc. It's also directly across from the St James station, so very easy to get around via train. Over all a great comfortable experience, what I would expect from this quality of hotel. Nothing above and beyond though, but the location and ease of my stay means I would certainly consider this again. If the room was on a higher floor and had an actual view of the park and they had offered something for the birthday celebrations (honeymooners get a comp bottle of wine) it would have probably been a more special stay, but can't complain.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cSome issues\u201d", "Author": "TravellingLuv", "ReviewID": "UR89647734", "Content": "The Sheraton on the Park is an okay hotel. Not excellent but good. There were several small issues that taken on their own would have been okay, it just that there were multiple small issues. First of all the hotel is in a great location. Very central in the city and close to a lot of shopping and food. The rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping was prompt. Here are some of the issues I encountered. When I checked in, the bell desk took my bag and said they would take it up to my room. After I went to my room, it took 2 phone calls and 45 minutes to finally get my bag to me. The shower in my room was not working 100% as some of the holes of the shower head were blocked. Room service menu is not very comprehensive, and when we ordered a pizza and a bowl of chips at about 11pm, the chips were dehydrated and the pizza was soggy. I don't mind paying for room service, but if you are going to charge 5 star hotel prices for in room dining, the food should also be up to that standard. I don't think stale chips are quite acceptable. The hotel beds are a little too soft, but that's more a personal preference I guess and not an issue per se. Check out is also an issue. It is disorganised. There is no queue system because the check in/check out area stretches across the entire right wall. I was waiting in line behind another guest checking out and when it got to my turn, the lady serving behind the desk went over to the far end of the counter from me to get some paperwork and got hijacked by another person checking out. I was queue jumped by 2 people in the check out process. Having said that, the staff are actually quite friendly. All in all it was just an okay experience, I was a little underwhelmed. As I said, if I had experienced any one of these issues in isolation, I would be a bit more forgiving in my review, but when they happen all in the space of 48 hours, it doesn't make for a 100% happy customer.

Upon arrival, the very disinterested receptionist told us our room would be ready in half an hour. A bit annoying, but acceptable I guess. Our room was on the 7th floor (not a high floor). We headed to the business lounge on level 21 (included in our room rate) and my husband spoke to the lovely staff there. They told us that our room would not be ready until 6pm because the guest wasn't checking out until 4pm! We were horrified! It was only 2pm and I needed my room desperately. The original receptionist should have informed us of this instead of exagerring! When we asked the original receptionist if there was another room we could have, she said they were full. We also asked if the standard room with 2 single beds we had booked could be changed to a King bed, she said there were none available. She just didn't care. Funnily enough, the lounge staff promptly found us exactly what we wanted. They said there were plenty of rooms! They gave us some full buffet breakfast vouchers which was generous. We were unable to use the 5 vouchers each morning because of the visits to hospital etc. so they were wasted. Each voucher had a date on it. On our last morning 4 of us turned up to breakfast. We only had 3 vouchers as my mother accidentally took the others home! But we also offered them the 5 vouchers for the next day. We certainly weren't trying to get anything free! The young man at the buffet was SO RUDE! He ummed and aaghed whith a smug look on his face. My husband politely said that we weren't trying to get a free breakfast and that we could just head up to the executive lounge and have the continental breakfast included in our room rate. Another few minutes passed while he tried to decide what to do. It was embarressing! A female staff member walked up and said \"of course you can stay!\" He was just being difficult. Another staff member stood out at the dinner buffet. When we booked our table we were advised that in-house guests were $60 intead of the usual $100. Of course our bill said $100 each! When we queried the bill, the staff member (an Asian gentleman) looked angry with us. He was short with us and couldn't wait to escort us out! It was unbelievable. The dinner buffet is an absolute circus! It was packed and the staff were obviously busy and stressed. The hotel location is very good for shopping.

There is also a bus stop within 1 block which can also bring you to Circular Quay for free (bus 555), or bring you back. The hotel staffs are professional and the service is awesome. Great Attitude and always willing to help. The hotel has 6 brand new computer for guest to use, high speed internet. You can also bring you laptop to enjoy the free wifi. The room has internet too but you need to pay for it. Most importantly, we got upgraded to a king size bedroom. The room is huge, with a tub and a shower, and the most comfortable king size bed. This is important because after long day, the bed can actually help you get ready for the next day. The bed is huge for 2 and the pillows are soft too.

It's situated on level 21 & offers wonderful views. The decor is gorgeous, very opulent but also warm & inviting. The quality of food available in the Lounge is 1st class as is the service. We received an upgrade to breakfast daily in the restaurant (instead of the Club Lounge). Breakfast is buffet style and the choice of options & quality of food was amazing.

Sydney tips - If you are a coffee drinker like I am, skip the coffee shops. The 7/11 stores there have espresso machines with great coffee for $1.00. It was just as good as the $4.00 coffee from a coffee shop - Don't miss the bats in the botanical garden. They hang from the trees by day, and fly out by night. They are flying fox bats, and can have wingspans of 3-6 feet. - Buy your souviner t-shirts etc from Paddy Market near China town. The same stuff they sell in town at a fraction of the price. Go on on weekday (open Thursday to Sunday, and maybe Wed now also) as it is packed on weekends. -Visit the Oak Barrel bottle shop (wine store) down the street- on Elizabeth just past Liverpool if you are a wine drinker.

We arrived, had our bags immediately taken from us, we checked in straight away, and as soon as we had gotten into our room our bags were upstairs already. We were lucky enough to have access to the Club Lounge. This I would definitely recommend, it is well worth your money, the views are spectacular, and the service impeccable. We were treated like Kings and Queens, definitely the part which made staying at the Sheraton well worth it. The lounge gave us pre dinner drinks and canapes, which were really great, and just added a little something extra to our night. It offered us breakfast with toasts, three hot meals, fruit, cereal and yoghurts, as well as free internet access and coffee throughout the day. We did go down to the Continental breakfast one morning as it is complimentary with the lounge if you are down before 7, however I would say sleep in and go to the lounge instead, the service in the lounge is much better and the selection downstairs wasn't that exciting anyways. The only thing I would say that could improve the lounge would be the times for pre dinner drinks. It is open from 5 till 7.30, however till 8 or 8.30 would be more appropriate, and allows you more time to relax and get ready after your day out. The lounge closes at 9, which I think is way too early, and it's always nice to come back from dinner or wherever at night and be able to use the internet, relax and have a coffee. The rooms are great, with beautiful bathrooms which have a separate large glass shower, and a big bath tub. We chose a City Side room in the end, as it was slightly cheaper and figured we wouldn't be in the room much anyways, but after staying there, I would say spend a little bit more and get a park view room, the views from the City Side really weren't that flash, but considering we did have the lounge we didn't find this to be a problem. The fitness centre is great, much better than ones in other hotels I have been to, and all brand new. The pool was absolutely amazing. We went there at night the first time, and the lights in the pool along with the atmosphere were incredible with great views. There is a spa as well which is always relaxing, as well as a sauna and steam room. The only complaint I would have is that when we checked in the lady took my credit card, and told me she only needed it for security reasons, however she failed to tell me that there would be a $500 block on the card. Sure for many this is not a problem, and most would never even realise that it's gone as it does not show up on any transaction history, but for those who are students, like myself, $500 is a noticeable amount of money, and as I had no record of anything going out, I thought I had spent a lot more money than I really had! I was not happy with this, and for the future, people should be told where their money is going! Other than that, everything was perfect. Their is even a DVD machine in the room which worked out very handy for a relaxing afternoon of some True Blood! Great hotel, and from someone who has researched all hotels in Sydney very thoroughly, the Sheraton is the hotel with the most positive reviews, so to make it easy for you and to save you the hassle as it did me, the Sheraton is definitely the best pick for your stay in Sydney :) If you do get a chance during your stay, take a trip to the Shangri-La Bar on the 36th floor.

CHECK IN/OUT: I did not have any problems, I had a red eye so I arrived early in the morning (around 9:00 am or so) and my room was ready to my relief. My friend arrived about two hours later but her room was not available for a couple more hours...but that is her review to tell. ROOMS: The first room I had was spacious, love the bathroom-double sink, walk in glass shower with separate tub, lots of toiletries which were replaced daily. Overall very clean. The rest of the room was spacious (especially since I had it to myself). The second room I had during the end of my trip was on the Starwood floor and the room was a little bit nicer. Had a padded bench area across from the bathroom for my luggage which the first room did not have. It seemed a little bit more clean/updated and well kept. Both rooms had refrigerator's with flat screen t.v.'s. SERVICE: maid service was daily and effecient. On my last day I was fortunate to have a late check out and after that was able to store my luggage before my late flight out. Concierge was helpful but often times on the phone heping other customers so sometimes you had to wait a while. FOOD: did not eat in the hotel but I did have a cup of Max Brenner hot chocolate (YUM!) for $8 a cup..... LOCATION: could not be beat. Central shopping district and within walking distance to restaurants and stores to pick up food, water, snacks. Great stay in a great city and would definitely return!", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore", "Title": "\u201csleep wasn't good\u201d", "Author": "michiruo", "ReviewID": "UR71203205", "Content": "Everything about this hotel is good till bedtime. No big complaints but just wanna share my experience. Spent 4 nights at sheraton and was given a room on the low 6th floor facing hyde park and the bus stop. If U are a light sleeper with the traffic, it could be a disturbance especially to my husband. I tried to change to higher floor but all rooms are full and the only available room is on the 9th floor or the suite (too expensive). And since both side of the hotel is facing the street, there will definitely be some noise. With only 3 floors up, I thought there will be no difference any way. However, my next door neighbour was another additional noise pollution. I believe there are at least 2 girls or more in a group staying on the same floor. For consecutive 3 mornings, they woke up at 6plus with the merry morning greetings which could be heard clearly through the connecting doors. For the next 15 mins or so, alot of dins and dongs going on with a nice ending of a loud slamming of the room door. To be fair, the slamming is not their fault cos usually when we leave the room, the room door will close on its own. However, the door always close with a loud thud. Unfortunately, incident like this happens to us.

When I worked in the city (sydney) I use to walk pass this place and think wow so posh and thought it was cold. But I was wrong. Me and my partner decided to have a getaway for our 9 year anniversary December 19 2009. We chose this hotel because we knew the Sheraton brand had great reputation and for the 5 star rating. I had went online checked the website and got a deal called \"Suite for a room\" which was $399. When we walked in, we were greeted by a very warm genuine concierge and they had the Christmas decorations up which made the place feel like you walked into a palace decked out with christmas lights and trees. The check in staff were so pleasant and helpful. Check in was quick and efficient. When we arrived in our room 1717 I was surprise that we had gotten the room which was in the centre of the hotel and the views were absolutely great. The sitting area for the suite was very spacious and the bed was king size and very very comfortable. The cleanliness of the room was perfect. It has a big marble bathroom. Back to the views, you could see Hyde Park, Eastern Sydney Suburbs, Water Views towards Rose Bay. The room had two great size plasma and superb TV reception. We also used the spa and fitness facilities and the staff there were absolutely great, my partner had a massage and told me that the massage room had great city views. while he was having a massage I treated myself for a swim. Sheraton On the Park by far has the best location for indoor heated pool, being it is on the very top floor of the hotel and has glass windows to see the city skyline. Also has a balcony area for you to sunbake. The location is great, close to pit street mall, hyde park (across the road) Botannical gardens, circular quay, centrepoint tower and also many other boutiques, bars and restaurant.

So far I have been impressed with this hotel, the rooms are beautiful the staff friendly and efficient. I flew in from LAX at 6:30 in the morning and they allowed me an early checkin. The room is very nice sized and the bathroom is beautiful, large and well maintained. The location of the hotel is excellent, all of my work is in Chatswood, which I reach by a 20 minute train ride from Town Hall station only a few blocks away. The only bad thing that has happened is a drunk in the room next door was singing loudly until past midnight. He finally stopped before I went to bed so I never called to complain. But obviously that is not the hotels fault. The only other issue I have is with the internet speed, in your rooms they charge 70+ dollars for 3 nights (I get mine free because of my company). For that price I would expect decent speed. But I get less than 1MBs, and during peak hours well below that. I am an engineer, and am always pulling documents from my servers in the US so this is very annoying. They have free WiFi in the lobby, but I haven't had occasion to use that. I am a SPG Gold member, my company was recently acquired and my travel choices are now defined by my new company. Previously I tried to stay in Marriotts and was a Platinum member with them. Last year alone I spent 192 nights in Marriotts, and was always treated very well for my status. Even when I was a gold member I would get room upgrades and welcome gifts. So, while this hotel is very nice I am thinking of moving to a Marriott nearby where my Platinum status will get me a better room and access to the club. I would highly recommend this hotel for most people.

Let's start with the good things, - Superb location, across the road from Hyde Park, next door to David Jones and the boutique stores, as well as St James train station (although if you have a pram, you need to be very strong to carry down the stairs). - Friendly staff, both the reception desk and the executive club lounge staff are very helpful, check-in, check-out very smoothly. Even thought we were only there for 2 days, on the second day staff at the breakfast service already remembered our coffee/tea preference. - Beautiful indoor swimming pool at the top floor with glass ceiling, child friendly. - Room is spacious and clean. Now the disappointing factors, - Most of the other hotel's executive clubs are available all day, Sheraton's executive club offers breakfast 7-10 (10:30am on weekends and public holidays), 2pm-4pm afternoon tea (very limited menu), 5pm-7pm for pre-dinner cocktail, after 7:30pm you'll have to pay for the drinks, and it shuts at 9pm. We found this rather restricted. - When we made the booking, we requested for a cot in the room, but when checking-in at 7pm on the day, there was no cot in the room. After phoning customer service, it was delivered to us within 15mins. I just don't expect Sheraton would make mistakes like this. - The room seems a bit tired, bathroom doors don't shut completely, one of the window shutters was broken. - Housekeeping didn't refill the mouth wash and vanity pack after cleaning the room - The hotel has one ramp entrance for disabled and pram access, but it's on the far side of the hotel. When I push the pram down the 4-5 steps, none of the concierge came to help, although a few times there were a couple of them at the front door, that was a bit poor form.

The hotel staff was excellent and very attentive to our needs. The room was set up very tastefully, and offered a nice view of the Hyde Park and St. Mary's Cathedral. The black marble bathroom was superb, and so were the bathroom supplies. When we made our reservations at this hotel, we didn't have a very good idea about the map of Sydney and the relative location of the hotel. Being to Sydney and staying at this hotel, we now know how brilliant of a location it has. All the great attractions of Sydney were amazingly close - we walked to the Botanical Gardens, the Opera House, the Harbour Bridge, Darling Harbour, the Sydney Fish Market, Kings Cross (the Coca Cola sign), and the Town Hall. And of course Hyde Park is just beside the hotel. The only thing at the hotel that might be a little better was the concierge service. While they were always very eager to make reservations for us at restaurants, I expected them to be more knowledgeable about the places of interest around Sydney. Again, it might just be the specific folks that I talked to at the concierge desk... but that was the only non-positive thing about our entire stay.

The location of this hotel is quite ideal for shopping (if that's what's on your mind) - the back entrance of the hotel in particular will lead you straight to castlereigh street, and right across the road is the David Jones department store for men. Go through the arcade across the road from the hotel's back entrance and you'll end up on george street where Queen Victoria Building (QVB) shopping centre is. (tip: once you come out of george street, turn left and onto HSBC to get your money changed for a good rate; they use travelex but it beats the other currency exchange place closer to the hotel). and their rates are available online. The monorail stop in Galleries Victoria is also accessible via castlereigh street (walk out the back entrance and turn left, it'll be to your right just have to cross the road). The rooms of the hotel are well appointed as what the other reviewers have said and are quite generous in size. the decor is really pleasant and i really liked the wooden blinds touch - much better than your average heavy curtain pull. The bed was big and very comfortable. The bathrooms are large and stocked well with the little amenities that you find in most 3-5 star hotels. Although I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a plug for my blowdryer inside the bathroom (so had to use the mirror outside of the bathroom), but they did provide a good blowdryer for guests to use, none of that really weak/poor-excuse-for-a-blowdryer stuff. The only thing I would fault this hotel for was their average service. We checked in pretty late around 10pm and when the taxi pulled up in front there wasn't a bellhop to help with our luggage and I had to go inside the hotel and actually ask for help with our luggage. The receptionist was very cold and didn't give off a friendly vibe,although I may be knit-picking here since I'm very spoiled with the service we get in asian hotels. I guess it's just the difference in culture? The business centre in the lobby is very useful for those who want to do some quick facebook/email checking and printing (for free), and the breakfast is good (not great).

The room and bathroom were quite nice as expected for a 5 star hotel. Our first and subsequent visits to the Exec lounge were crowded and noisy with young families and limited food services. For example there was one slow 4 piece toaster for the entire lounge. On the second night we had room service which was fairly quick and the butter chicken and accompaniments were nice and tasty On checking out I found that the Exec Club didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t include internet in the room and it was only free whilst in the actual Exec Lounge and I was charged for two nights ($60 total) I pointed out the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbenefits\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 sheet I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been given gave the distinct impression that the Internet was free and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stipulate in Exec Club Lounge only.

There were others that clearly couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been restricted to the Exec Club but I gave up at that point as the Receptionist was clearly not interested. We then moved to the exit to get a taxi for the Airport and I pointed out to the Porter that our two suitcases were too big for a saloon taxi and could he get the estate car for us which was third in line (there were two other guests without bags waiting so no one would be concerned). He ignored me and called the next taxi driver in line. There followed a comical situation where bags were loaded and then unloaded by the Porter and despite the taxi drivers protestations the Porter attempted to close the boot on bags that were clearly well over the loading line. He eventually gave up and squeezed one large suitcase in the front of the taxi (after hitting the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door on the way in). I noticed the wheels on the bag made a significant dent in the passenger (leather) seat. Needless to say the taxi driver was not too happy.

I stayed here for 2 nights in November 2009. I got a bargain of a deal of $160 per night. This offer was advertised for only 3 days so I grabbed this opportunity to stay at this hotel. I arrived late in the evening and check in was fast and friendly. As I am a Starwood Preferred Guest (spg.com) member I got a room on a higher floor. Higher floors are dedicated to spg members. This meant less noise from the floors below. I was also given a room in the corner of the floor and it was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable with top quality bedding sheets and doonas etc. Everything was spotless when I arrived. The bathroom was also big enough to move around in. The shower is a walk in one - the only thing I would say is be careful when taking a shower. Your bath mat may get soaked by the time you finish and the floor will be very wet. You are provided with Sheraton's own brand shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soaps. There was a hairdryer in the closer / luggage storage compartment. The beauty of this hotel was that there was an ironing board and iron... with plenty of space to do any ironing. The minibar is small but items were expensive - you are better off going to a 7-Eleven or a supermarket and buying your own drinks and putting them in the fridge yourself to cool. Downstairs towards the back of the foyer, there is free internet available for 1 hour. The foyer is grand and very big, especially with the staircases. I will say that the food (breakfast at around $35AUD - cold items only) is pretty steep for what you get. I'm sure you can get breakfast around town for less than this. Nonetheless, it has an excellent view over the park. Buffet breakfast is served in the Botanica Restaurant and consisted of platters of fruit, pastries, breads, cereal. If you want the hot items (like eggs, bacon etc) I think this breakfast was $40-42AUD roughly. Location is excellent - across the road is the park and also St James train station. It was convenient getting from the airport at night when I arrived. A train ride from the domestic airport was $15 by train.

The executive club food service was much better than expected for breakfast with luxuries like smoked salmon and cappuccinos. It also included several hot options like scrambled eggs and sausage. The lounge had two computers that we could use with complimentary internet. We were disappointed to learn though that children are not ever allowed in the executive lounge after 5pm.

We learned about these rules in the lounge but later checked on the website. It's clearly posted on the hotel website so we wanted to point it out here as we had missed it. The hotel tells me that they are looking into ways to make guests aware of this rule. Apparently guests complained about children and they made this rule to accomodate business travel. I am certain that the rule makes it easier for business travelers but a challenge for those of us that are on vacation travel or a weekend visit.

It is not a full gym but is certainly extensive in comparison to a hotel gym and will allow a full body work out in a gym away from your home gym. Though this is a full thumbs up review, there is one major draw back at this property: The restaurants and bars are outrageously priced (about 30% more than same quality in NYC).", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fantastic hotel with great staff\u201d", "Author": "bazcalUk", "ReviewID": "UR53778411", "Content": "We stayed at the Sheraton over the new year period and we were very impressed with the staffs ability to cope with the busiest time of year.

This was the second visit to the hotel. I booked the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Surprise\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package online on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website which offered free parking and buffet breakfast. The room was great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c super huge with remote control blinds, lovely air conditioning and a marble bathroom. The breakfast buffet was top notch. Check-in involved a bit of waiting due to many guests checking out late as the night before had been New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve. Staff were a bit frazzled dealing with the queuing guests but this is understandable on what is the busiest night of the year in Sydney. The hotel offers free wifi for guests with laptops in an area adjacent to the lobby \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this is much appreciated and welcomed. The same area also contained about 5 computers free of charge for the use of guests. This number of computers was woefully inadequate for the size of the hotel. As I was one of the many guests who had brought their own laptop I myself was ok but the hotel needs to double the number of hotel-owned computers in the area for the use of guests. The hotel is in a great location adjacent to the Pitt Street Mall area of Sydney which is the main shopping centre of the city. There is a high quality delicatessen/upmarket grocery store underneath the David Jones Market Street store which is great for a snack or if you feel hungry within 50 metres of the hotel. The hotel is an easy 10 minute stroll from the Opera House and Circular Quay area in a very safe section of the city adjacent to Hyde Park. Regarding things to do in Sydney, I highly recommend taking a Seaplane ride around Sydney Harbour. These leave from Rose Bay which is a 12 minute cab ride from the hotel and the flight costs about $130. This is an unforgettable experience \u00e2\u20ac\u201c make sure you take the package that flies over Bondi Beach as well. You can also have lunch in Rose Bay at a stunning waterfront restaurant called Catalina before or after your seaplane ride \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is right next to where the seaplanes take off. Both the food and the views are fabulous at this restaurant. Also highly recommended is lunch or dinner at Doyles restaurant Watson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Bay - fantastic views and food. Bondi Beach is an absolute must but stay away from the Iceberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the food is awful despite the restaurant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s great views of Bondi Beach. Make sure you do what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known locally as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bondi to Bronte walk\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This is a lovely scenic walk from Bondi Beach to Bronte beach which takes in lovely coastal views. Allow half an hour there and half an hour back. Once you reach the Bronte end there are some cafes you can sit and have a coffee at before heading back. You can also admire some pricey real estate along the way. For shopping make sure you go to the Westfield Bondi Junction, accessible directly by train from the Sydney CBD or also by Cab \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about a 15 minute drive max from the Sydney CBD or 12 minutes by train. This is arguably the best shopping mall in Australia and is where the locals shop with everything you could possibly wish for under one roof including a plethora or restaurants and eating outlets. Also visitors to Sydney should make sure they go on a Captain Cook cruise (they leave from Circular Quay) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I went on a Cocktail cruise that left at 5pm and this is highly recommended but they have cruises leaving all day long. Make sure you stop at the Guylian Caf\u00c3\u00a9 at Circular Quay for a light sandwich and top quality cakes with recipes derived from Belgian bakers. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a few minutes walk from the Opera House. Other musts are Cockle Bay Wharf and King Street Wharf \u00e2\u20ac\u201c don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother going to the Harbourside shopping mall at Darling Harbour, it is just a giant tourist trap full of downmarket stores, good for souvenir shopping but nothing else. It is solely a tourist mall, no Sydneysider would be caught dead shopping there. For real shopping go to the Westfield Bondi Junction. The Lindt Caf\u00c3\u00a9 at Cockle Bay Wharf has amazing light meals and cakes, yes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s owned by the famous Swiss chocolate company Lindt and they have another branch at Martin Place in the CBD which is also good. Another must is the Wharf at Woolloomoolloo which is a 5 minute cab ride from the CBD \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is a string of upmarket waterfront restaurants there frequented by locals. Dinner at Otto\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is great (a reservation is required). One final tip - ladies don't even think of stepping out in Sydney without a high SPF sunscreen on your face underneath your makeup and make sure you put sunscreen on your shoulders and arms. Bring a hat with you too. Many tourists grossly underestimate the strength of the Australian sun even the exposure you get from just walking around all day. One final note - when I checked my credit card statement online two weeks after my stay I discovered that the hotel had charged me twice for the room by mistake. A second charge appeared 6 days after I checked out. A quick call to the hotel and the matter was swifty fixed. So check your credit card statements lest it happen to you. Note that the hotel politely and apologetically fixed the problem. Sydney is a wonderful city and the Sheraton on the Park is a great hotel which puts you smack bang in the heart of everything in a safe and upmarket location. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great base from which to explore Sydney.

Happy to respond again to a hotel. I am in hotels for good 80% of nights in a given year and I really know my way around. What I like about this hotel is the location at the park. It just gives it a nice touch to it. The atmosphere at check in/out is professionally cool and albeit being SPG Gold Member it recognition isn't that great. The room is very nice and spacey. The bed is to soft (not a problem of the hotel probably) and wasn't comfortably to me. They offered my daughter a roll in bed, but we settled for the sofa in the room. My daughter was ok sleeping there. However, in taking a look at the sofa and pulling up the pillows we found a room key card, paper, and other staff in there, which the cleaning girl did not see from a prior guest. At our late arrival we wanted to eat in the coffee shop and the checkin said we should try it at the bar and if there is no one go to McDonalds (\"sometimes they close early\"). Ok we could have tried room service, but settled for McD and had in the lobby - like many, many other people. The rooms - while nice and large - are loud though. On one night I wanted to go the gym and as it was close, they offered to have a security person open it up for me. I did that and I appreciate the effort. For the New Years Eve dinner went to the hotel buffet. That food was really not good and I highly not recommend eating in. Taste, Selection, and Quality was really below standard. My complaint has not been answered on that day, but I specifially had to mention it during check out after which I got an email cc;ed to 10 people with the question what was so bad (well check the written feedback I gave on the day) ...

We wrote politely to the hotel to ask if there could be any flexibility with its cancellation policy (like allowing us a credit on the hotel for a future visit), and the reply was cold from the reservation manager, effectively saying 'we're sorry you know someone who's dying, there's nothing we'll do about our cancellation policy and you'll have to forfeit the full ~A$2,000 but we do welcome you back with us on another fully paid for stay when your family member miraculously doesn't have cancer anymore.' We wrote again to both the hotel reservation manager, and the hotel general manager via the Starwood worldwide guest service. Both refused to address our question and concerns anymore and to them it was the end of communication. Eventually. someone from the Starwood worldwide guest service wrote back and told us 'the case is closed and sorry if you disagree with our decision'. The day before our stay was supposed to begin, we found the pastor of an uncle in Australia who would be interested in a short holiday in Sydney. He sensibly called the hotel to double-check on our reservation before he embarked from Canberra, but the hotel said there was no record of our booking (our reservation vanished on SPG.com too, the Starwood website where we booked). So of course the pastor didn't leave Canberra that day, and one night stay was totally wasted before the hotel finally got back to us to say the reservation was good and 'sorry about the earlier confusion'. We never cancelled our reservation, so how come the hotel and Starwood group's reservation systems seem to be in such disarray? I understand a hotel's operations pretty well from my line of work. I understand hotel room nights are perishable goods, and the fact that the Sheraton on the Park was offering cut-price rates on Expedia 10 days before new year's eve would suggest the hotel was not fully sold out and hence it was keen to hold on to the A$2,000 revenue we were made to forfeit. I could read the cancellation policy myself and technically one can say the hotel was just doing everything by the book and there was nothing wrong with that. However, was that even a human response? Did the hotel think the trade-off of A$2,000 RevPAR right now, against the potential business from two frequent travellers for the entire Starwood group of properties for the next 40-50 years is a good trade? There are more than enough 5-star hotel groups in any city we'll be travelling to, and I hope the Starwood managers do understand that simple fact. We also wrote to the Sydney Opera House to explore re-selling our confirmed new year's eve midnight party tickets, explaining our predicament. The Sydney Opera House almost replied right away and said it was willing to make an exception, and gave us a full refund. It didn't have to do that but it won a lot of goodwill with us as a result. Brand equity is a fickle commodity and easily destroyed; by behaving the way it did, the Sheraton on the Park management just managed to destroy any brand equity it has with us, for the entire Starwood group. That's cheap negative advertising it just had, for a mere A$2,000. It was just shocking how the management team there perceived its guest relationship.

We used the 555 free circular route bus (thanks to another review for that tip!) to get down to Circular Quay, and it's only a 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour. We stayed on the Club floor, which represented excellent value. Sometimes Club floors are a bit of a con - with minimal services and refreshments, but this was not one of those. The buffet breakfast was kept fresh for the entire 2.5 hours of service, as were the hot and cold canapes in an evening. The staff made sure you were never without drinks and were without exception polite and courteous (another first for a Sydney hotel, in my experience). If I had one downside, it would be the restaurants (as mentioned briefly earlier). There is the bar and the brasserie, and neither had appealing menus for me.

We got a great rate for a 3 night stay over a weekend, and did not at all get the feeling that we were rattling around a half-full business hotel. The room was clean and spacious. A Park view would have been worth the extra perhaps, but how much time do you spend gazing out of the window in a place like Sydney? The location of the hotel is excellent - busy, but not too noisy, and in walking distance of just about anything a tourist would want to see. The breakfasts were huge and excellent, and worth including in the rate if you can as they're quite pricey as a separate item. There was a small problem with our door lock, which housekeeping thought was defective, though it seemed OK to us. The cheery guy from maintenance worked tirelessly to get it right, apologising all the while. Although reception wanted to move us, they accepted our decision to stay put whilst the door was fixed (it was raining outside, so we had nothing better to do). Once the job was finished and we did go out, we returned later in the day to find a bottle of waiting for us, with the compliments of the hotel for the \"inconvenience\" we had suffered. As further evidence of the human touch (yes, at a Sheraton!), during the previous evening at dinner, we mentioned whilst chatting to our server that it was our wedding anniversary.

(Although I would recommend getting Club lounge upgrade for some of your stay and make one day where you eat in the Brasserie as the breakfast buffet there is truly spectacular, albeit expensive at $40.)

The hotel was all paid for, but I called the hotel beforehand to firstly, check that they had the booking and secondly, to inform them that my parents wouldn't have a credit card at all when checking in, would that be a problem? No, that wouldn't be a problem at all, everything was fine. I spoke to my parents earlier today to see if they had arrived safely and was everything OK. My Mum said they everything was great, the room was lovely, both very happy....except that there was a bit of a problem when they were checking in that left her a bit flabbergasted. On arrival at the hotel my parents were asked for their credit card, when they explained they didn't have one, they were asked for a cash deposit of $300 per night for 3 nights, $900 AUD in total. Basically everything they had on them to enjoy the next three days. When they explained that they didn't really have that kind of money to spare, that they could give them $300 for that night and then try and work something out, they were told that was hotel policy, nothing they could do, they needed $900 AUD asap, deal with it basically. My poor parents have had to call my sister in Adelaide, who had to spend the next hour, running around scanning credit cards and photo ID to fax to the extremely unhelpful girl, Catherine, at reception to secure their booking, as they wouldn't take my sister's credit card details over the phone. I feel so sorry for my parents that this was the start of their little trip away, they tried not to let it bother them, but they were so embarrassed by the whole situation. They just weren't expecting that reception, especially since I had told them that I had called the hotel, checked everything, and they were good to go. My sister and brother-in-law even organised a special car to pick them up from the airport, it was meant to be a real treat. I have since called the hotel to sort the situation out and to thank them so much for making my parents welcome to Sydney so memorable for all the wrong reasons. My Mum even asked me not to call the hotel to complain because she was mortified, that they would try and sort it out. Why? Why when I rang the hotel to check this very fact was I not told that a cash deposit would be required, a cash deposit of $300 AUD no less, per night, a ridiculous amount of money, more than I think I paid for the room!!! May I recommend that hotel staff may be do some retraining on dealing with people that aren't on business trips; that aren't regular travellers; that don't have credit cards and learn how to treat their GUESTS with humanity and respect. Carl, the duty manager I spoke to was most helpful in sorting everything out, and strangely enough, was able to take my credit card details over the phone as security, after all my sister's running around scanning and having to go to the post office to fax her details! The rest were as good as useless by the sound of things. The deposit my parents paid was returned to them whilst they were in their room, I was hoping they may also have had the courtesy and compassion to bring them a bottle of wine or something by way of apology and to get their trip back on track, but no.

I checked in after a very long flight from Canada, and seriously jetlagged and having been awake for about 40 hours straight, I wanted to go to bed early. I was in my room at about 6pm and noticed it was very cold, despite the fact I had the heat turned up full. I got on a chair and confirmed the vents were sending out cold air. I called downstairs at 6:40pm to advise of the problem and told them I wanted to go to sleep....they assured me someone would be up to fix it soon. About an hour later, and struggling to stay awake, I called again. A half hour after that, I called again. About 9pm an engineer showed up, tried to fix it, and in the process a terrible burning smell filled the room. A housekeeping staff member was sent up with an air purifier to remove the burning smell from the room. At about 10pm, I was advised it could not be fixed and I would have to change rooms. I had been awake 46 hours straight at that point, had 5 very heavy bags, and told them I could not physically manage a room change and asked them to bring me extra blankets. The next morning, they organized my room change....I re-packed my bags, and when I was in the middle of dragging them between the rooms, I was locked out of the first room and had to arrange to be let back in to remove the rest of my stuff. Finally, I got myself into the new room, unpacked, started making some phone calls, had the heat up high (I'd frozen the night before), but after a couple hours noticed the room was very cold....I got on a chair, checked the vent, and noticed cold air was pumping out. I called downstairs again....another engineer was sent up, he confirmed the heat was broken in this room too and would take hours to fix, and I had to move rooms again (3 rooms in less than 24 hours). When I complained to the manager, I was given a comped breakfast and some other small credits (I believe $77 in total)....when I said I was still not happy and would have preferred to have had some sleep, the manager sent up a tea tray with oranges. A few days ago (I've now stayed 9 nights), after discovering that the SPG rate was more expensive than the expedia rate on a particular night, I approached the front desk, advised them of this and asked whether or not SPG had a Best Rates Guaranteed program....I was told they did not and that I would have to book through Expedia to get that rate, which I did. Every day I checked who had the better rate, and for 3 nights I booked through Expedia. Today I found out that SPG do have a Best Rates Guaranteed program, and that the rate should have been matched by SPG and I should have received 2000 points each time Expedia had a better rate. When I called SPG to complain, they basically told me it was too late to do anything about it and they would contact the hotel manager so that it didn't happen to other people. I went to see the front desk manager (a woman) and by way of explanation, was told by her that the junior staff don't know about these things. I told her that was no excuse and they should have asked someone more senior rather than tell me the program didn't exist. She wanted to know if I had kept screen shots of the rates...I said \"of course not\", as I had been told there was no best rates guranteed program. She said all she could do was tell another manager who might contact me later today. Now it looks like I'll have to lug my luggage to another hotel. So much for valuing a guest who has stayed 9 consecutive nights in your hotel! Re the rooms, they are ok and tastefully furnished. Housekeeping has been great, and the staff at the breakfast buffet are the very very best! I've been eating at that buffet for about 10 years, but won't be staying in the hotel again. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels, worked at the Four Seasons many years ago, and what I have encountered here is not even close to what I'd expect from 5 star. This is not the first problem I've had with Sheratons....after a stay at the Toronto Sheraton (separate review will be posted shortly), a couple of months later I noticed my credit card had been charged for 3 consecutive nights and meals, at a time when I was on the other side of the country. I assumed someone had stolen my card number and was using it there unlawfully....I contacted the hotel to advise them and had to cancel my card and have a new one couriered over, at my expense, from Australia (I had no access to money for days while I waited for the new card). Eventually they admitted their mistake (not stolen, just a stupid accounting department) and the charges were reversed and I was given 20 000 points. I was not reimbursed my courier expenses etc, which were over $100. A friend of mine had the same thing happen to him when he stayed at the Sheraton 4 points in Arizona....he is still waiting for a reply from the hotel many months later.", "Date": "July 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cWell located, luxury hotel\u201d", "Author": "TITraveller", "ReviewID": "UR33836644", "Content": "In years past, the Hilton Sydney (pre-two year refurbishment) was our venue of choice.

The fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the hotel facing the park is really more of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd shape in some areas so several rooms which are marketed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153park view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms really have more of a view directly across to the rooms on the other side of the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153U.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Yes, you can put your head up to the window and see part of the park but I think it is probably not a fair proposition to sell those inward-facing rooms as true \u00e2\u20ac\u0153park view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms. Much like hotels on a beach perhaps a middle category of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153partial park view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room would be a good idea for this hotel in addition to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153park view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153city side\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which seem to be only two room categories. Looking at the 15th floor (I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if all floors are the same) here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how it seemed to break out: Full direct park view: 1512-1516, 1530-1533 Partially obstructed park view: 1517-1520, 1526-1529 Facing rooms on opposite side of hotel: 1521-1525 If you are paying for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153park view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room, and the view is important to you, I would suggest not arriving too late in the evening only to be stuck with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153whatever is left\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in the room category. Chances are you will be disappointed. The Executive Club Lounge was very nice and the staff helpful and friendly. The lounge is on the 21st floor of the hotel yet not all \u00e2\u20ac\u0153club level\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd rooms are actually on floor 21. The other club level floors appear to be 15 and 16. Card key access is required to move between floors in the hotel and also to enter the club. The club hours are 7am to 9pm with complimentary cocktails from 5:00p-7:30p. The breakfast selection could use some improvement; there is traditional continental breakfast fare and three hot items served daily (the hotel calls this service \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Continental Plus.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) The problem is the three hot items were virtually the same every day with only minor differences in presentation. It would not seem to be too much trouble to mix-up at least the hot item selection so guests staying 2 or more nights don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the same thing each morning. There is free WiFi access in the lounge (it costs AUD$29.95 per 24 hours in the room) and the club staff were most pleasant. The health club, on floor 22 of the hotel, was well equipped and complimentary to Starwood Preferred Guest members. Housekeeping at this hotel was very efficient and, even as a continuing guest, there was never any trouble getting our room cleaned when it was most convenient for us. With service cutbacks so prevalent in the industry I have found that, if you are not checking out, it does seem housekeeping comes later and later in the day after the rooms being turned-over are first cleaned. I did find it unusual for a hotel of this level that you have call each day to request evening turndown service but, once the call was made, the turndown service was prompt. Also, if you want a newspaper you need to put a card on your door indicating you would like a paper delivered in the morning. Again, I was a bit puzzled by these extra-required steps which are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153automatic\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at most similarly situated business properties. Needless to say the first day we missed both turndown service AND our morning paper (not a big deal\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but worth a mention here in case these services are important to you). A few notes on the actual room: the exterior windows do not open at all (not even a small crack for fresh air), the shower heads were high and had very good pressure, and the HVAC system was quiet and efficient. The TV has very limited channels but does include the CNNI, BBC World, CNBC and the Australian national networks. I would say this hotel is an excellent choice for both business and pleasure. The location, slightly away from the hustle of the Circular Quay and directly across the street from the St. James train station, is ideal to be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for a visit to Sydney but not too much \u00e2\u20ac\u0153in the action\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where you have to put up with tour busses and cruise ships.

I needed to be central, and usually prefer to stay in smaller/boutique hotels. But I did a lot of digging around and decided I needed a hotel that was pretty central to everything, so I wouldnt be trekking around in less reputable parts of town, or more suburban areas, alone at night, etc. Always plenty of people around, taxis etc but without being stuck in some Business District. This met my expectations - it is opposite the lovely leafy Hyde Park; across the park is the Art Gallery and then further along the gardens open out onto the coastline. I jogged every morning through the park, up to Lady Macquarie's Chair, along the seawall of the Botanic Gardens, up to the Opera House, around it and back through the Gardens themselves. What a way to start the day! On the day it rained, I used the very nice hotel gym on the 22nd floor, where you can stand on the balcony and take in the view while you have your well-earned post-workout drink... I arrived early in the mornign and the staff were great, giving me access to the health suite to have a shower, etc and stored my bags for me. When I returned much later that afternoon my bags were in my room. The room was great- exactly as you would expect from a large reputable 'chain' hotel in this part of the world. I travel a lot in Asia and this was on a par with a decent similar hotel in HKG or SIN. Large room with all the usuals - nice llarge comfy bed, desk, etc. Decent walk-in wardrobe. Lovely big bathroom with separate walk-in shower and lots of space. Great space to call home for 6 days. I got a fab deal - would never have stayed there otherwise. 3 nights for price of 2. So my 6 night stay came in really reasonable. I didnt eat in the hotel - I found Sydney to offer a fantastic, diverse selection of great food places and very inexpensive to eat out. Drinks in the hotel bar were quite expensive, but sure, arent they all? Bambini Wine bar right next to the hotel - turn riight as you leave the foyer - is a great little place to hang out if you want to get out of the hotel but you dont want to venture too far. Lovely selectoin of wine and great vibe. Not sure it was at all cheaper than the hotel, but the environment/surroundings very nice indeed! Similarly, I would skip out the back door from the lobby to get my coffee and muffin the morning and bring it back to do my emails. Loads of small independent coffee shops at the base of the tower blocks in the street behind. Like all the best hotels, the wifi connection in the main lobby and bar areas of the hotel was free, so I was variously joined of an evening by fellow travellers who've also figured out that a short trip in the lift with their laptop can save them a small fortune. Why do hotels continue to insist on charging for in-room wifi?! Staff at the concierge, etc were also very helpful and friendly. I didnt really use any other facilities - although, word of warning - a friend from out of town left their car parked in the hotel garage overnight - from about 11pm til about 8am and they tired to charge him about $100. He declined to do so, obviously! Best to query it.... Sydney itself - what can i say? As a single travelling female, I felt pretty safe most of the time, except in the Kings Cross area, etc where I felt a little nervous when alone, but fine when with colleagues. Rest of the time - down near the harbour and wandering around the various areas of town, I felt very comfortable. I loved The Rocks. Dont forget the fab little markets that are on around town (great locations for purchasing unqiue momentoes) are only there on sat and sun - so plan your time accordingly! And get on some ferries and get out further afield - forget the touristy ones. Im sure they're great, but I used the network of 'commuter' ferries to get around and visit Manly etc. Great way to see the city.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hobart, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGet Breakfast in Your Rate\u201d", "Author": "zoshi", "ReviewID": "UR30409843", "Content": "Beautiful hotel in central location.

We are frequent visitors to Mandarin Oriental hotels, which should in theory be of a similar standard to the Sheraton on the Park. In reality, they are day and night. I would suggest that if the Sheraton wishes to maintain its 5* status, which is already dubious in my opinion, the senior mgt team should spend some time in a few of the Oriental hotels to find out how a proper 5* hotel should operate. The breakfast selection in the club room is very poor, and the evening food selection to accompany evening drinks was also pretty devoid of imagination. I would also suggest that the club could do with more staff, as service was at best slow. As an aside, I would suggest fitting a door to the kitchen area in the lounge, so guests cannot hear the staff swearing or complaining about the guests in the lounge.

You can end up on a hill overlooking the bay and the harbour bridge which is a nice treat to be out of the crowds on circular quay.

I went up to my assigned room which was a corner room on the 20th floor, with windows across the whole room with views of the city, the park and the harbor. Since I'm only SPG gold, I didn't think I was going to get a suite, maybe a bigger room with less of a view so I immediately asked to keep the room for the entire stay.

The only point I'd make is like some previous posters, porters inside the lobby did not exactly jump to help. I had a large bag upon checkout and three people stood around and watched me carry it out to the entryway. The porter outside did jump to get me a taxi and load my bags though. The health club is not included if you don't have status or a high level rate. It is very nice with a pool, decent number of machines, views, lockers, steam and sauna.

We had followed all the instructions and locked a laptop and passports inside. However we couldn't open it. Subsequently, the repairman came up and despite all attempts, could not open it. He then had to call the firm who supplied the safe, for help. Byt this time it was around 9.30 - 10.00pm. The safe company said we had to wait another 1/2 hour...which after a flight and a long day, we decided to wait until the next morning. The next morning, we followed up with hotel staff and went out saying that they could leave the items with front desk once the safe was opened. On our return 2 hours later they said they couldn't give us the items as they were with the duty manager. After subsequent follow up, we found that the safe still hadn't been fixed....they asked us to wait a little longer. We spent another 1+ hour hanging around...what a waste of time. Eventually it was fixed and the hotel said there was an electronic fault and several guests had the same problem. That's the end of it - at check out, they charged the telephone calls to the safe company, to us! (of course refunded). The duty manager, can't remember her name, was quite good about it ...but the receptionist at checkout, was sooooo insistent we had made calls from the room and wouldn't listen. Fortunately the duty manager was there at the time. (iii) Staff service and lack of it (maybe we are used to service standards in Asia) - at check in, I guess we didn't look 'posh' enough so we had to wait and wait although there was staff member standing at the Starwood guest section doing nothing until some well dressed ladies appeared behind us and offered to serve them - at breakfast, it was nearly impossible to get a waiter/waitress - at checkout, we wanted to leave bags until we left for the airport.

We arrived at the Hotel by booked limo to be greeted very nicely by porters. The limousine Company had obviously liased with the Airline and Hotel, which worked out fine as we were greeted on time at the Airport and also by name as we exited the vehicle at the Hotel (Hire Company is Royale limousines. Highly recommended) Reception The Hotel has a fantastic feel. A WOW factor, especially the foyer and majestic stairs that lead to upper levels. It oozes character. Michael on front of house operations was excellent, and obviously well versed in his role. He was so tentative toward us at every opportunity. Six lifts so no real wait for transport upwards! Room Suite was as advertised and booked online through SPG. (Starwood Hotels Clb) A Park View Terrace Suite on level 19. Spacious, comfortable, and well appointed. Bathroom/bath nicely designed, large, and clean. Well positioned for access from either the main bedroom or small entrance foyer to the suite. The King bed was nothing less than to die for. Absolute comfort and luxury for us. Very difficult to get out of bed for the next day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s activities! Lounge area OK, perhaps showing some age but nothing dramatic. Dusty entertainment area tops/side tables was noticeable. A little behind on housekeeping for a new long stay check in perhaps, but that is the only real problem. Seating and study area was comfortable. Lounge was a good size. Nice Terrace with fantastic views. Our suite being on Club level included access to the Executive Club on level 21. Very nice with private areas available. High Speed Internet if you are not on holidays. Great views over the harbour and park. Plenty of staff to assist every need. Breakfast offers three small but adequate hot options with the continental spread. Afternoon tea available, along with evening canap\u00c3\u00a9s\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and drinks after 5 pm daily. Pretty much what ever you want. So the club level accommodation costs are, I believe, worth it. Hotel room service is fine, meal options limited as one would expect, but are adequate and tasty. Remember it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room service, so much higher costs are involved for being a little lazy yourself! But what the hell it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holidays! Restaurants Botanica was pleasant. We only had one meal at breakfast and it was fine. The usual buffet fair and chef on hand to create your style of eggs or omelette. It was great. However, The Times on The Park steak house in the hotel on level one was our first evening meal in Sydney. Not the greatest experience. Food took forever to arrive, was not cooked to order, bread had to be returned as it was stale and like a rock! Slow service, really slow. Unfortunately the service was not that welcoming to anyone else either it seemed. Perhaps because it was Christmas Eve. Never the less, it should not happen. Rest assured it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not part of the Sheraton per say its independent. I would not recommend eating there. The Sheraton Hotel has other nicer areas to enjoy. Sheraton on The Park is close to all that one would need, including shopping, transport, restaurants and the obvious site seeing and water activities. Would we stay at Sheraton on The Park Sydney again? My word we would! Absolutely wonderful. 5 stars from us. Highly recommend the upper levels of accommodation and features for that bit extra. Either way, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fantastic Hotel to stay with. Next tour takes us to South Australia in April 2009. The Barossa and Adelaide City. Will advise when ready! Raise a glass! Cheers.

I agree with all of the positives noted by other reviewers and just want to add a few additional comments. We were traveling with our college age sons and booked a king room overlooking Hyde Park and a twin room with a \"city view.\" We arrived at the hotel around 10:30 AM, having just disembarked from a cruise. We were delighted to be greeted warmly at that hour and were able to check into the king room immediately, despite the official 3 PM check-in time. The twin room was available about an hour later. Both rooms (and bathrooms) were very spacious, attractively decorated, and extremely comfortable. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a charge for internet use in the room, but there is a small business center in the lobby area where computers can be used at no charge. Be aware, however, that the hotel charges by the page to use the printer -- even to print airline boarding passes -- and that you have to get the paper yourself from the front desk. This seemed unusual and something of an annoyance. It was our only negative experience at the hotel. On the positive side, I found the hotel staff extremely helpful in recovering some items that I left behind in the room. When we got home to the US and I unpacked, I realized that I had left a small bag containing several things purchased during our travels. I called the hotel and they quickly determined that my items had been found by housekeeping. I offered to pay to have the items mailed to me and the concierge desk was able to tell me the cost of several different shipping options. I chose air mail as the least expensive and am happy to report that my package arrived today with everything intact. Finally, although the hotel is not in the heart of the tourist district, we found it relatively easy to walk to Darling Harbour (about 5-10 minutes) and to the Circular Quay, the Rocks, and the Opera House (about 20 minutes). For those with mobility limitations, low energy, or small children, you should know that the walk is downhill going to any of the above locations and uphill coming back.

The Reception staff were pleasant and the check in service was efficient. The lobby is quite impressive but I did notice that the flowers arrangements behind the desk and by the lift were a bit dead looking and in need of changing. They were fresh the next day but I think the the hotel ought to consider changing them on a more regular basis as dead, ratty flowers bring down the tone. Curiously, the young woman at reception told me they were fully booked for the weekend - which I found interesting seeing as I had only booked the room a half hour ago (having walked out of the Establishment, where I was originally booked). I have no idea why she told me that. Perhaps it was just chit chat? They were awfully busy when I arrived. I would describe the room as reasonably clean; ie) it was not dirty enough for me to complain but it neither was it spotless. There was dust on some of the cabinets and the armchair was badly stained. A wine glass I wanted to use had grubby fingerprints - that sort of thing. I got the impression that this hotel is more geared for businessmen than for holiday makers because the room decor is quite masculine. Also, there was no drawer space whatsoever, There was only one sink in the bathroom and not much bench space for toiletries. For two women getting ready to go out this was not so good. I could see up through the top of the bathroom's sliding doors up into the ceiling and see the air conditioning pipes and insulation which I thought was pretty poor. Unfortunately the air conditioning does not tell you what temperature you are setting so we alternated between too hot and too cold which was a bit uncomfortable. Apart from that the room was quite nice with a lovely leafy green view of the park. It was larger than most hotel rooms I've stayed in in Sydney - around 40 m squared - which is good for two singles. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and the shower had amazing water pressure, which we really enjoyed. A good sleep in is something I also enjoy while I'm away but unfortunately, one of the cleaning staff entered our room on Saturday morning at around 8.30 am and woke us up. We had room service the first night. it was very good and arrived promptly. The buffet breakfast was also very good but ruined by the attitude of the duty manager who asked if we wanted coffee then poured one for me but not my friend and stomped off. The percolated coffee was dreadful - stewed and cold. We ordered flat whites instead. I don't know if we've been charged for this yet because I still haven't received my invoice by email. (We chose an express checkout because the hotel was very busy on Sunday.) We also had to queue for breakfast on the last day but not for too long. This hotel is in a very convenient location. We walked to the Art Gallery and also picked up some wine and snacks from David Jones, just around the corner. Overall I would describe the service as good but not outstanding and the room as comfortable but certainly not luxurious. The hotel is more 4 star. Definitely not 5 star for the reasons I've given, above. Our stay was OK but I really would have preferred to stay somewhere luxurious.

Everything about the hotel, for the most part, was very good. The room and bathroom were a pleasant surprise, as they were both very good sized. We had a king room with a roll away and had ample room to move around and spread out. For our stay, we booked a room that came with breakfast for two nights and used Starwood points for the other night. The only disappointing thing was that the view from the room was supposed to be a city view, however, from room 1108, it is an air conditioning and roof view. As gold members, we were told at check in that they were not changing our room for our stay, so we assumed that because we used points, any chance for an upgrade had been squashed. It is just one of those things that makes you wonder why obtaining status with a hotel chain matters. Although a better view would have been nice, when in the city, it really didn't spoil the trip. The breakfast that came with our room was outstanding. The cost is $39 per person, so if you can book a special rate with breakfast, it is well worth it. The buffet was bountiful and even had fresh honey comb available. It was so fresh, that I was half expecting to see bees flying around. The location of this hotel can't be beat. Taxi cabs are plentiful and there is a subway station directly across the street. Additionally, there are numerous shopping malls right outside the door and within several blocks. The Queen Victoria Building is a few blocks away and is a quick 5 -7 minute walk. All in all, I highly recommend this property. The rooms are large, the beds are very comfortable, the breakfast is outstanding, the location can't be beat, and there are four, free computers available to check e-mail. The only real downside is that the service was a little spotty. On several occasions, we had to call down to guest services and we had difficulty getting someone to answer the phone. We had to call back a few times until someone answered. A bit annoying, but not a deal breaker for a return trip. Also, be advised, if you need a roll away, there is a $45 charge.

At these prices, you should have unlimited access. I experienced a few technical difficulties. . .my room safe failed to work twice and it was annoying to have to keep calling for assistance. And my room key stopped working half-way through my stay - ugh. Again, for these prices, this shouldn't happen. The location is ok - it's a 15 minute walk to the harbor and there aren't a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity. I walked to Darlinghurst a few nights for a MUCH better food selection - I had some great meals there. (Try Fish Face - divine.) I'm a runner, so I mapped out a few really nice runs from the hotel - through the Botanic Garden (which is very close), along the harbor, over the bridge & back. In that respect, the location was great. If you have the funds or if someone else is footing the bill, go for it.

I am a base SPG member (previously a Gold ). It was too late in the night to complain and get a new room. The twin beds were not suitable for a 6' tall person. The room features, cleanliness and functionality were commensurate with a five star property. When I changed rooms for the 3rd through 5th night I was told that they would roll my account into the new room. While on business I like to separate accomodation charges from food and beverage for my expenses. Upon checkout I found that my room was closed out and it was not possible to separate the bill without a manual invoice. I had to leave before the day manager could whip up a manual invoice. The concierge was capable and helped me with a movie reservation. One of the low points of the hotel are the very ordinary service upon check in. No one helped with luggage on my way in or out. Not acceptable for a five star hotel. The other thing is the very dear price for food and extras. Internet is $30, two trousers and three shirts was almost $70 standard service and a charge for excersise room if you are not SPG gold or above. While the room service food was quite good, the price far excedes any of the other five star hotels I have been in Sydney; Hilton, IC and Swiss Hotel. There are better values in town. Drop downstairs on Casteleigh street and get an egg sandwich and espresso for $6!

This hotel without a doubt had the grandest entrance. The front of the hotel is very busy during the day but there is always someone available to welcome you and give u immediate service.

The patio areas have a great full of hyde park and are great for breakfast seating. There is also two computers/printers in the club room. The club room is open all day and has books and magazines for just lounging if bored. The breakfast buffet was fully stocked and well managed. Staff are attentive.

I have no problems in recommending this hotel, if you are arriving from the airport consider a cheaper option of the underground train network its about 12$AUD and takes you almost to the hotel. If you are going to catch a taxi and its off peak (late at night or very early morning) consider avoiding the toll ways they can be quick but at that time s are alternative routes that you dont need to pay for!", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wollongong", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Sheraton on the Park\u201d", "Author": "MorganWollongong", "ReviewID": "UR12271536", "Content": "Arrived to a busy reception, however all guests were quickly attended to.

The lounge also offers free wireless internet access, although reception is somewhat spotty--I think the signal is intentionally weak to prevent neighboring rooms from getting internet access for free--the hotel charges $39 a day for internet access is you're not in the lounge (although it does have free computer access in the lobby).

Decided to splash out and book an Executive suite for A$430 night, so in fact paid a total of A$860 for three nights (average A$285). We had a city view (not worth writing about) but you could pay more for a park view if you wanted to. We had Executive Lounge priviliges which basically meant breakfast on the 21st floor (not as lavish as the ground floor breakfast for everyone else, but then that was a cost of about $40pp) with the lovely harbour views, less people, etc. And great coffee. In the evening between 5-8pm you could also go to the Lounge for drinks and canapes etc, free internet use and very attentive and friendly staff. The food and drinks were more than ample to keep us going to breakfast - no problems there. Room was on the 15th floor and was very modern, stunning bathroom with black marble and very comfortable king bed - slept like a log. Plenty of space with desk and chairs. Gripes - even at $430 listed price per night, the hotel could not extend itself to provide free internet access from the room, so we limited ourselves to use it in the Lounge. They also charged for two small bottles of water from the refrigerator (There were two large bottles of water on a cabinet which clearly had a price of $8 over it so you knew those two were not complimentary. I then checked the bar price list and no mention of any charge for the two small water bottles - each only 400ml. But they apparently are not complimentary). I believe Sheraton management should start to move with what is happening in overseas Sheratons - provision of free internet (ie include in the room tariff), provide complimentary water (or at least clearly disclose a price), and also provide a clock that can take an I-Pod - many travellers take their music nowadays!!

We weren't given the option of parking the car ourselves though. Check in was quick and efficient. The room was clean and spacious. The bed was soft and very comfortable. We had a shower and bath. Despite being on the 18th floor, the view was mediocre of surrounding buildings. No balcony or open windows made it a little claustrophobic. Also, no smoking unless you request a smoking room. We visited the bride and grooms one bedroom suite. It was large with a small balcony overlooking the harbour & park. A fabulous view. A small bathroom & toilet considering it was a suite though.

There seemed to be a limit of 1 coffee or tea being made for each person The choice of food was adequate. The usual array of hot foods such as bacon, baked beans, grilled tomatoes and mushrooms, sausages, pancakes and eggs benedict which was delicious. There were 2 egg chefs making all things eggs. Yoghurts, pastries, fresh fruit, cereals and miso soup. The food was fresh & delicous but selection not as large as some other 5 star hotels.

Every employee we encountered was cheerful, helpful, and genuinely glad to be of service. When our taxi pulled up to the drive, the doorman, Tetley, welcomed us to Sydney and the hotel with beaming energy and was equally as friendly and cheerful throughout our stay. Check-in was pretty standard, but at least there was no wait, and our bags were sent to the proper rooms (we had two rooms on different floors). The Executive Club Lounge staff was superb. Cameron, Anders, and the entire Club staff were warm and helpful, eagerly calling restaurants to secure reservations and pulling up menus for various eateries. Food and drink service were good as well. Lobby Concierge Mike (I think that was his name...) recommended a great low-key, no frills Thai restaurant that served the best soft-shell crab I have EVER eaten. And I could never forget the housekeeping attendant from the 18th floor (I can't remember her name, though). Aside from keeping the room clean and bathroom amenities restocked, she was one of the nicest and friendliest hotel employees I have ever encountered. I found myself having conversations with her on a daily basis where she demonstrated a genuine care and interest in her guests that is rarely experienced. As I am about to begin my assessment of the room and facilities, I remember now a manager/supervisor in the gym and spa who took it upon herself to lead my family and me on a tour of the fitness facilities when it became evident that we were first-time visitors - she was truly lovely. The gym featured Life Fitness-brand cardio equipment with individual tv screens, as well as a few weight machines, free weights, a couple benches, and two spinning bikes. There is an indoor pool and whirlpool with breathtaking views of the park and city. Locker rooms had separate men's and women's saunas and steam rooms. All in all, a nice gym, but nothing spectacular (except with regard to the views). The rooms are comfortable and modern in style. The Sealy beds were a nice break from dormitory-quality mattresses in other Australian hotels. The down comforter was heavenly, and the sheets soft, though not 100% cotton (they are a 50/50 poly-cotton blend, which I thought I would notice but didn't once in bed). There is a desk and small sofa with a checkerboard table in each room, as well as a Philips-brand tv (27 or 30 inch, flat-screen though not flat-panel). Bathrooms are done in rich wood and black marble - beautiful. The separate shower was excellent - tremendous water pressure. Lastly there is a more than amply-sized walk-in closet in each room, which was perfect for us (traveling with huge duffel bags). My only complaint is with the soundproofing in the walls. I could hear numerous conversations from the adjacent room as well as from the hallway. To be fair, these were probably louder than normal guests, but they were still audible. This wasn't an issue for two of the four nights, but it could pose a potential problem, I guess. We didn't order room service or dine in the restaurant or bar, but the food on the club level was very good. It was nice to have a hot breakfast waiting for you every morning, and I am such a sucker for eggs, bacon, and roasted tomatoes. Afternoon canapes were primarily Asian-themed (dumplings, sushi, et al.) and good, as were cheeses and cured meats. Not a great drink selection, but they WERE pouring champagne and James Boag Premium beer (my fave). The restaurant and IRD menus were VERY pricey, but the lavish dinner buffet was half-price (or discounted in some fashion) with Starwood membership at least. In all, we truly enjoyed our stay and would love to come back were it not for the steady devaluation of the American Peso, er, Dollar. This would be our pick in Sydney without question. Fabulous. Oh, just remembered, a great amenity is the FREE internet access in the lobby for all guests.

It might have been a one off but it took a similar time to get bags the previous trip. When I asked about a late checkout they said that they didn't need the room but it would be $50 if more than an hour. Since we had a suite and were in the exec club, this was a little surprising. When my wife called later to check that we hadn't been charged twice (which we hadn't) it took her three calls to speak to someone as she was simply transferred to someone who wasnt there! All in all we might have just been unlucky on two stays. The rooms were still fine and the price competitive. If I were a tourist I think I'd look for a hotel with a great harbour view.

We stayed there again on the 11th May and had a Hyde park room which was a good size with lovely furnishings and beautifully decorated bathroom. The beds as you expect from Sheraton were very comfy and most importantly the rooms are very quite with no discernible outside noise.

Across the road is the beautiful Hyde Park and round the corner is one of the major shopping areas in the city which is no more than a two min walk. Also at the back of the hotel is access to the monorail which will take you to Darling Harbour. Also the restaurant area of Cockle Bay and King Street Wharf are only a pleasant 10 & 15 min walk respectively all of which is pretty much flat.

The opening hours also could a bit longer. The hotel has an excellent lounge on the 21st floor. The food and drink selection is far better than anything I have experienced in North America. Staff was highly attentive. But Internet and printing access in the lounge - the business center closes at 5:30 pm - were unbelievably complicated or dysfunctional. Half of all the people using the PCs needed staff support just to go online. The wireless access signal dropped off half a dozen times per hour. Printing on the available HP Laserprinters produced 1 page per minute (these printers can print 10+ pages a minute) - if it worked at all.

The check-in agent wasn't that friendly - I'm sure most of them are, but mine wasn't. I asked about an upgraded room (SPG Plat) but he said that this time of year it's near impossible - asked for a Hyde Park View room and again, no can do. Not the agent's fault and they were booked out but he just seemed a bit too quick to move on to getting me checked in and away from the counter. Once I had my room key, I made it to the 14th floor, as the agent mentioned, only to find that there was no room number on my check-in card. So back down I went to the agent and he apologized and wrote it on there. Once IN the room, I was impressed. The renovations are wonderful - there are warm brown finishes with crisp white linen, and the bathrooms are very clean and modern (see photo). Internet access was an astounding $A24.95 a day, but the connection was fast and reliable. The 'black-out' blind that can be drawn at the touch of a button are a great idea.

This is one of the better 5 star Sydney hotels I have stayed in, and will return....", "Date": "January 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuttgart, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA sad farewell to the Sheraton on the Park\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4360467", "Content": "I found it rather entertaining to read all the reviews on the Sheraton on the Park at tripadvisor.com, simply because of their disparity! I stayed in the hotel every year since 2001 for at least one week and I finally tend to agree with those, who were disappointed. I once rated this hotel as one of the best five star hotels, but year by year the dissatisfaction was growing. Rates were going up and became totally unacceptable. Don't get me wrong: It's still a good hotel with nice, spacious rooms, an elegant lobby and a proper health club. But the staff is absolutely clueless, not very well trained and simply not on the level that you would expect from a five star hotel. Service in this hotel deteriorated incredibly over the years. For example they now charge you for using the gym!?!? You wouldn't expect that in a hotel, where you're paying 400 AUD per night, wouldn't you? When you're checking in, nobody asks you, if you prefer a smoking or a non-smoking room. These are basics, well known by every front desk manager or receptionist in every Holiday Inn all over the world... When I stayed there for the last time in November 2005, I really felt cheated. I will definitely come back to Sydney, one of the most vibrant cities in the world I know. But I surely will not spend a penny at the Sheraton on the Park.", "Date": "January 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cFirst-class hotel\u201d", "Author": "JCW", "ReviewID": "UR4251882", "Content": "Great location.

Whilst the rooms are quite large and comfortable, if you get the right room, and the view across the park is lovely, especially if you can see the harbour in the distance, the service at this hotel makes the stay not worth it. I have stayed at this hotel several times when visiting Sydney for both business and pleasure (not my choice), and would not stay there again. The staff seem to run the hotel as though it is a training establishment or a factory. It was more like a place filled with uni students who were having a great time socialising with each other, but forgot the job at hand ... they're working in a hotel ... and YES ... there are customers! They demonstrate a lack of knowledge, are immature and lethargic. I will not go into spelling out the numerous examples, because they are just that ... numerous. Perhaps this is the sort of hotel that appeals to a certain crowd ... that would just look for the Sheraton name, rather than quality.", "Date": "December 15, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sheraton on the Park, Sydney", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d256637-Reviews-Sheraton_on_the_Park_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$218 - $527*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">161 Elizabeth Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2000</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "256637", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ef/0f/17/exterior.jpg"}}
