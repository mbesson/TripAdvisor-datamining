Don't stay here!\u201d", "Author": "ads102", "ReviewID": "UR25391973", "Content": "I had to stay here on business for 10 days and left feeling tired and run down. We were greeted by a dark reception with the smell of stale cigarettes, the same smell was throughout the hotel. The rooms were ok, bedding was clean and the bed was comfortable. The safe didn't have any batteries so didn't work. There is limited cable TV that includes a couple of free movie channels. The bathroom was small and dark, there is mould around the bath, and the bath had spots of rust where the enamel had been chipped off. There was something splattered on the bathroom floor, but I had no inclination to investigate further. The tablecloths at breakfast were dirty. The breakfast was not really to european tastes. I asked three times for an iron before I got one, then twice for an ironing board before giving up. There was a general noise within the room, i think from the external air conditioning units, and there are also several nightclubs in the hotel, so there is loud music throughout the hotel until 3am. I moved to a higher floor, but this made no difference. They are currently constructing a metro system right outside, so work starts on construction at 6am. The windows in the hotel (which are filthy) don't close completely, there is a gap of about 5-10mm around the window, so you can hear traffic noise from the busy 3 lane carrigeway outside. There is no wireless internet in the hotel, there is a computer in reception with internet access but this was broken for the duration of my stay. There is wifi at a cafe across the road. The hotel is in an area called Al Quasais which is a long way from any of the tourist areas. It's not possible to walk to the beach as there are not many walkways for pedestrians along the busy roads. Taxi's can be difficult to get at peak times as there is generally a lot of traffic congestion.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "AUSTRALIA", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting Hotel!!

Furtehrmore we couldnt even order room service as they knew we were from the flight so they didnt want to provide us with any service. They did not evn give us a bottle of water we got warm water at lunch and dinner where we were seperated from all paying guests into a small dining room where they cooked us a seperate meal. absolutely disgusting!!! we were not informed by the hotel when our flight would be leaving even thought they knew. We had to make an international call to our own travel agent. Dont even stay here if its free!! ure treated like a second class citizen and ud be better off sleping in the airport.

I could hear the music very clearly and phoned reception to find out (a) what time the music would stop (was told 0300) and (b) could they move me to a higher floor. They moved me to another floor, but I could still hear the music. I went down to reception and said I had a 10 hour flight the next day and had to get up at 0430 the next morning. I was told that the music would not stop before 0300 and there was nothing they could do. I even spoke to the Manager who said the same, and they could do nothing for me. What was even worse, was that there was no \"sorry\" and nothing near an apology was given to me. Basically, they couldn't care less. The nightclub had 3 people in it, but they had a hotel full of people trying to sleep. In addition they forgot my wakeup call for 0430! When I checked out I expected an apology which would have gone a long way, but again nothing was forthcoming. In summary, if you want to sleep, then don't stay here.
