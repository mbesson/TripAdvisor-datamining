The Intercambiador is one of the main arrival and departure point of long and medium distance buses that serve Spain as well as a crossing of several metro lines. The hotel is particularly useful for a quick access to the Barajas Airport, which is about 15-20 mins bus ride (bus number 200 serving all terminals, currently Euro 1.50 for single) or taxi with driving time of around 10 mins (around Euro 15-20, depending on terminal). In front of the hotel runs a very busy multiple lane road, which can be busy and noisy, however the windows manage to filter out most of the noise. The reception and the bar area is very elegant, the staff is extremely helpful and polite. The rooms are pristine clean, usually have a little entrance area that is separated from the bedroom by a door. The bedroom is beautifully decorated, quite sizeable, the bed is very comfortable and big. The minibar offers basic selection of drinks, however the TV is not a flat screen. I also used the room service and ordered food (tasty large pizza for Euro 13). The bathroom has luxury feel (in my case it also had a window) and includes a complementary shaving kit, tooth brush and paste and a comb. The air-condition was working great, but it could be a little quieter. The room seems to be well isolated from noise in the corridor and other bedrooms. I didn't opt for the breakfast in hotel which seems to be very expensive (around Euro 16). There are several little bars and cafes around where you can breakfast for less than 5 Euros. Wifi is free, but limited to 60 mins a day and is only available in the hotel lobby and bar area. Pre-paid wifi is available in rooms. I did a very last minute and emergency booking of my room (less than 2 hours before my arrival) and probably because it was the night of a very important football game in Madrid, the price was Euro 175 for what it looked like 'Executive' room!!! Checking the official website now, the price is Euro 75 for standard room, Euro 95 for 'Executive room' and Euro 165 for Suite, which I consider a great deal! I am happy to recommend this hotel as it offers great services, good prices and very useful location.", "Date": "May 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helotes, Texas", "Title": "\u201cConvenient to airport and close to metro\u201d", "Author": "anniedosamiga", "ReviewID": "UR129949354", "Content": "After a tiring flight we were delighted to put our feet up at the Abba Madrid Hotel.

The rooms are a very good size, although quite simply furnished. The bathrooms are excellent, as is the quantity of complimentary toiletries. Everything is very clean and generally in good condition. As with many of the Madrid hotels breakfast is an extra cost (16 Euros). Those who travel widely will not find the breakfast exciting, but for a Madrid hotel it is in fact OK. If you find it too expensive then there are various places outside where you will save a few Euros. I recommend trying the breakfast at the hotel on at least one day, so that you can understand whether searching around outside is really worth the hassle. As far as the cost of the hotel room is concerned, for the casual visitor make sure you search the usual internet sites rather than go directly to the hotel - this way you will find the most attractive price which makes the hotel seem like very good value. Regarding the location, it is about 25-30 minutes to make your way into the centre of town using the Metro. The hotel is also on the right side of town for the airport. WiFi access is free in the lobby and bar area, which for most people will be sufficient. The staff were all very pleasant, with some being particularly helpful.

It is on a major road so try for a rear facing room, but the views from the upper non smoking front facing are interesting and the traffic noise level is reasonable. Lots of local places to eat, with local prices compared to city centre. The hotel is well appointed, breakfast is excellent but get an inclusive deal otherwise it costs 20 euro. The staff are excellent, friendly, helpful and courteous, we had a problem with bathroom plumbing that was resolved within 20 minutes after arrival, prompt and efficient. Rooms are of a good size, beds comfortable and room service/housekeeping is very good with good quality bathroom essentials provided and quality towelling. We wonder sometimes what other reviewers expect, we travel a lot, we are discerning and this hotel ticks most of the boxes for a capital city for about100 euros a night with breakfast.

Hotel rooms were fairly plain but reasonably spacious and comfortable and included a TV, minibar and a safe. Bathroom was above average with a good assortment of complimentary items plus a decent sized bathtub. The room service menu is quite limited though and delivery was not especially speedy. I found the restaurant menu also to be rather limited and only dined in once. Not a problem from my perspective though as there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Breakfast on the other hand was excellent - one of the best I've come across in a European hotel. Fresh fruit and juices and plenty of bakery items and hot and cold dishes to choose from.

It's not ideal for tourists, but not too bad if you ride the very efficient and inexpensive Metro. The hotel is about 100 yards/meters from the Cartegena Line 7 Metro stop and a 20 minute Metro ride to the center, although you'll need to change at either the Avenida Americas or Canal station. Buy a ten-trip ticket for 9 euros; you can hand it to a companion so he/she can use it with you to go throgh the turnstile. The standard rooms are large enough, with a king or 2 twin beds and a desk. There's WiFi in the room available for 10 euros for 24 hours, which is not unreasonable. WifFi also works in the lobby. But it would be nicer if it was free. The room furnishing is a step above basic but not luxurious. The room I had on the 11th floor cost 115 euros in May 2010 including breakfast and taxes. (That was a group rate) The rom was quiet and the bathroom was modern, clean and functional. The only thing missing was a box of Kleenex. The included breakfast is complete -- egs, fruit, cheese, meat & cereal choices. It was struggle to get a cup of coffee from the freiendly but busy wait staff and the distinctly less friendly manager didn't seem think it was his duty to get you anything at all. I didn't have lunch or dinner in the restaurant, but there was a good if slightly expensive bar menu and the service was fast, friendly and accomodating. The staff at the front desk were helpful.
