Breakfast was excellent, a choice of continental and bacon & eggs,fresh fruit, cereals, fresh squeezed fruit juices and all types of coffees. Location, I agree it is not central, but if you done some research you would know that so why moan about it, for 9 euro you are in the heart of Barcelona, it would cost you more than that for a similar ride in London or Edinburgh.

Pretty good value. The rooms were modern and well appointed with effective air-con and the staff, who speak excellent English, were friendly and helpful. Buffet breakfast, while of good quality, was pretty steep at \u20ac14 per person. The main thing about this hotel is that it is quite far out of town and, although the bus service is pretty good, the most frequent bus (No. 22) takes a good 30 minutes to get into the centre, while the nearest metro station a 20 minute walk away. One advantage is that Barcelona Bus Turistic, which brings you to all the major tourist attractions, stops at the nearby Monastir de Pedralbes. Taxi fare to the city-centre is about \u20ac8-11, depending on traffic. As noted in a previous review, however, the distance from the city-centre does mean that the hotel has nice views of the mountains. There's also a decent shopping centre on the Avinguda Diagonal near the metro station. Overall, we found the Sansi Pedralbes to be a decent base if a little too far from the city-centre; going back there every evening before heading back in to town for dinner, clubbing etc. was an hour-long round trip. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Barcelona, and we will be back.", "Date": "July 26, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sansi Pedralbes", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d236195-Reviews-Sansi_Pedralbes-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$119 - $303*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Av.
