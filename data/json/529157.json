It can be though to walk your luggage during carnival.. Its location is obviously excellent only 5 minutes walk to St. Marco's square. The room was of average size, with medium-comoftable bed. However, we asked to move to another room and the staff nicely changed our rooms to a better one. The wifi is not free. The breakfast is average. During carnival the hotel's price was quite expensive, but considering the location it is good. I would recommend to stay on the island, since the city is jam packed and you can easily walk to the square where everything is happening.

Rooms are cozy, spacious and clean. We did not miss anything. One serious problem i found was the isolation of the rooms: you could easily hear everything through the walls and doors. So, if you have noisy neighbours (which we had the second night), you could easily follow their discussions.

We arrived by train and took a water taxi to the San Zaccaria boat stop. Booking a water taxi online is about the same price as paying at the train station the difference being that a pre-paid water taxi is tough to find as they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go out of their way to identify themselves. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to negotiate the public water transport after first arriving in Venice. It was about 70 euros for the water taxi. Using the directions from the website we found the hotel fairly easily. It helped that we looked at the exterior photos of the hotel before going to Venice as it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to walk by the front entrance. The hotel is in a really convenient location. Located about 3-4 blocks from Piazza San Marco, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s about a 5 minute walk to the square. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located on a small square with residences and a small church. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within a few minutes of the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small hotel with something like 12 or 15 rooms.

Located on the 3rd \u00c2\u00bd floor the room was composed of two adjoining hotel rooms. The TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are tiny and there are only 5 channels (one is CNN). The quad is at the back of the hotel over a small canal and a neighboring hotel. The air conditioning was excellent and kept the room very cool on the hot late June days. There was a bathroom in each room. One included only a tub and the other only a shower. Our rooms were on the top floor and down the hall from the breakfast area. So in the morning it could get a little noisy when people arrived for breakfast. We placed hand towels at the bottom of the door and this help cut down on the early morning noise. The breakfast consisted of some cereals, breads, juice and coffee. It was enough to give you something to fill tummies before heading out. They also provided us with electronic mosquito repellent devices. We used them the first two days but found that with the windows shut there were no issues with bugs or pests. The beds were comfortable. Housekeeping kept the room very clean. Afternoon attendant (from Croatia) was very helpful in helping us understand the area and steer us in the right direction.

There were quite a few nearby. The rooms were bigger than I expected and very clean. They are simple but it was perfect for what we wanted. It felt like a true \"Venetian\" experience. We were able to sit on the window sill and look right out into the waterway. One word of caution, there's no AC, so you may keep the window open to stay cool. Not a problem, but good to know in advance. I did get bit by a few mosquitoes because we had the window open all night, a bug coil or something would've have helped and I think they actually have them we just didn't ask.

Stayed for three days in La Locandiera in Venice for a romance/relaxing trip. As everything is expensive in Venice, this hotel turned out to be a real nice choice for the normal price. It is very simple to find (contrarily to some other opinions - I guess some people are used only to perpendicular streets) - just follow the excellent hotel map from the ferry stop San Zaccaria at San Marco. Pros: 1. Location, location, location. In the very centre, but unbelievingly quiet. Our room faced a small square (Campo San Giovanni Nuovo) to the south near the (former?) church, and other rooms face the canal. Either way you can sleep well. Also, in Venice you will walk a lot (even with ferry hopping), so getting quickly back to hotel from anywhere during the day or after a good dinner is always appreciated. 2. Helpful staff. Always there (24h), all speaking Italian/good English (+other), willing to chat and to give useful information. It was possible to reschedule our trip for a few days just before the arrival without any financial consequences. Indeed they offer a free (one-way!) tour to Murano, and it is also possible to make agreements for the gondola trip (yes, *expensive*, but if you are on a romance trip...just do it and forget the ticking Euros :-). 3. Simple but nice self-serving breakfast. I guess the majority of the hotels offer quite the same regarding the other reviews. The breakfast room on the ground floor is nice and has windows on the canal. 4. Lift. Not many hotels in this price range offer this. 5. Very nice, big and clean bathroom, no leaking or damaged walls. Cons: 1. Have to think hard to find any...maybe just if some other guests would occupy the room just opposite our door, we could hear their doors opening and banging in our room as there are no additional doors inside the room, but I suppose this is normal in all hotels.

The rooms were very clean, the only negative point would be that there wasn't a mirror in one of the bedrooms (but that could easily be added) and all our children used the shower in our bathroom as they had a bath in theirs! Would definitely recommend this Hotel, in fact we are considering booking it for my parents wedding anniversary. Another plus point for this Hotel is the free trip to Murano Island to visit the glass factory. We went on a private boat which we all thoroughly enjoyed! The glass factory was well worth visiting and then we looked aroung the Island which was very enjoyable. Thoroughly enjoyed our break in Venice, although very expensive to eat out.

The hotel is located in a very quiet area in Venice but it is very close to everything at the same time! About 5-10 minutes walk to San Marco's square (depending on how quick you walk) and the Rialto bridge is a walking distance too. About the hotel, the reception staff were very helpful and spoke very good English especially the manager, Marina and Laura was nice and sent us an email confirming our booking as soon as we booked the room and most importantly gave us the best map of Venice and showed us exactly where to go for tours and how to come back to the hotel on the map. The breakfast was continental but very nice, providing cheese,butter, different types of jam, tinned peaches, cereal, meusli, peach and orange juice, yoghurts, croissants, bread rolls and tea and coffee. One day they provided pie too. Our room was clean and spacious and it overlooked a very small stream or canal and it was very quiet. The TV was small and all the channels were Italian but it was no big deal as we came back late every night and we were too tired to watch TV. There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room but we asked for tea one night and the chap at reception prepared it for us free of charge. We booked for 3 tours from the hotel: the original walking tour, it was very nice where they showed us the important places in the city including St Marco, Rialto, Santa Maria Formosa, ....etc. but it is 2 hours and most of the time we were standing so you will need very good shoes and a good night's sleep too. The 2nd tour was the boat trip, where we were taken by a water taxi around the grand canal and they showed us the history behind some of the buildings and it was very nice too, different from the walking tour so I would recommend both. The 3rd tour was the Ghost walk in the evening that starts from the Rialto, it was nice and they took us to hidden places in the alleys (calle) and talked about people who died and stories about them. These were all booked from the hotel where they have brouchure's and you can choose any tour you want but alternatively you can go yourself to the starting point and book them yourself. They booked the trip to Murano for us and we went for that one again but because I read the previous reviews I knew exactly what to expect: They collected us from the hotel and took us there by water taxi and showed us the glass factory and it was very interesting to watch but afterwards we walked through the gallery or the display area and we enjoyed looking around. However, everything was very expensive and overpriced and when you finish walking around they lead you to the exit door and that's it! the trip is free GOING there but you have to go back on your own. If you wanted to take the Vaparotti back to San Marco when you go out of the exit TURN RIGHT and there is a vaparotti stop around the corner but if you want to look around in Murano there is a nice glass sculpture if you turn left and walk around the river or canal and small glass shops but we didn't buy anything because it was all quite expensive and we were advised to buy from Burano which we didn't have the time to go to! Maybe in our next visit. We bought 2 day tickets for the vaparotti (water bus) as recommended by others but there was something we noticed that no one mentioned before: although we had the tickets no one ever asked us for them! People seemed to go on the boats for free! Don't take my word for it but I am telling you nobody ever asked us for tickets neither there were any machines to check if they were valid! However, when we were going back from St Zaccaria stop we saw a woman asking people to show tickets and that was the only time it happened in the 3rd day of our stay. The trip to and from the airport was different, they asked for the tickets before you entered and half-way through which was 12 euros pp but it is a good hour to and from venice. If you are staying in Venice and you like the beach take a trip to Lido where they have nice beaches which are sandy. We didn't have any problems comminicating because it is a touristy area and most of the locals spoke English. I forgot to mention the gondola, you have to go on a gondola if you are in Venice!

If I was asked advice in the future, I'd recommend people stay out of San Marco as whilst its convenient around the main square, you'll pay double the price in any restaurant than if you head up from Rialto a bit", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "LondonScott", "ReviewID": "UR14502742", "Content": "this hotel was really great in terms of location.

We took the Alilaguna water bus directly from the airport, which took 1 hr 10 mins to the San Zaccharia stop (around 12 euros per person each way; young children free). The hotel was easy to find when we followed the directions provided by the hotel (looking at street names rather than pictorially; around 5 minutes walk from San Zaccharia water bus station). It is located in a small, quiet square close to St Marks (2 minute walk), so although there are plenty of bars and restaurants close by, we had no problems with noise. The hotel itself is very clean, the room was very spacious (we had a large double bed, a single bed plus a cot in our room and there was still plenty of floor space). We booked a Family room, and just assumed it would include a bath - it didn't ( the shower cubicle was great though). So our toddler went unwashed for 3 days! As previous reviewers commented, the Breakfast is continental style with fresh croissants, bread, jams, boiled eggs, cereal, yogurts, tinned fruit, cheese, tea, coffee and juices. It was much better than we expected, and we all enjoyed waking up to the smell of freshly baked bread every day! One morning we went for a late breakfast, around 9.40am (breakfast was 8.00am-10.00am), and were disappointed to find all the eggs had gone and there was very little coffee left. On our final morning, however, the staff had arranged the breakfast early so we could eat before our departure. So that more than made up for the previous day! Staff are friendly and helpful.

Initially it was a little difficult to find as the map I obtained from the website I booked through did not accurately reflect the walkways and alleyways I had in front of me. If I recall correctly ... from the Grand Canal walk up Calle degli Albanesi or Calle delle Rasse - the latter was busier and wider (I think) then up Calle de Chiesa - first left after the square with restaurants and shops, just passed a pizza take away place - if you read the bridge across a waterway you have gone too far. The hotel is located on a very quiet square - there are some people walking through but few and far between as the square which the hotels stands on seems like a dead end - however, we found a little used back route from an alleyway in the square to St Marks which is less than 5 mins away - it is very difficult to describe how to get to places in Venice, but I would take good walking shoes and explore - I was with my mother and never felt threatend wherever we wondered after dark. I requested two single beds and we were allocated a room on the top floor (there is a small lift but not both of you and your luggage can squueze in) overlooking the square (no 5?)- yes not a room with a view but it was so peaceful and I know that noise is a common compliant in such a crowded city - it was large in comparison to other Enuropean cities we have stayed in with a double and a single bed - with plenty of room to walk around - a wardrobe, set of drawers, chair, small room safe - small haridryer, TV with only rolling news channels in ENlgish (but you have the most beautiful city on your doorstep) - there was a door into the room - with a very small area and a door to the good sized bathroom with shower and then another door to the sleeping area - this double door arrangement meant that I was never aware of noise from other guests. Breakfast on two mornings was served from the top floor - not the best breakfast in the world, dried foods, cerals and so on - but was good enough and set you up for the day. This hotel may not have a lot of mod cons, but it makes up for this in good value (in Venice), so clean / immaculate, location (close to St Marks, Waterbus stops, good value / good standard restaurants by Venice standards) and service from the wonderful friendly, helpful staff.

When we go back to Venice we WILL stay here again.", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts, England", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Locandiera\u201d", "Author": "Mulherin", "ReviewID": "UR6610867", "Content": "Having just left the appalling Hotel Marconi after one night, we arrived at the Locandiera wondering why we had come to Venice. It did not take long for our spirits to rise with the help of the wonderful staff . Nothing was too much trouble. Great quiet location - but only a short walk to main sights. Spacious and light rooms. We would definitely stay there again.
