Venice was our first stop in Italy after driving down from Munich. We drove down and used GPS to be able to find this place. We arrived late in the evening and had a little bit of trouble finding the place cause it was hidden behind another building on the main street. We almost drove away till I saw the sign for the hotel and decided to walk down a small narrow street and confirmed that the hotel was indeed back there. Had my brother park in their parking lot and then we all went inside to check in. The exterior of the hotel looks like something from the 70s and it is not close to any train station so heading into town is not easy. We drove over the bridge and parked at one of the parking structures on the island. Entering the lobby, there is a feel of a luxurious hotel out of the 80s, luckily without the 80s colors. Lots of black through. The check-in process was easy and we got our keys to separate rooms. My buddy and I shared a double room with 2 full size beds. The room was just large enough to fit both beds and a large dresser with a TV. The bathroom was also just large enough. Everything about the room seemed to be simple but elegant. Nothing overdone, but nothing cheap looking. The beds, pillows, linens, and towels were all comfy and clean. For the price, we enjoyed our stay although as my sister-in-law pointed out, the neighborhood looked like some rundown places back home. Next time we'll see if we can make advanced reservations for a place on the island.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens Greece", "Title": "\u201cVery average and boring hotel\u201d", "Author": "ALMI64", "ReviewID": "UR123933535", "Content": "It is not in Venice but in Mestre. rooms are tiny, service is indifferent and it is not really a place to offer you a memorable experience.

The rooms were large and updated. The bathrooms were a nice size with a separate tub. The beds were comfortable and the linens nice. Beds were two twins together. The staff is very helpful and speak very good English. The lobby is spacious and the bar is very nice. The bartender was wonderful and even ordered a take out pizza for one of the couples that was not feeling well. He delivered it himself and brought them a beer as well! The hotel is located in Mestre, outside of Florence. We purchased a two day bus pass and a two day water taxi pass. The bus stop is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. It takes about 15 minutes to get to the water taxi station. Depending on where you are going from there, you could wait up to 20 minutes for the public water taxi. The hotel is located near restaurants and shopping on a main street. The breakfast choices were extensive and very good. The only drawback to this hotel is the a/c. We happened to be there during a very hot spell, over 90 F every day. We could not get the rooms cooled down. It made it uncomfortable to sleep. The hotel was very apologetic but it appears that the system is too small to cool the rooms when it is very hot. The hotel mgr stated they would be replacing the a/c system this winter. The hotel staff arranged a free land taxi to a private water taxi that took us to Murano Island at no cost to us. I believe there is some sort of agreement with the shops encouraging you to purchase crystal there. Either way, it was nice. You do have to pay to get back to Venice. We also went to Burano which has lace and was very colorful.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Khalkis, Greece", "Title": "\u201cone of the best hotels I have stayed in\u201d", "Author": "mariamusic", "ReviewID": "UR83736654", "Content": "I think we were very lucky that we chose to stay there for our trip to Venice.

Bus stop for bus to Venice (10 minute trip) is 2 minutes walk from the hotel. Would recommend purchasing a 12 hour (16 euros) or 24 hour (18? euros) bus/boat pass from reception at the hotel. It is good for the bus to Venice as well as the water bus all around Venice. Room was very clean, bed was comfortable, AC worked well, bathroom had shower only, free secure parking on the premises.. Shopping center, local restaurants, and a movie theater all within 10 minutes walking distance. We were able to catch a movie (The Town) at the theater in Mestre that was part of the Venice International Film Festival that was ongoing while we were there. A very good breakfast was served from 7 until 11 each morning. One female waitress was very friendly and welcoming, but the other was very grumpy and could use some training in the area of customer service. All other staff (reception and cleaners) were friendly and helpful. Free high speed internet would have made our stay perfect, but it cost 5 euros/hour or 12.90 euros/24 hours.

It was our luck then to get a 4 star hotel at half price for the night! It was a very modern hotel with a bath and was a very quiet room- double glazed windows. Don't let the busy road nearby scare you- we heard nothing! The breakfast was typical, however, we found the croissants were freshly baked. (We were becoming experts on breakfast by now!)

This is a typical older italian hotel. The property is conveniently located about 12-15 minutes by bus to Venice. The hotel location is close the the Mestre town squre which provides nice walking and eating opportunities. There is no gym or room service (contrary to what they say.) The breakfast is adequate. The rooms are nicely decorated but small. I am not a smoker and was given a smoking room as it was the only one available. Normally cigarette smoke doesn't bother my but it somehow got in the room (through the heat ducts?) and was quite obnoxious. We moved to the Marriot Courtyard by the Venice Airport and for the same money got a much nicer new hotel with gym with excellent food and service.
