The hotel is placed in a nice area, all attractions are within walking distance (except for the Vatican). Even Termini station is within walking distance. We didn't use public transportation at all. The hotel is lovely, it has clean and well kept rooms, a bit small however. I would have liked a more spacious room. Also, the breakfast they serve is very good. Unfortunately, the staff wasn't as nice as we expected. They seemed very money hungry and made no effort to hide that and be polite. We had to ask for the wireless password two times before they actually gave us the correct one and they didn't bother to apologize. The they before we left, they told us Rome will be messed up by an organized protest and we won't be able to get to the airport unless we ask them to call a special taxi for us. The taxi had a 40 euros fee and we would also have to pay the hotel butler for carrying our bags (3 euros) and of course, there was a \"caller tax\" of 5 euros. We kindly declined the offer and the next day we took a bus to the airport for 12 euros each. No signs of riots or protest whatsoever. We had our vacation pre paid. However, at checkout, they asked us to pay again because they were not able to get the money from the agency we booked with. We showed a printed confirmation which stated everything was paid, yet they insisted. We insisted as well and finally in our presence they made another try to get the money from the agency's account and it instantly worked. Again, no apologies. All in all we had a great time, but in spite of nice rooms and good restaurant, I wouldn't chose this hotel again. The people who work there need to be more careful with their guests.

We probably would not have \"found\" this Hotel but for this booking prompt on Celebrity Cruise's package page. We so appreciate the introduction! The Empire Palace is on Via Aureliana. It is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels group. Via Aureliana is in a very safe and lovely business district just east of the Trevi Fountain and adjacent to the Borghese Gardens. Our room was very clean and comfortably outfitted: very comfortable bed, to-die for sheets, well equipped bathroom, comfy robes, extra blankets. Housekeeping was terrific - always replacing and keeping us fully stocked on towels, soaps, etc. There was evening turn down service: chocolates and bedside linen foot mats placed out each night. Our package included daily breakfast in the Hotel's dining room. It was a buffet but very delicious with high quality offerings. Even the milk for our coffee arrived heated in little creamers. The Hotel is in a refurbished \"palace\" so has some interesting architectural features. There is a charming bar (inside and outside interior courtyard seating). Drinks were high quality and not any more expensive than what we pay state-side. Additionally, they were always accompanied by tasty appetizers at no further charge! There are a number of very, very good small restaurants within a very safe walking distance of the Hotel. La Lampada Restaurant, just around the corner from the Empire Palace, is particularly delicious. These were all casual places with decent prices (@ 10 to 12 Euros for a pasta course; good bottle of local red wine @ 16 Euros - dinner with appetizer, pasta main course and wine ran around 50 Euros for us). The Hotel staff were friendly and helpful and many spoke English. Our hotel rate was a fantastic $700 USD for all three nights. The only negative and it really is a faint negative was the size of our room. It was a tad cramped. But we were on a corner so it was open and airy. The room next to ours was a lovely two room suite so there are larger rooms available. There are also smaller rooms available as a single bed - very convent/dorm size but appeared totally adequate and comfortable. We were on the front corner of the Hotel on the second floor and there was some street noise in the early evening and early morning. It did not bother us, however. Taxi rate to the Vatican was $15 Euros. You could easily walk to the Trevi Fountain and to Via Piave where there are a number of interesting shops and stores. We would return to the Empire Palace - cruise or not - on our next trip to Rome. It was clean, safe and lovely.

The bathroom features good quality toiletries and in our case, bathrobes. We were upgraded to a junior suite so we also had a whirlpool tub and and extra dressing area/sitting area which was more than adequate for anyone planning an extended stay ( we were there 6 nights). The A/C worked well on what were very hot Roman Days ( typically about 90 and sunny in the first week of September 2011). Breakfast includes bacon, eggs, cheeses, fruits, breads and pastries an assortment of juices and whatever coffee/tea you like.

The front desk manager Silvano and his staff were very helpful and were nice to chat with they seemed to know about anything we asked and were correct in the information they supplied. Finally, there are by my count 6 restaurants and an Enoteca within a block or two of the hotel. Despite the quiet location off Via XX September these were plenty of good options particularly if you didn't want to go out too far after a heavy day of touring. We tried 3 of those restaurants ( out of a total of 6 nights to show you what we thought of them) and had very good meals at all of them. We also stopped for a glass of wine late one night on the way back to the hotel and found that Enoteca to be very knowledgeable about wine choices as well as having a good selection of salumis etc in case you wanted to just have dinner there.

So to be fair, I must look at this establishment as a 120 Euros a night hotel. From that standpoint, it is only a 10-15 minute walk from the nearest metro station. There is not much going on in this area of Rome, but if you can get to a metro station, you can go some place else more happening. I even managed to walk to Roma Termini without much difficulty (except for trying to dodge traffic that seems to come at me with a vengeance). It is quiet, it is tucked away from the main crossroads. It has a restaurant that serves more than adequate dinner items. The dinner waitstaff is quite obliging. On the other hand, the room is small, the furniture worn out and dated, the ceiling paint peeling off in big pieces. The breakfast room can also get overcrowded in the morning, and the waitresses often are absent minded (one morning a waitress kept insisting giving me coffee instead of tea; and on another morning, another waitress cleared the table completely for the next guest while I was waiting in the buffet line). Depending on the time of day, the reception desk can be staffed with folks that either were curt (but delivers the information you were asking for), or great to work with. Cris in particular was very helpful. By the way, do not ask the front desk to break bills down, they always claim they do not have enough change (they don't even have change to break a 10 Euro bill down). This is not the Spanish steps, this is not the Roman colisseum. The neighborhood definitely doesn't compare to the more fancy ones in town, with the shopping and the dining. However, if the hotel price is right, and you are looking for a clean room with a decent bed, then one can always find the Roman Experience a subway ride away from the hotel.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel in a good location\u201d", "Author": "Dizzy79", "ReviewID": "UR115147449", "Content": "In a quiet yet central location, 10 minutes walk up the hill from Piazza Barberini, and about 10 minutes walk from Termini station.

The room was fairly spacious, we got a bottle of Rose Prosecco and fresh fruit as a welcome. Very nice touch. Bed was fine, and so were the furnishings. The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic. My wife and I are ardent walkers, so for us, there was no need to take a taxi anywhere as all the sights in Rome were walkable for us, including the Vatican. Breakfast is good, but not spectacular, and the bar has fair prices by Roman standards. The employee who checked us in was very friendly, and the doorman assisted my wife without having to be prompted. The hotel is also nice and quiet, so getting good sleep is easy. The minor issues are that the helpfulness and friendliness of employees hinges greatly on the individual employees. Some were terrific others were not very helpful and at times slightly stand-offish. Maybe the greatest issue we had was that the bathroom has a significant amount of mold around the caulking of the bathtub, and the front panel of the bathtub was so loose that it fell off on a couple of occasions when I accidentally touched it with the used towels on the floor.

It may not be a traditional \u201cromantic\u201d hotel (as one of the reviewers below mention, it is more of a business hotel), but it worked really well for us. The location is not central \u2013 and we certainly did a lot of walking during our time in Rome \u2013 but it is quiet. We had a courtyard room, so no traffic noise whatsoever, and the neighbourhood itself (between the US and UK embassies) seemed very calm and safe. There was not the constant traffic as seen in some of the more hotel-dense locations. The included breakfast became something we looked forward to each morning, and was perfect for stocking up before all that walking. There was an enormous selection: fresh fruit, pastries, cereal, bacon and eggs, toast, cold cuts, rolls . . . I could go on. Fresh fruit juice, as well as tea and coffee, were also on offer. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and spoke excellent English. The rooms were always cleaned to a high standard when we were out during the day \u2013 including chocolates on the pillow. The room itself was very nice. Described as a \u201cjunior suite\u201d at the front desk, it consisted of a small anteroom with wardrobe, desk and TV, then a larger bedroom (also with TV) and a decent-sized bathroom. An expected bonus was that the bathtub was also a Jacuzzi (with six jets), and it was wonderful to soak in the evenings after all the walking. Robes and slippers were also provided. I feel a bit picky discussing the negatives, but here it goes . . . the number of light switches in the room was a bit overwhelming for a small space. I think there were at least 12 switches, not all in the room they worked with, e.g. one bathroom light had to be turned on in the bathroom, the other was located in the bedroom. After ten days there we certainly had a fair idea of what was what, but for the first few it was a matter of trial and error. It was rather cold when we were in Rome, and it was nice to see that they had extra blankets in the wardrobe. However, when used, the blankets \u201cshed\u201d horribly.

It is not a tourist hotel, mostly business people so it's pretty quiet inside and no one bothers you. The bed was comfortable and I really liked the quality of the bathroom toiletries provided. Nice shower/tub. Minifridge also but we might have been upgraded. You have to insert your key into a slot in the room to turn the room on otherwise the lights won't function. This way when you leave you have to take your key and can't waste power. Pretty neat! Since it is not tourist-y it is not as close to the Colisseum, Trevi Fountain, or the Spanish steps. It is walkable but from other accounts it would be a decent 20-30 minute walk. We walked about 10-15 minutes to the Metro station and used that to get around. For 1 euro it was worth it. From the hotel's description we felt the Metro was a little further than described. We used it to to get to Vatican City (a stop past the Spanish Steps) and the Coliseum and it was easy. We felt safe and there is good signage. We walked from the hotel to Piazza Barberini and Via Veneto and saw the Capuchin Crypt (1 euro donation, for entry, pretty creepy and cool BTW) On the same square block as the hotel and on the side streets are several great little restaurants and a wine shop.

The room was on the smallish side for my liking as you just had enough room to walk around the bed and not much more. The bathroom was smallish as well and I did find the shower cabinet very tight. But then again the buiding has been converted so they just made the best use of what space they had. They charged you 19 euros for your internet connection for 24hrs and for that it also gave you all the TV and Film channels as well. We loved this hotel for the closeness to all the sites of Rome plus the ease of access to the cafes and bars. Breakfast was well stocked with both hot and cold dishes. There was no parking at the hotel but they arranged under ground secure parking near by for 25 euros a day. We used Varstours as recommended by the hotel as they were based just around the corner, their service could be a bit of hit or a miss depending on guide but they did get you past all the large queues. A few good cafes around the hotel but we found one just right and right once you step out of the front door very good pizza and snacks at a very good price plus he does like a good chat very entertaining.

We paid 60 euro for a small lasagna, a beef steak, some chips and water!!!) You will get nicer food at a more reasonable price if you walk into the main tourist area of Rome. I would also add, if you book any of the trips as we did, Rome in a day, be prepared that this trip involves HOURS of non stop walking. Although you see some fantastic sights (Vatican, Sistine Chapel etc) I would not recommend this trip to anyone with any problems walking as there are VERY FEW opportunities to rest.

We didn't get to a few things that we could have gone to by metro or bus as we preferred to walk everywhere our first time in Rome, but that would have been easy to do from that location. And, it was near a lot of good stuff and some good restaurants. Plus, quiet for sleeping. The rooms were big for a EU hotel, beds quite comfy. Except the pillows could be better, they are a little hard but not terrible. The rooms were spotless and the service was superb. Fairly big bathroom, typical EU shower with a small glass door on a bath, but functioned quite well and mostly the bathroom didn't get wet. Shower pressure was great and the soap and products provided were great, also with a heated towel bar and two comfy robes and slippers. Internet wasn't too bad, have had worse and had both cable and some wifi in the room. Breakfast came with the room rate so the value was really good as it was a huge buffet with excellent food. We ended up eating a really big breakfast and then only drinking water during the day, maybe a really small snack and going for an early dinner (that's not so easy in Rome) but pizzerias always open and since it's very close to Piazza Barberini there are tons of restaurants open early there (not only pizzerias). Had some excellent food there and also on Via de Piave. Our furthest walk was to the Vatican, 2 miles to the museum entrance. Colosseum was only about 1.5 miles, maybe a little less. We walked everywhere, lucked out with really good weather, even when the forecast said rain, it rarely even sprinkled. Hotel staff was very helpful and nice, suggested dinners. Also we thought we may have to stay an extra day due to weather in the US but didn't but they said no problem. Didn't look at the exercise room, I suspect not much in there, we just walked a LOT instead of working out. So location, maybe could be better, but next time I'd probably use the metro since I now know my way around, and in that case, you couldn't do much better, since it was near Termini so you could catch both lines there. Only watch out for the little (or not so little) gifts left by walking dogs. The sidewalks in the neighborhood don't seem to inspire people to clean after their pooches.

We did walk back from the Colosseum one evening, however, that took about 35-45 minutes. Quite doable if you enjoy walking, but a bit tiring if you've already spent the day sightseeing. (I'd suggest the metro for getting to the attractions - Colosseum, Vatican etc). The room we had was spacious enough, with about 3 feet of room between the foot of the bed, and the desk/TV. It had the amenities you would expect for a higher end hotel (but I have to admit we didn't use too many of them). As other reviews have stated - breakfast was good. Eggs, Sausage, pastries, juices, fruits. (some canned, some fresh) The room was clean and the almost all marble bathroom was warm and cosy with enough space (ie. functionally small, but not cramped). Since it was winter, the heated towel racks were nice (and also a useful place to quick dry some hand-washed laundry). The staff were very helpful, considerate, and had better english language skills than some other hotels we stayed at during our trip.

The included breakfast was of good quality and variety, but not fantastic, as I have read in some of the other reviews. (Don't get me wrong though, nothing wrong with it and it was good.) The biggest sleeper in the hotel was the Aureliana Restaurant. We ate 3 dinners at the hotel and ALL of them were PERFECT. Superior Risotto, fillet mignon, and lamb. The wines are not overpriced and are of good variety. The staff was SUPERB! There is quite a difference in service and attentiveness between the morning and evening staff.

We stayed at 4-5 star hotels in venice, florence, tuscany and positano and this hotel was way below all of the hotels we stayed at. We were very disappointed. From the pictures on the website it looks very nice, trendy even. The empire palace hotel falls short of what it looks like it promises in every way. The lobby looks like its trying very hard to be nice, but its just not. The walls look like my little cousin finger painted them. The room is TINY...Now I live in NYC so I know small but this was really tiny. Just a bed and no room for luggage. The blanket was really ratty looking and I got grossed out even thinking about putting my body on the bed. The sheets were so stiff it hurt to put my face on the pillow. The bathroom was miniature! The shower was not even a shower stall and one wouldn't believe how small it is unless they saw it. One person could barely fit into the shower and I was joking with my husband. i said what would an overweight person do if they had to shower here? I truly expected much more since my travel agent booked me here and I did investigating on my own. The website looked great and the reviews were good but this hotel really fell short. As far as the LOCATION...my biggest problem really since we weren't in the hotel too much(thank goodness). It really felt desolate and I would be afraid to walk outside there at night. We had to take cabs everywhere which was horrible. We would have liked to stay somewhere in a better location and we would have paid more if it meant being in the center or at least near the action.

I am a Travel Agent and I do get to stay in a lot of Hotels so hopefully I can compare with others in my experience. Whilst I believe the Hotel is not quite up to the 4* plus it portrays in its web site, nevertheless I would give it a well derserved 3*+ catagory. Location is in a very good safe area of Rome, approx 8-10 minutes walk to the Presidents Palace and a further 5-10 mins to the Forum etc. Very good breakfast both continental and American style. Sorry didn't use the metro whilst i believe its very good, a lot of pickpockets on the trains. Watch out around Trevi fountain and major sites as crowds do attract these undesirable people. Rooms were very clean and well provided for with flat screen TV with internet access 5 Euro for 1 hour, good quality bathrooms etc. Some of the rooms can be small but most city centre properties I have found especially in older buildings are never large. Restaurant was very good with a la carte and set course menus, courtyard bar with accompanied piano music on an evening. Very welcome frosted glasses for the very cold beer after walking all over this great city. Good welcome from the reception staff and very helpful when called upon. - reconfirming taxi collection etc. can also recommend Romeshuttlelimousine.com for an excellant transfer 35 Euros from Fiumincino Airport., big Alfa outbound and Mercedes inbound, cheaper than metered taxi's. Did the open top bus tour, use it as a cheap way of getting around the city, 20 Euros for a 2 days ticket with headsets for the info, however as a tour not the best one I have been on. Best advice - pre-book a tour to get into the Vatican Museum and Coliseum as the queues are quite horrendous and all groups have priority at these sites.

The location is very good. Although some reviewers have complained about the distance to metro, it is only a 10 minutes walk. Furthermore, several bus stops are right outside the hotel. Line 64 can take you to many places directly, and if you insist on taking the metro, either Line 64 or Line 36 will make stop at Republic metro station. It is important to remember the metro system in Rome is quite poor compare to other large cities like Paris or Shanghai. There are several fairly good places to eat around the hotel, and the resturant in hotel is very good and reasonable as well. Lunch including primo and secondi is only 22 euros without any other charge and a bottle of S. Pellegrino is free. The breakfast is also very good. A nice greek takeout place is just around corner and it has the best kebab I have ever had. It would appear the hotel is located within the Italian goverment district, and most of the places around the hotel usually only serve local. Compare to other districts in Rome, this one is very clean and quite with some nice small up-scale shops just around corner. We booked through expedia, and the room rate is very reasonable. The room itself is actually fairly large, about the same size as the room you would find in a European Hilton. The bath room is on the small side with only shower and no bath, but the bath room does have a very nice marble finish. In addition, the hotel uses ETRO soaps and shampoos, which is quite unusual and nice since ETRO is a fairly pricey name brand.
