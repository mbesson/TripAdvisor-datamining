The Santa Grand has clean rooms with adequate space, a comfortable bed, and very good shower. The air-conditioning is efficient, without being aggressively cold. The reception staff are very helpful and obliging.

The hotel room was ok but the bathroom was very dated. The location was ok but not great - about a 10 min walk to the MRT station. It did have a good working air conditioner. Before arriving we paid a deposit of the cost of the first night's accommodation. Check-in was fine and we were given our room key. The staff didn't know anything about the area. There was an ipad attached the wall in the reception area which we used ourselves to work out our way around. Our biggest shock and disappointment with the hotel came when we arrived back at the room after a long day of sightseeing at about 11pm on the second night of our stay. After such a full day, we (and our two young children) were rather hot and tired so before going up to the room we bought a bottle of water from the reception desk. Nothing was said to us and we headed up to the room only to find that our room key would not open the door. We had been locked out of the room because we hadn't paid for the second night!! We wouldn't have minded if their policy is that you must pay up front but we were pretty cranky that they hadn't told us but had let us find out the hard way! We didn't see or hear any other people staying at the hotel in the time that we were there. I guess the best things about the hotel was that we didn't spend much time either.

This is a great hotel but there are some things you should know before selecting it. I'll try to cover all the aspects in my review. *Room* - The room was clean but very \"Asian\" What I mean by that is it was SMALL by American standards. Also the bed was HARD. I liked that it was hard, but I am used to hard beds from other Asian trips, but if you need a soft bed look else where! When I say hard it is almost like they took a wooden box, covered it with a thick mattress pad, and then put sheets around it. There was an A/C that worked well and was very necessary for Singapore. There is also a mini fridge which was great for keeping water. The hotpot was very nice and FAST. It looked brand new. I was pleased that they supplied packets of instant coffee, tea, and \"CeReal\" along with spoons and real ceramic cups. The \"CeReal\" was some kinda of instant corn/porridge/oatmeal type breakfast food. Not much and not substantial, but a nice way to start the day and a nice touch, especially for a low end hotel. The internet worked well and was free (one of the reasons I picked the hotel). The LCD TV was nice as it took up little room, although my set occasionally had sound issues, but that could have been the cable signal and not the TV itself. There also seemed to be a DVD player, but I never used it or really bothered with it. There is *NO* alarm clock so bring your own or use your mobile/cell phone if it has that feature. The closet was SMALL and shallow, so you have to hang your clothes at an angle to get them to fit. The toilet and shower were in a room, but the sink was in the main room. I've seen this setup before and it was fine for a single traveler. The bathroom did have an extra drain in the floor, so when the sink was used you could hear the sound of the water from this drain. Not a problem, but just odd. The shower required quite a bit of a step UP to enter. It looks like typical Asian showers that are designed to allow people to SIT in them. The shower worked perfectly fine and I was very happy with the temperature and pressure, again just something for foreigners (Americans) to be aware of if stepping UP and DOWN into the shower is a problem physically for you. *THE HOTEL* - I arrived at about 2 am from Changi Airport and had no problem checking in. The hotel did a good job of making up the room and replacing towels. The desk did ask me on the second day if I needed the whole room made up and I told them all I needed was the garbage thrown out and fresh towels. When I got back the garbage hadn't been emptied. When I mentioned this to the desk it became clear that \"garbage\" wasn't a word they really knew as they speak more BRITISH English, so refer to it as the \"Rubbish Bin\" not the \"Garbage Can\"... Otherwise I never had communication issues at the hotel. The lobby area and the lounge are both quite nice. The gym looks excellent and I had intended to use it, but it was hot enough in Singapore that just walking around each day was a good workout! I have a picture of the gym, note that the gym has ZERO privacy if that is a concern. The desk said that to use the gym you have to ask for it be unlocked. The hotel desk has a notice about a free shuttle service that runs in the morning. I never used it and it was never clear to me when/how it ran. It is a short walk to the local SMRT (metro/subway) station so was never an issue. *LOCATION* Now lets discuss the location as this is a big plus and a big minus depending on who you are and what you are looking for. Singapore is a VERY modern city and this hotel is located in the \"Red Light\" district... What that means is that many Singaporeans live their whole life in Singapore and NEVER come to this neighborhood because of the reputation. HOWEVER the \"Red Light\" district in Singapore is better than like 50% of the entire parts of MOST cities... Leaving the hotel in the morning and the area looks almost deserted and empty. It is ONLY if you return to the hotel late at night (say after 9 pm) that the area looks scary with lots of people, mainly men/laborers, walking about. If I were a single women traveling by myself, or a family with young children, I would either make it a point to be back earlier in the evening, or find another hotel. Of course another option is to take a taxi (cheap and easy in Singapore) and just have it drop you right at the hotel. The UPSIDE to this neighborhood is that food is CHEAP and plentiful. This area is especially known for fruit sellers and the fruit is also cheap and plentiful. As an American there were PLENTY of fruits here that I had never seen before but only read about and enjoyed trying them all. Eating durian is a must, at least to try it, but do NOT buy any to bring back to the hotel unless you have an AIR TIGHT container (zip loc) type bag or similar to seal it in as it DOES smell! Do not be afraid to try the various food stalls/markets. They look scary but are fine. Generally you go up to the stall you like, tell them what you want...and then sit. They bring the food to you and you pay them for the food when they do. When you are done you leave the tray/plate/etc on the table. The whole area is definitely NOT touristy but instead feels more \"authentic\" The best way I can explain it is this...if you LOVE visiting Disney World and love how everything is neat and clean and controlled, there are definitely OTHER hotels in Singapore for you...but if you like visiting a place to see the \"real\" life of people there...then this is an excellent neighborhood to stay. I enjoyed my visit to Singapore and am glad I stayed here.

I could imagine a family of five in the tiny room, with chain-smoking dad sleeping in the tub, abandoned cigarettes slowly burning down to the filters. We ate our first-night deposit and fled to a significantly more expensive place (220 SGD). Sometimes you just have to suck it up and pay the price.

Luckily I found Santa Grand Aljunied through booking.com with all the good reviews. I booked a family room with one queen and one large twin bed for less than what hotels were charging for just one bed. We decided to forgo staying in the better location to have a better suited hotel for a fraction of the cost. I noted on our booking that we would arrive around 2am and were warmly greeted by the receptionist. There is one elevator which seems to run slow, but as long as it\u2019s not busy you don\u2019t have to worry. The room is small, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s filled with two beds. It comes with free wifi, a safe, fridge, and hot pot. It looked like it had been recently refurbished. The beds are super hard, but I think that\u2019s an Asian thing. The bathroom is a little out of date and not particularly clean, even when we first came in. There is a local famous seafood restaurant down the street called No Sign Board Seafood which was good and had great service. In the other direction is a food court, all within a several minute walk. Taxis drive by the front of the hotel often so just walk down the drive way and wait for one. My only other complaint was on our second night we actually went to sleep at a normal time and you can hear everything going on in the hallway, the closing of the stairway door, and toilets flushing from neighbors. That and the slightly unclean bathroom were my only complaints. But, for just a two night stay we were more than happy with our decision to stay there.
