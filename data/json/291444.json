I wouldn\u2019t call this a gym, in fact I've seen home gyms with more equipment. One treadmill, one bike and a few weights is pretty poor. The second is the hotel staff in the lobby bar/restaurant. Serving customers seemed to be the last thing they wanted to do. On both days I had breakfast in the hotel I had to practically force the waiter to give me my bill.

Very importantly, there was no hint of noise from the bar when in the room and the lifts are off to one side so security is tight and controlled for guests.

Our room was comfortable - black out blinds, excellent air con, comfy beds with soft sheets. The only reason I haven't rated this hotel as 'excellent' is because it didn't quite meet the 5* standard in some ways - such as the shower (which went from hot to cold quite randomly), the check-in process (we had to wait for over an hour for our room to be ready despite arriving just after 3pm) and the spa opening hours (stated at 9am to 9pm but actually it only opened at 1pm which was a shame given that we had to leave at 11am on our last day). These weren't big issues, and were compensated for by the fact that this was more of an intimate and interesting hotel to stay in than many other 5* hotels such as the Mandarin Oriental. But that said, we felt there were a few teething issues which the hotel had yet to overcome and which perhaps were a result of this being an 'add-on' to the Tragaluz restaurant chain rather than belonging to an international hotel group.

Wifi, although free, was LOUSY. Service would fade in and out, never more than 1-bar in the room. When I complained soon after check-in, to ask about moving us, I was told it is the same service throughout. They sent a \"technician\" to the room to assist--this was a man who's only equipment was his own cell-phone, and he announced he could get on the internet and left (I was trying with both iPhone and iPad). On check out the front desk acknowledged that many guests had complained about the wifi. Location was great, easy walk to lots of food, clubs, and shopping; metro less than 1 block away. The rooftop pool is fantastic--small, but enough to cool off and there are many deck chairs and a bar. I tried a massage in the spa but it was closer to 45' than the hour I booked, and the therapist completely ignored my repeated requests to pay special attention to my very sore quads, giving me the std, vanilla full-body massage instead--nothing special.

Nonetheless, we saw the website, noted that it was in an excellent location, and it was rated 5 stars. WELL.....we arrived around noon to check into the hotel, but our room wasn\u00b4t ready. I assumed that since it was a 5 star hotel, tehy would have their housekeeping staff clean our room within the hour, but no...our room was not ready until 3pm (their original check-in time, despite being told it may be ready earlier). So we checked into our hotel room and there was sooooo much noise coming from the hallway. The doors are paper thin and we were hearing all the noise from the hotel staff cleaning the conference room on our floor (for some reason the conference rooms are on the top floor). We kept calling the front desk and they kept assuring us they would advise them to stop making the noise, but it didn\u00b4t. THEN they said they would transfer us to a room, but they moved us onto the first floor NEXT door to the spa (lots of traffic), and worse yet...above the disco!!! (yup, theres a disco in the hotel). So then we had to move all the way back up to our original room because the only other room they had was a \"superior room\" and they didnt want to give us the free upgrade. Anyway, you would think that they may give us a complimentary bottle of wine or something since we went through all this, but no...they gave us a bottle of mineral water!!! In terms of cleanliness, there were cruds of food or something left by the previous guest that went unnoticed by the cleaning staff, even after waiting three hours for the room.

The rating needs to lower significantly to reflect the actual quality of the hotel and the people running the hotel so no more visitors will be missled, like I did. After a 10 hours flight, I arrived at the hotel at 1pm and my room was not ready. The staff told us that it would be ready in an hour but after hanging around for an hour, we found out that this wan not the case. So no shower and no toilet for me after a 10 hours flight on a hot summer day in Barcelona for a hotel I have payed more than 200 euros per night. We went for lunch and got back at 5.30 pm. The staff told us that the room was now ready but our suitcases was not in the room, a sign for me that the room was just made up. On that evening, I went to the roof garden. There was a corporate event going on for AmEx and as soon as I set foot in on the roof, the hotel event manager appeared in front of me saying that the bar is closed, the space is occupied and but I can enjoy the view for a while. I think she got horrified by my pair of jeans and flip-flops but that is her problem. I sat there for 20 min and I lit a cigarette. And guess who I saw in front of me - the event manager once again telling me I should be careful not to drop the ashes out of the balcony. I was really shocked by her patronising behaviour. I was ready to start a seriour argument with her. I didn't though, as I respected her guests even though she clearly does not respect hers. In check out, we were 20 min late and the phone rang 4 times saying that we had to vacate the room. By then I was so mad I told them that my room was ready on check in at 5 pm ( they denied that fact which is a big fat lie), and that I give them 2 hours to prepere the room and that I will move out accordingly. I'm sorry I get into all that detail. What I try to say is that my Barcelona trip was not what I was expecting and the sole reason is the very unpleasant experience I had in this hotel, having paid top dosh for it. Other than that, rooms were ok (just ok), location central but very busy and noisy and drinks sky high prices and weak. Overall, an overpriced 3star hotel, on a bubly and loud facade.

It's in a nice part of town (chic stores, food, etc) and not in the tourist mess by the ramblas. It's also by the subway so you can get everywhere easily. My big complaint is that the service is lacking. Nowadays, especially at these trendy boutique hotels, you have nice design but the place is run by unprofessional, apathetic kids. They weren't rude but they weren't exactly professional or hospitable. There is a certain level of service I expect from a 5 star hotel that I didn't get here. Our room was delayed and the girl could only say sorry (no offer of anything or suggestions). For dinner reservations, they couldn't get tables at a couple of restaurants and made no other suggestions - again, the blank stare and \"sorry\". When I stay at a \"top\" hotel, I expect that they have connections to get me into places I wouldn't be able to do on my own. If it becomes more work for me, then the value of paying for a tops hotel is lost. I might as well stay at a cheaper hotel if I am in charge of getting everything together. The other issue I had was more unique. Before I continue, I should let you know that when our room was finally ready, it was a bit run down: paint needs to be done, the closet was broken (and not fixed) so I couldn't get my clothes, the furniture was a bit banged up. They had a CD player on the wall which seemed a bit dated and could have used a Ipod dock or something. Also, I hate it when the hotel offered communal tubs of soap, shampoo, and cream! It just seems cheap (and unhygenic) when they don't offer individual sample sizes of the stuff and it is not very luxurious. Also weird layout where the toilet was in a separate room around the corner from the bathroom. So, when we came back from dinner on our first night at like 1 am, we get to our room and the door doesn't work. We go back down they insist the key is broken but we know that it's an electrical problem since the light was off on the key slot. We go back and forth and finally they come up and it turns out that, in just our room, the power has died. I don't know why the power died but we end up having to pack all our stuff (at this point it's about 1:45 am) in THE DARK with the BROKEN CLOSET and move into a huge suite on another floor. The suite was great - huge, 2 rooms, etc. but I would have preferred a free night or dinner. I'm on vacation so I'm not spending a lot of time in the room so the added space was a deal breaker for me. They sent us champagne (which we don't drink) and that's it. Again, they made a 4 star effort when they are suppose to be a 5 star hotel. I did like the bed-very big and comfortable. Also, the room was very quiet so can't complain about that. Overall, it was ok. It was a bit of scene happening every night in the lobby and very hipster/media types there. Not really for me but some people might like that stuff. There is a Michellin star restaurant which was good but we preferred the Terraza del Casino in Madrid for science-food.

For my 23 year old daughter this was a great hotel selection in a central, busy part of town. We stayed 7 nights. She and I both enjoyed the street-side lounge with beautiful people and a great DJ, different each night. The location was amazing, allowing us to easily site-see and shop on foot, by taxi, or bus to all parts of the city. The modern design and large room for a boutique hotel, including a balcony overlooking the organic garden was comfortable and inviting. (We could have lived without the ugly wash hanging from the balconies of the apartments across the way.) The mood-setting light system once you figure out how it works is fun and quite adequate. The room had a table and chairs and a modified desk, which was nice. The bed was a bit too hard, but the sheets were starched and perfectly clean and crisp. We loved the robes. The bathroom lighting though is really dark for applying make-up. The make-up mirror, which didn't tilt was poor. The TV stations offered provided the news but not many choices. That could be upgraded, offering more stations and movies. We loved the curtains allowing us via bedside push button total darkness or half light. I liked the privacy of having the toilet and bidet separate from the shower and vanity. The concierge and front desk staff were unbelievably nice and attended to our every need. One door man ran down the street and stayed with us over ten minutes one evening to fetch a difficult-to-get taxi. The food in both the formal, Michelin-starred Moo and casual restaurant beside the bar is absolutely delicious...beautifully presented!! (way better than The Arts Hotel) My big complaint is the pretty bar and waitress staff at the lounge restaurant. They were impossibly, deliberately rude. A shocking contrast to the friendly and helpful front desk staff. My daughter thought the dark halls were \"cool\". I could have lived without that. But have seen this done at other chic boutique hotels. As I said, this is a perfect hotel when traveling with 18-35 year olds. My daughter went to the night club and liked it. She had a massage, but felt it was merely average. The business office was sufficient for my needs. They never did get our WiFi in the room fixed, but we survived. Since we played golf twice, and walked for miles, we didn't need the gym. Can't comment on that. At all times I felt safe and secure in my room.

We know Barcelona well, and have stayed at a number of the city's hotels in the past. We decided to try the Hotel Omm because it has had good reviews and is fairly central. Fortunately, we were out most of the time, and only returned to the hotel to sleep, because we found it impersonal and lacking in any kind of charm. The reception staff were pleasant, but rather remote, and as the lifts were very near the street door we felt that we might as well have been staying in an apartment, for all the human contact we had with anyone in the hotel. At no time did we see anyone - staff or guests - in the hotel corridors. The corridors were most peculiar: they were lined with what appeared to be black rubber, and the (very dim) lighting was provided by what appeared to be striplights under the floor, so that the effect was of a long black runway. Even at 9 in the morning, it felt like midnight. Our room was (of course) at the back of the hotel, and overlooked what was described as the \"patio\" - really a backyard, surrounded by flats with washing hanging out on the balconies and with people coming and going all the time, so that we felt obliged to keep the semi-transparent screen closed whenever we were in the room. The beds were very comfortable indeed - credit where it is due! - but we found a bad stain on one of the sheets and had to ask to have it changed. We also discovered a cockroach in the bathroom, which we mentioned in a note we left for the maid. It disappeared, but I don't know if that was because she caught it, or because it simply escaped. Rather annoyingly, our bathrobes were removed on the second day, and were not returned until the evening of the third day, although we rang reception to ask for them as soon as we realised they were missing. The bathroom arrangements were odd - the bath, shower and washbasin were in one room (part of the bedroom, really) and the lavatory and bidet were in another, at the other side of the room. Something that we found really irritating was the fact that the lighting system was quite complicated, and it was difficult to work out which button controlled which light. The light in the bathroom was feeble, to say the least - all very atmospheric, but useless when applying makeup We are used to high minibar prices in city hotels, but at the Omm the prices were outrageous - 9 to 10 euros for spirits and 5 euros for mixers - so that a gin and tonic would have cost 14 euros 50. Needless to say, we waited and went out to a bar off the main drag, where drinks were considerably cheaper. All in all, we felt that the hotel was not good value for money, and the ambiance was urban chic taken to the extreme.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antwerp, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cDesign hotel but not 5 stars\u201d", "Author": "SEVA01", "ReviewID": "UR83023859", "Content": "Hotel Omm is a design hotel with most probably used to be a 5 star hotel. To my opinion they forgot in last years that beside design rooms, they also have to offer 5 start service to be entitled to put a plate in front with 5 stars. The rooms (stayed in Superior room) were OK, clean and design, but you could already see that it is build some 7 years ago. The shower was not 100% fixed, the wooden plates in the bathroom were not so clean anymore, ... In these time, you should also expect a big flatscreen in a design room instead of a small old fashion TV (working well, but not OK for a room of 375 \u20ac/day WITHOUT breakfast). Talking about the breakfast : it was OK but very poor. Moreover it was served in the lobby, the food on the counter of the bar, were the day before we were drinking with a lot of people. There is a restaurant, but for some bizar reason, they are not using it. Maybe it is to much work to redo the tables after the breakfast ..... No live cooking (for scrambled eggs or pancakes), only one sort of bread, no fish, no champagne, no fresh juices, ... all this for 25 \u20ac per person. Something about the swimming pool : it is to small to swim. There is also steamcabine, but you have to wear swimming trousers because the cool off douches are in front of windows without any covering ..... strange. At night, the hotel is a hotspot for all people of Barcelona. This is a good thing, because you can enjoy the atmosphere and go to the club afterwards. Minus : we ordered a coffee and could not get at 23.00u (was not served anymore). We ordered a Mojito and .... after 15 minutes and 3 times asking ... it still had not arrived. So we decided to go to the club without drinks ... Anyway, to conclude, this hotel was a 5 star hotel but it is now maximum a 4 star. I would suggest to the manager, which we have not seen in 3 days, that he visits the Mandarin Oriental. We went there for dinner and the service and atmosphere was top. The people knew what to do and when. There was always a manager to guide them. To my opinion, having a lot of experience in managing companies, this hotel needs very quickly a very good manager. The people working in the hotel are doing what they can, but due to missing of a guiding hand, it is not working as it should be. If the rate of the rooms would be 150 to 200 \u20ac, I would say, OK.

There were a few quibbles; I found the lighting controls in the bedroom/open plan bathroom difficult to navigate, and I thought it was downright silly (and, frankly, unhygienic) to have the wc and the bathroom so far apart. We were upgraded to a very stylish suite, but there was long distance between the wc and the bathroom and nowhere to wash one's hands beside the wc. One has to walk out of the wc and right round the (very large and elegant) bed to get to the bathroom to wash! We could also hear the traffic very clearly so I would recommend earplugs.

OMM is not a cheap place, but it certainly exhibits that desire for excellence, that you would expect from a 5-star hotel.

The staff were also very kind and responsive in a polite and unobtrussive sort of way. The bed was extremely comfortable, with the now customary turn down service. Air conditioning was excellent - very quiet and set to the perfect temperature for a good night's sleep. You should be aware that some ot the suites/rooms face the inner courtyard which is not necessarily an exciting view. However on balance sleeping on the inside is probably the better option, because these rooms are very very quiet, so I (a troubled sleeper) had the best sleep in a hotel, I have had for years. The only rant I have is about the TV set, which was installed in a way that did not allow it to be viewed from the bed without one of the bed posts being in the way. If they had allowed a longer cable it wouldn't really be an issue. This can easily be fixed so I am surpirsed they actually missed it. Perhaps a word of caution to the owners of the property is that it is apparent that some of the interior is starting to show signs of wear (e.g. slightly dirty sofa upholstry in the lobby, scraped wall panels in the dining area of the lobby, discolored wood flooring in the pool area etc.).

We were showed to our room which looked like a cabin rather than what they were aiming for : a modern room. Maybe it was modern decor and I just don't get it ! I don't know. NOT FOR ME. There is especially one serious problem with the restroom : you have the sink and the tub in one end of the room, and then a toilet all on its lonesome at the other end of the room......that would extremely inconvenient and made no sense to me either. Is that part of being modern too ? Apart from that, the rooms are big, beds are comfortable, sleep is good provided that the air conditioner works, balconies are wonderful...I am trying to find more positive things to say but I can't.

The modern design is striking. The food is excellent. The bar is happening. The beds are comfortable. The lighting is difficult to operate. The service is good, but sometimes without a smile. The location is great for Gaudi, perhaps a little out of the way for the old town. Our reaction after experiencing it all first hand is that we really liked this hotel. I am glad we were warned about some of the less than stellar points, but we took it all in stride. After a full day of touring beautiful Barcelona, it was so nice to come back to our zen retreat. Upon arriving, we were offered a complimentary upgrade because a larger room was available for immediate occupancy. We really appreciated this after our 10 hour overseas journey. We had an excellent breakfast every morning in the lobby (very Euro with lots of cheese, juices, fresh breads and cold pork). I am sure it is not the best deal in town, but we liked it enough not to try and search another out. If you like modern architecture, the design of the lobby is inspiring at every turn. The lighting and music (of vast selection) set the perfect ambiance and that holds true in the guest rooms as well. (Yes, it is somewhat difficult to figure out which button does what, but not worth getting worked up about--except maybe for make-up application). The rooms seem very plain at first glance, but it made for a relaxing retreat. I thought the low beds were really comfortable. We loved our long and narrow balcony overlooking the courtyard. It might not have the greatest view (of the backs of some other apartment and office towers), but the vines hanging from above were an interesting solution and it was very quiet. We had one meal at Moo (try the tasting menus) and thought it was really special with an inventive menu and excellent service. Drinks afteward at the lobby bar is great for people watching. The basement disco was too much techno for us, but could be fun if you like to dance and hit the right DJ night. Our room was on the second floor and we could hear people coming and going late at night, but it was not terribly disrupting. If you are a light sleeper, the hallway noise could be an issue. The rooftop bar was heaven in the afternoon sun--very relaxing and with views of more than one Gaudi building. As for location, it is a bit of a hike to the old city (about a 10-15 minute walk to Placa Catalunya), but we enjoyed the exercise. The shopping in the immediate area is great for luxury goods. We found the service to be always helpful, though not quite as \"butt-kissy\" as some other hotels of similar price. Be prepared for direct answers to your requests without a lot of smiling.

The location is also excellent, if you want to be in Eixample--right near a Metro stop and tons of shops/restaurants. The biggest disappointment is the functionality of the rooms. The layout, while visually striking, is not user friendly at all. The toilet is in a separate room, separated by the bed and a giant wall from the sink/shower. The walls are paper thin. You can hear everything that goes in the hallway and nearby rooms--make sure you get a room away from the elevator. The lighting proves to be the biggest drawback. You can only turn on and off the lights from switches next to one side of the bed. And to turn on the light in the toilet room, you have to turn on all the lights in the room.

The staff were very welcoming when we arrived but that is where the warmth ended. The rest of our experiences in the hotel left us wondering why a hotel that positions itself as five star would accept anything other than five star service.

We had arrived intending to eat in the Michelin star restaurant but decided that we would have a more enjoyable evening in another Madrid restaurant given the attitude of the floor staff in the lounge.

I live in London, and I love posh boutique hotels with an international flair...this perhaps looks the part, but very quickly you realise there is not much one you scratch the surface. The walls and the room doors are paper thin and not soundproof at all!! You can hear guests, but the worst part is that in the mornings you can hear the cleaning ladies who are nattering and yelling each other downt he hallways, vacuuming, etc and it will guarantee to wake you up...how can a 5 star hotel that charges upwards of EUR 300/night miss out on this crucial detail. Unacceptable.....and the only positive about the rooms is the awesome blackout shades...you can sleep for ages. Nice A/C as well, and my room had wireless, but in my friends' room - no wireless coverage. Fail. The bathroom & showers...poorly designed. Only a halfway glass partition, so without a shower curtain, the water gets everywhere. You can see the wood floor has water damage, and given that the bathroom is not enclosed, you don;t get a good steamy room for either steaming your clothes, or to have a nice steamy room for an after shower shave. The toiletries are in these unusable metal dispensers...also poorly designed. Room service - I ordered a tuna & asparagus salad which was delicious...but there was the tiniest morsel of tuna (like 3 tiny flakes), and one - yes ONE - spear of asparagus...and the salad was called a tuna & asparagus salad. Unbelievable. There is a hotel car parked out front...never offered a ride...what;s it for? The general hospitality of the staff is not great, which is typically a reflection of poor management - not much in terms of help or suggestions, etc. I also used the spa which was forgettable and i don;t really recommend it. The rooftop pool is tiny & underwhelming...hmmm, not great. Also, let it be known that the restaurant is shut in August, so was not able to check that out as well. I have no idea if the hotel bar/club was open cause no one at the hotel staff told us...and i could not be bothered to ask, so I ended up going to the Olympic Port near the Hotel Arts which is an area that is much much more happening in terms of cool bars, clubs and people. I would never stay here again...there has to be better places at better prices with significantly better attention to detail in construction and in staff.

I got upgraded to a junior suite. It was one of the best rooms I have stayed in! Very minimalist but done in a great way. From the shower, jacuzzi, bed...right to the huge projector tv that covers an entire wall! The automated curtains also kept out all sunlight when I needed to sleep. The pool on the top floor was very nice. It was packed though which is probably normal in summer. A little small...but then again, we are in a boutique hotel. Good service though by the two waitresses at the poolside bar. DInner was great. Moo was much smaller than I thought it would be but thoroughly deserved its Michelin star. Not too expensive as well. My only disappointment with the trip was that Ommsession was closed for renovations so I couldn't go there. To stay here, you would want to experience a certain type of holiday.

We are a well-traveled couple accustomed to staying at 5 star hotels. We have discriminating tastes and tend to be critical. Our comments: Positives Location After much extensive research, we chose the Hotel Omm for its location. Located right off the Passeig de Gracia and a short walking distance from both Gaudi's La Pedera and Casa Battlo, the Hotel Omm is an excellent choice for it's prime location. There are plenty of caf\u00e9s, tapas bars, interesting beautiful people watching and wonderful shopping located minutes away from the hotel. A Barcelona Turistic bus stop is also a 3-minute walk from the Hotel Omm. If you are visiting Barcelona for the first time, I highly recommend staying at a hotel located on Passeig de Gracia. Hotel Design As design aficionados, we liked the sleek, modern and overall look of the hotel. Our request for a room on the highest floor (6th floor) was fulfilled so our room was very quiet. We never heard any noise during our stay. Our request for early check-in was also granted. We stayed in a non-smoking Standard King room and took advantage of the 4-night stay promotion which we booked on Expedia. Our room was spacious and filled with plenty of light. The overall feel of the room is very minimalist and stylish. We had a view of an interior courtyard; nothing great but at least it provided plenty of light. I really liked the 2 pre-mixed CDs included with the CD player. The room also smelled lovely. Many other trip advisor reviewers complained about the lighting system but we found it to be fine and quite manageable. We loved the bathrooms and there was plenty of space for our toiletries. A complimentary bottle of water along with tasty chocolates were also provided daily by the hotel. Housekeeping does an excellent job. Our hotel room was always cleaned and replenished with fresh towels when we returned back to our room which was usually 4-7:00 pm. Front Desk Service The front desk members were all very attentive, polite, warm and friendly. We found them to be very helpful and patient with all of our questions/requests. I noted that after the first day, the daily bottle of water/chocolates were no longer being provided. As soon as I brought this issue to their attention, it was remedied right away. One evening, a staff member walked us to the corner of the street to help us hail a cab for dinner. One night, a front desk member printed out a street map so that we could walk to the Palacio de Flamenco for our show. Another time, a hotel staff member opened up the business center at 12:30 am so that we could use the computers. Overall, we were provided with excellent service at the front desk. Roof top From the roof top/pool area, you have a magnificent view of the rooftop warriors of La Pedera. It makes for a fabulous photo op. Negatives Uncomfortable Bed Unfortunately, the bed was not comfortable. As customary in Europe, a King size bed means putting 2 double size mattresses together. Since all the beds are platform beds, the mattress just was not plush enough for us. Since we have back issues, every morning we woke up with sore/stiff back and necks. We would have been happier with thicker/memory foam mattresses. We have platform beds at home with Tempurpedic mattresses which are far more comfortable than the bed we had at Hotel Omm. Rude Hotel Bartender On a Tuesday night, we had drinks at the hotel lobby bar after dinner. We were shocked by the incredibly RUDE bartender who sneered at us after taking our drink orders and threw our drinks on our table with such disdain. While serving us, he barely glanced at us. He has a goatee and a slick ponytail; he definitely fit the \"look\" of the trendy hotel bar. Although good looking, he obviously must be a frustrated soccer player/model/actor wannabee. We were by the far the best dressed couple in the hotel lobby and yet he treated us like street riff raff and not paying hotel guests. In fact, we made a point to write on the bar bill \"No Tip - Bad Service\" in both English and Spanish. During checkout, I also made it a point to tell the front desk how rudely we were treated by the bartender and that it\u2019s a comment that I personally read several times on Trip Advisor and that the hotel manager should be aware of this issue. The second time we had drinks at the hotel bar, we had a female bartender who was much nicer. Overall Asides from the uncomfortable bed and very RUDE bartender, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. We didn\u2019t eat at the hotel. Although the menus looked appealing it was a bit too expensive. The restaurant is a gorgeous space and frequented by well heeled locals. We also didn't have a chance to check out the spa which also looked nice.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLoved Hotel Omm\u201d", "Author": "pastular18", "ReviewID": "UR33797745", "Content": "Beautiful and comfortable hotel with a sexy bar, restaurant and roof top pool.

They lacked with both. Hotel itself looks nice, since it was New Year period it was full but it only consists of around 60 rooms. It is part of group Tragaluz which owns around 13 bars and restaurants around Barcelona. On every single request for recommendation and reservation for any of these restaurants they were completely not interested in help, they even didn\u2019t bother to call any of their restaurants and ask for a table, whatever we asked answer was the same: no. Even for their own bar hey didn\u2019t allow us to use empty tables claiming that they are for dinner, for the rest of the evening tables were empty and no other place to sit as hotel bar is hip place in Barcelona, or at least want to be. We used SPA once and they told us that we can not use all the areas, we complained and their reply was be happy that we stayed open for you, it is new year day. Unbelievable. Bathroom amneties were broken throught our stay, nobody bothered to change them. Absolute climax was last night when we ordered tea in room, first we waited for around 30 minutes, strange for a hotel with 60 rooms. I called and lady told me that she forgot, then in another 15 min she brought tea but without honey, I called again and she brought honey, I complained about service and she told me that staff is aware of the problems but she is the only one working in room service and left. I took honey but it seemed strange, it was soy sauce. I talked to manager we were given last night as complimentary, and no room service was charged.

I happily tagged along for the week long trip. We stayed at Hotel Condes de Barcelona for the first half of the trip, then moved to Hotel Omm for the second half. Although both properties offered comfortable accommodations and were centrally located (two blocks apart from each other), Hotel Omm's attention to detail and really swanky/cool atmosphere made it a much more enjoyable and luxurious place to stay. I would recommend having drinks in the lobby along with all the fashionable people in Barcelona (mix of international and locals). Then have a soak in the deep tub with views of the city (they provide bath salts as an amenity) before hitting the town for dinner at 10pm like the locals! Before bed, you will find two gourmet chocolates on your pillow in a sweet little gift box, plus two bottles of water - always a plus! In the morning, definitely splurge on the buffet breakfast where you can have all the iberican ham, spanish cheese, and cava you can handle. Yummm! There is also parking under the hotel (not sure what the charge is) and the internet is free - another plus! The staff was extremely helpful and they all spoke English.

Great idea. Omm spa is excellent and reasonable. Staff are brilliant if a little 'stiff' at first. We joined in for the \u20ac250 x 2 dinner on New Year's eve and it simply wasn't up to either the hype or price. The food was just not any more than average. The waiters forgot one wine accompaniment. The breakfast was nice indeed and very low key but one of the best. Lots of fresh fruit, and tapa style elements. Now the bad stuff and where this place fails... The rooms are nice in concept but cheap materials are now starting to let the place down and badly. The walls were marked and the tables chipped. Also, the shower and toilet are on one side of a large partition and the bathroom and washbasins were on the other side . Go to the loo and you either use the bidet to ablute or schlep around to the bathroom. The interior designers need to be dragged back in to see how their concept is working (or not). Thus, the room was very disappointing indeed and minimal is confused with 'cheap'. The water in the shower was constantly warmish (but never enough) at a push and the shower attachment on the bath-side leaked water onto a wooden floor. Additionally, we went for a walk after dinner and the goons on the hotel door were exceptionally rude ( a la guest list manner one finds on LA) when we returned and said we were staying there...

The rooms however are fairly average. There are some nice touches (compliation CDs in the room, mood lighting) but the whole place feels a bit clinical and unwelcoming.

We had the same issue as someone else with the iron! The hotel said they weren't able to provide an iron but could iron clothes for us and then presented us with a bill for this!

Yes, the pool is smallish and unheated but it was lovely and relaxing with great views. A respite from the city heat. We found the staff really friendly and helpful, making reservations for us and generally giving advice. The bar area was cool and quite packed at night. We didn't try the nightclub though. As my husband is a real foodie so we had a meal at Moo. All was good but I would give it a miss unless you are really into innovative food as you have to order 5 or 6 courses each and they're all quite small.
