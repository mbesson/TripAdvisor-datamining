The hotel is only a 20 minute walk from the Empire State Building and 30 minutes from main night life like Times square and Broadway. The room were very clean and tidy and up to a very high satndard. However, the main problem there is the terrible slow lifts, which go straight past you even when you've pressed the button. If your in a hurry and on the 15th floor like i was then i would recommend to take the stairs. I only had a packed lunch styled breakfast as we were leaving early in the morning to go out sightseeing.

The rooms are very tight and I agree with some of the reviewers that the beds seemed shorter than usual. However, the room was spotless and everything worked. I did not have trouble with noise. We were in a two queen room and these are actually larger than the king rooms, so when I say tight I mean it. The hotel is well located for Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The best part of the hotel is the restaurant - run by a very affable chef who genuinely enjoys cooking for his guests. The food is mostly Italian but the cheeseburger was great too. There were good specials every night and the bar area was generally full with two or three large screen TVs for sports viewing. There is also outdoor seating for the restaurant. We ended up eathing at the hotel restaurant twice because we liked it so much. Front desk staff were efficient and friendly, but you could see that with a crowd they might get overwhelmed. When we left, the doorman offered a car service to the airport. I could have sworn he told me $39 but when we got in the car the driver told us $79. I simply apologized and we got out and took a cab, but this appears to be an issue based on some earlier reivews. As it turns out, the car service price of $79 wasn't too far above the taxi fare to Newark airport.

My expectations were not huge, and I can say that they were met. The hotel was clean, the staff friendly and it felt very safe. We paid extra for an Empire State Building view, and it really felt worth it. It was so lovely to see the building lit up in lights every evening. We also got a great view of the Chrysler. The hotel is in a good location, though it is slightly further from Times Square than I would opt for in future. It's a nice walk to Times Square, but the number of road crossings as well as the busy streets, means it often takes longer than most people would like. The train station (Penn Station) and tube stops are within a few blocks, and so its very handy for travelling in and out of the area. It gets much quieter from 34th steet around Macy's to 26th street where the hotel is located, especially at night, so it can feel a bit less safe. But I really found no trouble. One downside is there aren't many restaurants in this immediate area, so it's not so convenient for grabbing some food on a busy evening. Other downsides - there is no safe in the rooms, the lifts are slow, and the rooms are tiny. These things are not massive issues, and are easy to accept in any 3 star hotel. I would just urge to keep room size in mind if booking in a group. We travelled in a group of 3 and opted for a room with two double beds. It felt extremely cramped, as there wasn't anywhere for us to lay our suitcases or properly store all our things. It was fine for the purpose of our relatively short trip. However, we had considered travelling in a group of 4, and would have opted for the same room size - this would have been a much bigger problem, and I'm not sure how we would have squeezed 4 of us in. Overall, if you are in NYC to see the sights (who isn't?!) and want reasonably priced accomodation that is fit for purpose, then don't hesitate to come here. If you want something a bit more spacious, luxurious or closer to Times Square, then be prepared to pay the higher price.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOk location.

The complaints about the elevator waiting times depend upon the time of day. These sliver hotels should really have a dedicated elevator for service personnel. As there were some repairs taking place in the hotel when I checked in, the trip to my room on the 24th floor took about 10 minutes. The king rooms are quite small. I asked for a corner room with two double beds and the room was somewhat larger, although I still managed to band my foot on the furniture while accessing the wardrobe. Fortunately, there was a nice view of downtown which made the room more bearable. There was no soap in the bathroom and the tv volume was not working. The internet connection was also very slow. Also, be aware that there is no safe in the room. Although there is an ironing board, I am not sure exactly where it would fit if one had to iron. The bed was comfortable; however, there was some banging noise from the construction which came through to the room. The parking garage was a block away at $30 with a validation sticker from the hotel. There is another garage right across the street, which would be more convenient. I also noticed food delivery men going right up to the rooms without having to stop at the front desk. As the rooms did not have safes, I did not feel comfortable leaving valuables in the room when I had to step out. I was greeted as a Priority Club Platinum upon arrival and offered a choice of a snack. The upgrade to the corner room was appreciated as well.

Sixth Avenue and 26th Street is not a bad part of Manhattan at all, close to everything including Madison Square Garden where I was seeing a concert. - The price was very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. At $129 a night it was less than half the price of the Hilton Fashion District which is on the same street a few doors down (my other hotel option). - Free in-room wifi - and it worked well! - The room was clean and in good condition. It was certainly nothing special and it was small but overall fine. Things I disliked: - The ridiculous elevator situation! There was only one functioning elevator for a twenty five floor hotel which was shared by all guests and staff - including housekeeping. Even if both elevators were working I don't think it would have been much better. It was like taking the subway trying to get to my room on the twenty-first floor - I'd wait for fifteen minutes wondering if I'd even fit inside the packed elevator once it arrived and then it would stop on numerous floors on the way up, sometimes letting housekeeping staff in and out with their trolleys. Many people were annoyed by this! - I was told no housekeeping after 4:30pm (I wanted my room cleaned and couldn't get it done). - There's no late-night room service (after midnight). Not a problem for everyone. - Thin walls - the conversations from the hallway regularly woke me up. - I think security at the hotel could be better. - The lobby is cluttered and a mess - it doesn't give a great impression when you first walk in. Overall, it's not the kind of place where you'd want to spend a lot of time actually at the hotel.

I have never had any complaints with the service over the cleanliness of the place. One time I had a problem with the TV remote they got someone to me quickly and another time I got there and the toilet in the bathroom I was assigned was running. They insisted on sending someone up to check and when they agreed that the toilet was running they apologized and moved me because they did not have a plumber at that hour of the night. Stayed there last week and the room was just fine. They actually upgraded me to one with a view on a high floor. I don't think I would pay extra for the view but it was fun to look out at night and see the Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, etc. all light up. The standard rooms are small. A desk, chair and a bed. No comfy chair if that is important to you. I have grown to like the neighborhood because it is fairly convenient for what I need but it is not fany like one of the major midtown hotels. 26th Street is nothing special for the most part but not too far away there are some nicer places to eat, etc. I have not tried the hotel's own restaurant but have heard nice things about it. Bottom line if you want a comfortable place to stay this will do the trick. Shop around on the price because some times it goes way up and even this trip I made the reservation on the Holiday Inn web and then they cut the price twice so I kept calling in for the lower price before my stay.

There are only two small lifts which can be a bit annoying if your waiting for a while but that's not a reason for marking the hotel down.

That's a very basic service, but since there was no fuss, not really a big deal. My main gripe relates to the fact that we had pre-booked a room with twin beds as part of a tour package (I was traveling with my father) but when we checked in, they had no twin rooms left, and didn't seem to care at all that a father and daughter would be forced to share a king for two nights - no apologies, no offers to see what they could do for the second night. They don't reserve specific rooms, they just give away whatever they can. Poor customer service. Waiting for the elevator was another major pain - one always seemed to be out of service, and the single available forever to arrive - cue irate crowds gathering in the lobby with huge cases.

Right in the middle of a heatwave, this hotel had a very welcome, very efficient air conditioning system. The location is good; we walked to Greenwich Village in 10--15 minutes one way, and Times Square was equally accessible in the opposite direction so we walked almost everywhere. Popcorn shrimp and Margaritas at Bubba Gumps on Times Square is to be recommended (the chain is more commonly found on the west coast and it is more appealing when you're actually on the coast, looking at the Pacific!). Rooms were spotlessly clean, but very small (not a major problem because presumably you didn't come to NY to sit in your room) and you need to do a little dance around the loo if you want to close the bathroom door, but the view........... just wonderful. The toiletries provided were rather mean (one small tube of everything). There is a bar attached to the hotel but everything is frighteningly expensive. On the downside, the hotel lobby is tiny, and often crowded, the woman on reception was brittle and the hotel doesn't have a service elevator, so there is a bit of a scrum between guests and staff to access the 2 tiny elevators available. The bag store is on the second floor and it took for ever to get our bags back when we wanted to leave. Be warned; you will struggle to get a yellow taxi to JFK between the hours of 3.30 and 5pm, as the drivers end their shifts then and will just refuse to take you. You can get a black private hire taxi, but it will cost you $80 instead of $35.

When the window is open however, there is more than a share of noise to disrupt your sleep. The room was definitely cramped, not nearly enough space for three people (two double beds) in a small room with limited closet space. One of the double beds was right up against the air conditionier. The staff members were very friendly and polite, but we soon discovered that there was a serious lack of communication between them as well as a lack of conveying accurate information to us on several occassins when we asked for their assistance. When I spoke to the manager at the end of our stay about these instances, she was very apologetic and informed me that there were a few staff members still in training, and they should have been more careful.

Rooms are very clean, nicely decorated and have most of the amenities required including an excellent HD tv with cable and on demand movies. No safe deposit box however which is at reception. Beds are really comfortable and we received room service every day. I paid extra for an empire state building view which was worth it. Truly awesome. One down side was the hotel transportation run by a company called Jubilee. You will be offered this by reception. We had a bad experience with this so maybe avoid. The driver was completely crazy and his driving was awful causing my wife to be sick. Not the hotels fault directly but one to note.

We arrive in the early evening to an amazing view from our hotel room window of mid town NYC and the Empire state building in all its glory, Then noticed the lack of a cot. We contacted reception and were told one was on its way.... some hours later still no cot. I went down to reception at 10pm when we could wait no longer to be told then that they did NOT have one as they were allocated on a first come first served basis, then proceeded to hand me a pile of blankets so our baby could sleep on the floor!!!! Needless to say she did not but spent the night in our bed (against our better judgement). We copmplained to the manager the following morning who promised faithfully that they would have one for our second night. First day sight seeing done and exhaustion setting in we returned to our room at 8pm only to find AGAIN no cot for our daughter with a message from management saying they did not have one and for the inconvinience we could have some extra priority points and breakfast! I could not believe this, they expected us to put our baby on the floor again! At this point we had had enough and I went and demanded they got one from a near by hotel and was not moving from reception till they did, needless to say they found one after some frantic phone calls. We have never had service like it, I simply could not believe that after pre-booking a cot they could (after check in) just not supply one and expect us to put her on the floor, as if we would! We have complained to holiday inn and it would seem that despite their satisfaction promise, mentioned all around the hotel, the customer service is as poor over here as it was there, we have been passed from pillar to post and still no joy, Still trying though.

Basically, our room on the 11th floor (out of 24) was clean, quiet, functional, the bed was very conformable and the free wireless connection worked perfectly. Albeit on the small side, it provided a nice and cozy retreat from the buzz of the streets after a day of Manhattan shipping and museum visits. All would therefore be well if it wasn\u2019t for the common parts: the hotel only has two small lifts so we had to wait for over 5 minutes to catch one taking us down in the mornings. We would have taken the stairs but they were closed for maintenance at that time of the day. Going up was complicated too; we once had to wait for over 15 minutes because a group of half a dozen guest with their luggage had arrived at the same time, cramming the minuscule lobby and queuing in front of the elevator doors, making the place look like a metro platform at rush hour. Staff was indifferent on the verge of uninterested, on one day our room was not cleaned, when we indicated it to reception in the evening after having noticed it, we were told matter-of-factly that it was \u201ctoo late\u201d now. They didn\u2019t offer to give us at least fresh towels. All went well room-service-wise during the rest of the stay though.

The room is very small. Even for New York. You can't walk in the bathroom and shut the door, you have to squeeze around the door. The closet is an armoire, so not a lot of room to hide things away.

Overall a wonderfull hotel and goes straight to the top of my personal list of manhattan hotels", "Date": "September 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, keep it in perspective!\u201d", "Author": "Visidigi", "ReviewID": "UR41034351", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights towards the end of August and we have to say we were very impressed overall. Prior to arrival we were in touch with the hotel about having some parcels delivered before we arrived, the manager took charge of the requests and kept us and his very attentive staff informed so they were there when we arrived. Lets get this in perspective, this is a hotel on Manhattan island, right in the middle of things and therefore space was always going to be limited. When you compare it with the hotels at four times the price you may have a case for saying the rooms are small, but realistically, for the location, price and the amount of time you will spend in them they are just fine. I will say its likely to be the bathroom that has caused most of the 'small room comments' as it is on the small side, but again its perfectly usable. Our room wasn't ready as we were there early (around 1pm) but we were able to leave our bags and set off stright away, advised to come back around 3pm when they expected the room to be ready for us. The room we had was an 'upgrade' from the standard room we would normally get for our rate, we had a 19th floor Empire State building view room which, whilst the same size room (all rooms are similar at this property, there are no suites etc, just standard rooms (seems to becoming more common with franchised IGH properties)) was better due to the open air feeling and the lack of brick wall outside the window. The room was good, sure it wasn't huge, but like central London hotels, size costs money and realistically when you can get this hotel for $100 a night if you are smart about booking it really can't be beaten. The elevators have caused people to comment, sure sometimes there are long queues, but this seemed to only be when they had large parties checking in or out of the hotel, other than that we really didn't have any issues during our stay. The internet was free, a great bonus considering some IHG locations charge up to $20 an hour for access in Europe, it wasn't the fastest thing on the planet but it was fast enoguh for our needs and greatly helped us to be sure we filled our days as best as possible. There are free PC's n the business center in the basement too, when you can print off tickets etc for free - excellent facilities overall in this department. We didn't eat breakfast or any food in the hotel during our stay for many different reasons. The hotel food wasn't cheap, the breakfast wasn't cheap and it wasn't in the nicest of locations. The doors into the Bar/Restaurant are very 'office like' and the layout of the facilities aren't inviting. The bar itself is 'lit' poorly with battery powered LED lights too dim for the size of the room. The cafe desperately needs to have tables and chairs outside, for some reason during our stay these were piled up outside and unusuable - maybe they were packed away for the winter, although with temperatures around 83/85 on our stay they could have been useful. Over all though, Peter (the hotel manager) and his team have a good little hotel here which we wouldn't hesitate from staying in again, nothing was too much trouble and it was great value overall.

However, there is a bar and restaurant that provides a larger space to socialize away from busy crowds in the lobby. I was amazed by the friendly service the front desk provided even with people crowding at the desk wanting to check in, check out, ask for directions, and complain. The employees are able to handle such stress and maintain a friendly smile throughout the craziness. We stayed on the 16th floor wtih a view of 26th street. The double beds were really comfortable, but as other travelers stated, the rooms were fairly small. The bathroom itself had a tiny sink, but four people were able to manage a weekend in this tiny room without any issue. I did not hear any noise coming from the hallway since some of the doors to the rooms are tucked in small hallways. As far as the elvator situation, we really had no issue waiting between the two in the building. It ran up and down quite fast so there was no issue having to wait for a long time. This elevator is in comparison to The Pod, which unfortunately ran slow and was smaller. We had drinks at the bar and the people there are so friendly and will make you some strong drinks. However, it was pricey like all other bars in NYC. The neighborhood is really interesting since it is mixed with tourist, straight, and gay people around.

The subway are on 28th and 23rd street, but would reccomend 23rd street since its busier around the Flatiron Building and provides multiple tracks (RWFV). Cheap breakfast can be found at A Taste of NYC on 23rd and 6th (literally eggs,sausage, and hash brown for under $4). After hours dinner and good dessert is on 23rd at Malibu Diner. There is a bar next door to the hotel, but there is also Rogue around the corner. This bar felt like the employees were snobby so we didn't go there again. If this is the new look for Holiday Inn, then I definately agree they have stepped up to a level of competition with Hilton, Sheraton, and Radisson. This hotel was very comfortable even with small rooms, the bed was amazing. Its ambience and exceptional customer service made the place bigger than it really was for a weekend stay in NYC. The neighborhood is far enough from the crowds of Time Square, but close enough to see the lights on the corner of 7th and 26th. I definately would stay here again since the neighborhood offers all nearby attractions without the noise and crowds of NYC. Holiday Inn is a tall secret on 26th street that will make a memorable stay in Chelsea, NYC.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia", "Title": "\u201cMet Our Expectations and More!\u201d", "Author": "scarletman1972", "ReviewID": "UR25474383", "Content": "The reviews that we read about the hotel were realistic and well written.

A lot of people dont seem to like booking hotels that are only 15,000 points a night but we've never had any problems anywhere in the world. My only question is.....why is this only 15,000 points a night ?! We arrived after a long flight UK-Amsterdam-JFK and took the subway to Penn Station. Its no more than a 10 minute walk but on the way back we got the subway at 23rd St which is even closer. On arrival we were greeted with a big welcoming smile and check in literally took 2 minutes...if that. Reading other reviews we though we would wait ages for the lift but it wasn't a problem. We were given a room on the 23rd floor as I had emailed saying it was a surprise break and the views were magnificent. Looking over the Mahattan skyline. Ok so the rooms werent the size of a suite from a Hollywood movie but they were immaculately clean with everything you needed...a very comfy bed and a spotlessly clean bathroom with large wet room type shower and all of the soaps, shampoos etc etc. A large flat screen TV allowed us Brits to look on in amusement at the millions of TV channels while we unpacked and there is free interent as well. Wired and wifi. Everytime you walk in through the front door or out of the lift the receptionists always greet you with a friendly hello and a smile. People may think this is 'the American way' but it doesnt happen everywhere in the States I can assure you. Walk out of the hotel, turn left and then left again and you have mini supermarkets and some cracking deli's for that New York feeling of getting bagels with all sorts of hot and cold fillings and a couple of coffees to go. Walk out of the hotel, turn left, cross over the road , up to to the next block and trun left and you are on Broadway and from here it is a 10-15 minute walk and you are in Times Square. This hotel is no more than 15 minutes walk from Times Square, Empire State, Penn Station, Madison Sq Gardens etc. People have said they have to wait for the lifts. One morning we waited about 3 minutes. ANd it probably stopped at most floors on the way down as the maids use the lifts as well. Total...about 5 minutes. Whats 5 minutes out of your life when you are in New York on holiday? The few times we used NY taxis it was no more than $5 to the hotel including tip. This hotel is central and clean and new. The barmaid behind the bar the couple of times we wnet in was annoying in that everyone had to know what she was doing, where she had been and how she was this or did that...but hey...you're in New York. We only popped in as it was happy hour and we were just cominbg back to refresh before we headed back out. At the end of the day, this is an ideally situated hotel in the centre of town that is clean...spotlessly clean...and has the same size bed as any other hotel. The same size wash basin, the same size toilet, the same size coffee mugs and the same size window. The maids make no noise. The views are spectacular and rather than spend $55 on a yellow cab from JFK, spend $5 on the Air Train to Jamaica central and then $2 on the blue E line to either Penn Station or 23rd St and walk 2 blocks.

This hotel has only been open 7 months, so not everyone knows about it. Location is good--it's halfway between the F/V (6th and 23rd) and 1 (7th and 28th) subway stops, although the 1 is slightly closer. There are convenience stores, drugstores and restaurants just steps away: CVS and Duane Reade on 6th, Chipotle and BRGR on 7th. I recommend Supermac on 7th just south of 29th: multiple varieties of macaroni and cheese. Received an \"upgrade\" on arrival to a king bed on 14. Small, NY style room, and really tiny bathroom (bathroom even tinier than the ones at the Radisson Lexington). But everything was clean and comfortable. Flat-screen TV with many stations, about 1/3 of which didn't come in. FREE INTERNET! (Wired or wireless--I went with wired--but be sure all the ethernet cables are connected properly.) I had no noise problems--I could only hear people if they were in the hall outside my door. It was super cold during my stay, and it was kind of hard to keep the room warm because the cold kept radiating from the window, but it was better the last day when it got up to freezing. Staff was pretty friendly for a NY hotel, greeting all the guests as they got off the elevators (no long elevator waits, either). The bartender even changed a $100 for me. The only problem I had was one day when I left my room at noon, it was not cleaned when I got back. I called down and someone came right up and changed the towels and made the bed. I appreciated that; I've had hotels tell me I was out of luck before when that happened.

So, sometimes we had to wait ages for it, especially in the morning. And other times, it was too crowded. We were on vacation, so it was OK - but for those in a hurry (i.e. businessmen), it wouldn't be so great. Secondly, breakfasts were not included in the price, considering we paid US$350 per night. Luckily, there were two McDonald's nearby - one on 6th Ave and the other on 7th Ave (24 hrs). The nearest subway station was two blocks away on 28th.

We recently stayed there for one night at the start of a holiday and then four nights at the end. The first night we were in room 2507, on the top floor under the air conditioning system! A fabulous view towards the financial district did not wholly compensate for the noise level. Our twin room was, in the American way, funished with two double beds. While this worked in other hotels we stayed at on our trip it meant that, in the small rooms that this hotel possess, it was difficult to open, store and manoeuvre around two farly large suitcases. Our four nights were spent in room 807. There was still a noise problem from both within (an air conditioning duct runs down the inside wall of the '07' rooms) and without. I think that the bedroom windows should have been triple glazed, which would not have added a great deal to the cost of this recently opened hotel. As other reviewers have noted, lifts can be an issue. On our last morning one had broken down, a seemingly not uncommon occurrance, and it took my partner about 20 minutes to get down to the lobby with her case - she only managed that by getting in the lift while it was on the way up!
