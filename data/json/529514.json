When i arrove around 2 am after a long work & travel day. As soon as i get to the hotel there was Roxy at the front desk, she was really friendly & inmediatly she gave me the keys of my clean & cozy room. I was really surprised about it because i expected to get in trouble with the check in & check out times but fortunelly it was non a problem in this hotel. By the time i got into the room i was really happy everything was clean & also had a good stuff, the bed was excelent, i sleept like never i did. The breakfast was really full & also good stuff a real German breakfast i loved it! The location is good just at nights i found a bit complicated or longer to get there by the public transportation but not impossible. In my opinion i got more that i expected by the price.I have to tell that i work in a luxury 5 stars hotel & trust me that im able to qualify this hotel as a good hotel. i recommend this hotel to people whos looking for a low cost & clean hotels. I thak all the staff who was really friendly & made me feel like at home in my short stay in this beautiful city.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cA Penny saved...\u201d", "Author": "the_travellin_man", "ReviewID": "UR25871056", "Content": "The best thing about this hotel is its cleanliness.

The staff were very friendly and went to a lot of effort opening the bar for us when we arrived (even though we were the only customers) and lighting all the torches and candles in the outside courtyard. The breakfast was very good and the location was good to travel into the centre of Berlin using the trams.

The hotel is located above a billiard hall, the rooma start on the second floor and there are no lifts. The entance and the stairs are dirty and littered. Our bedroom was not cleaned during our stay. A request for an extra pillow resulted in a folded quilt, without a pillow slip.. The buffet breakfast food was left uncovered. The table cloths were dirty. The bed was comfortable and the hotel is convenient for the City Centre with good public transport but that is all that can be said for it.", "Date": "June 23, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fortuna", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d529514-Reviews-Fortuna-Berlin.html", "Price": "$46 - $79*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Jacobsohnstrasse 20</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">13086</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "529514", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0b/a5/0ba500719bffdf248c23915ad66bf97d5large.jpg"}}
