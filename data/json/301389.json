{"Reviews": [{"Content": "quiet hotel After having a bad experience of spending a night at another Prince Hotel (Shinagawa) we found this hotel . It is clean, quiet and very comfy. We had the view on the Tokyo tower, quite flashy at night ! The service was extra fine, employees so helpful. The only thing wrong with this old hotel: it needs to redo their rooms that are quite outdated.

We were in Tokyo in 2006 for a 1 1/2 weeks. The had gotten a great hotel/flight package for the first week and had stayed at the Century Hyatt. We extended our stay and was looking for an affordable, convenient hotel. This hotel was listed in our guidebook. We called up the property, then went there by taxi. The moment we walked into the lobby we were already apprehensive. It looked old, worn, and dirty. We went upstairs to our room and the moment we got there, we knew we wanted out. We spent only 15 minutes in the small, dingy room, and that 15 minutes was spent looking for another hotel. We found one for the same price that the Prince was charging ($180/night!!) and quickly moved to the Radisson Miyako in the Ropongi area. WOW! What a difference!! The only good thing was that the front desk was quick to let us out. All we had to say was We don't like the room. We want to leave. The reason we got off so easy, was because we had contacted the property directly. Another tourist behind us was desperately trying to cancel his stay, but appeared to have a much harder time, because he had bought the room through a travel agent / online site. Poor guy. Don't stay at this hotel, if you want a pleasant stay in Tokyo.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR515206241", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "luvs2travel17"}, {"Content": "Pretty darned good!!!

As soon as we got to the Tokyo Prince Hotel, however, we were quite disappointed. The carpeting throughout the hotel looked water-damaged. The bathroom had mold in it. The wallpaper in the room was peeling. The headboard and bedskirt were stained, and the electronics looked like they were from the early eighties! The room was small, which isn't something that bothers us as we've stayed at nice, small hotels before, but this room just grossed us out! While the location was great - right next to the subway, across the street from Tokyo Tower, within walking distance to Ginza, it was rather disheartening to come back to a dirty and dated room after walking all day. While some may say a hotel is just somewhere to sleep, keep in mind that Tokyo is a large city - not easily walkable, and you'll want somewhere clean (at the very least) to rest after a long day.

Basic hotel which we understand was used for the Olympics. Rooms are small (but expected as it is Japan). Choose carefully as some of the rooms may smell like smoke. The front desk was kind enough to switch us out to another room. The upholstery is a bit 70's on the verge of 80's but you spend your time outside so it's bearable. The bed is flimsy, definitely not your Serta, but decent for a good night's rest.Its location is pretty much midway between the major sites such as Ueno Park, Ginza, Roppongi, and walking distance to Tokyo Tower. There is a beautiful temple and park right next door to relax and business personnel come here often. Only downside is that it's right in the middle of the business district so when nighttime falls, most places close down including restaurants. It's an easy walk from Hamamatsucho Station.Overall a decent location to stay for a few days but not recommended for extended stays.

We stayed at the Tokyo Prince Hotel very recently. I rated this hotel above average because of the cleanliness of our room and the great service the staff provided throughout our stay.This was the hotel that was closest to where my husband was teaching a course. I would've preferred staying at the new Prince Park Tower Tokyo - which is literally behind this hotel... but the rates were much higher and company bugets are always an issue. The concierge staff was so very helpful. Gave us wonderful directions and suggestions.The hotel lobby is not fancy at all and there is no executive lounge or gym... but you can access the gym at the Prince Park Tower - its about a 2 min walk.The hotel has a lovely outdoor pool and is right next door to a temple and a small city park - very woody.The hotel is across the street from Tokyo Tower. So that serves as a great reference point once you are walking around.We didn't try many of the restaurants in the hotel, since our very kind Japanese host would take us out to dinner in the evenings. But we had breakfast every morning at Porto. It's the western option and it's served buffet style. They had various types of eggs as well as meats and some asian dishes, and croissants and regular breads and rolls, coffees, juices, yougurts. For lunch I ate in the Grill Kitchen almost daily. For a very reasonable set price you would get a soup, salad, rice or roll and a very nicely prepared meat or chicken or seafood entree. Again, the restaurant staff was wonderful and very professional and I have to say that I really enjoyed having my lunch there. I know I could've walked to the nearby American Chain restaurants, but it was so nice just to find a quiet place to catch-up on some reading while having my meal.", "Date": "Jul 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR741778363", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "RobertsMom"}, {"Content": "As bad as they say This is a truly terrible hotel apart fromThe windsor bar which is okayThe staff which are okayThe location which was okay cost \u62e2140 a night and truly terrible value", "Date": "Apr 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR395789206", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ecossealba"}, {"Content": "Old but decent Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in mid Feb and didn't find it as bad as what was posted in the earlier reviews . The hotel seems to be popular with conference attendees as we saw loads of them over the 4 days. Got a pretty good promotional price ( US$107) for a double room. Room was a little old but overall clean and of an average size by Tokyo standards. Staff was friendly and helpful, even changed our room from 2 single beds to a double when we mentioned needing to use the internet which was not available in the first room we got.The metro subway station was only 1 minute away, in front of the hotel.
