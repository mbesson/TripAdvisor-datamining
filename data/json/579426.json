I ate at the bar, the menu was limited but I can recommend the ravioli. The room was small but clean. My view was a wall and if I was staying longer I would have changed it. The hotel boasts a Hamman (Turkish Bath). I had a Hamman and a massage and whilst I can recommend it I thought it was a bit expensive at 230 lira. If you have more time or are organized you should go to one of the original hamman's in town - Cagaloglu Hamami looks particularly good - www.cagalogluhamami.com.tr The gym was adequate and breakfast was the usual Radisson level. The hotel is not in the centre but 3 miles away from the old town. However I really liked the location.

Twice I stayed in the Teksim area. This time I decided something different; to stay at Ortakoy. This area is bang on the Bosphorus. The only other 2 hotels besides this one are the Four Seasons and Cigran Palace. Both of these are upwards of 400 euros a night. Radisson is half the price and pretty damn good. It is located in a small alley at the end of Cigran Palace. I had booked online and got a rate of 195 euros for a standard partial sea view room. The room is decent size. The sea view is also pretty decent although not direct but at an angle. Comfortable bed and a really powerful shower. The room is pretty good not to warrant an upgrade to the next category. The hotel also has free wifi. The food and drinks are expensive in the hotel. The area is pretty lively (although nothing compared to Teksim). Within a 3 minute walk there are about 15-20 bars and cafes where you can eat and drink and also have a turkish water pipe (nargile). A lot of these are on the sea front with a great view. I checked out and to catch my flight but did not get a ticket that day so came back to the hotel. While the hotel looked empty they conveniently had no standard rooms available and the desk pushed a business class room on me. I did get a bit of a discount on that room type but it was clear that the person at check in new I needed the room and was pushing me a higher revenue room. This was unprofessional. The rate did include breakfast. The business class room was bigger. I had one on the 5th floor and here you had a direct view of the Bosphorus from one side of windows and an angled view from the other. It was a bit bigger in size. Everything else was almost the same as the standard room. The breakfast in the morning was nice. I personally like Ortakoy a lot more than the hustle bustle of Teksim or Sultanahmet and I love the sea view. So I will repeat the hotel in future.

This place will take your breath away at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Have breakfast feet from the Bosphorus River while watching the seagulls, ships and small boats sail by. You will also see the mosque and bridge. It is truly my most favorite spots in all of Istanbul. For lunch you can choose from many of the higher end places or sneak across the street and enjoy kofte, icli kofte and cig kofte, all staples in Turkish cuisine. As for dinner, the sky is the limit in Istanbul. I highly recommend the restaurant located above the Storks Jewelry store located next to the Spice Bazaar. The views at night are some of the best. Then there is the night life around the hotel. If you want to drop $5 for a beer or $30 at a club you can. The hookah bars are located right on the water as are many of the bars. Moving back to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6the driveway is a little steep, so be careful. But you are always greeted at the door and the service is amazing.

We stayed here because it is the least expensive one (by far, most of the time). IF you can get a room that faces Sultanahment (the older part of town with Haghia Sophia and Topkapi Palace) on the fourth floor or higher, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay here again (I think the category is called Superior). If not, there are some less-than-great rooms and views and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a long way away from town. The hotel is a couple of miles from Sultanahmet and is virtually under the first Bosphorus bridge in a charming waterfront neighborhood named Ortakoy. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 45-60 minute brisk walk from the last stop on the tram (or 15 minute bus ride). As a result, you will be spending a LOT of time in taxis, on buses (which are fine to take and cheap but are VERY crowded) and trams (also, cheap, easy but get A LOT of use) to get anywhere. There is just one waterfront road out to the hotel. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only 3 lanes and, as a result, very crowded on weekends and at rush hour. We read a lot about getting ripped off by cab drivers in Istanbul on this site, so we stuck to the buses and trams (atypical for us) until our trip back to the airport... of course, we didn't have any problems with the driver on that trip so maybe we played it too safe. The hotel is newly remodeled, and they did a great job with the redo. It doesn't have much of a presence on the main road, however. The property is long and narrow\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not much frontage on the water or street. Most rooms have side views (except for a few suites in front and a few rooms on the street), and if you are on a low floor or too close to the street, you won't have a view and you will hear a lot of traffic noise, especially on weekends. The rooms were nicely furnished and newly done, but are small. The designers cleverly conceal that fact with mirrors so it doesn't feel claustrophobic. Just know there's not a lot of room in your room. A big plus was the free wifi in your room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it engendered a lot of good will from us. The staff was nice and friendly every time we had to contact them. We had dinner in the main restaurant once (there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a popular-with-upscale locals sushi restaurant)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 excellent pepperoni pizza for 26 Turkish lira. It's not on the main menu, but ask for it. The location of the restaurant is great\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 right on the water and the night weekend manager was really pleasant. We had breakfast at a Starbucks about three blocks away every day and found a grocery store and liquor store in the same area, so it's pretty convenient for stuff you'll need. We had drinks & dinner in the bar at the Four Seasons Bosphorus every night... great service, excellent food. That hotel has a beautiful promenade on the water. The public spaces are stunning, as is the restaurant Aqua. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the Bosphorus too well from the bar, but you can eat/drink outside weather permitting. Also checked out the Kempinski Cirigan Palace (friendly staff but tired-looking facilities... WAY overrated and full of loud Americans with name tags... and basketball hoops on the Bosphorus in front of the old palace section... what ARE they thinking?) and the Ritz-Carlton up the hill, which is like a stuffy trip back to 1992 (but again, with a friendly staff)\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 beware, they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even mow the lawn in the entrance area! Istanbul doesn't have too many hotels that aren't dated inside (and as a result, a little sad), so the Radisson is a good choice if you want to be on the water. If not, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay here. If we came back, I'd stay here in a Superior Bosphorus view room here or, more likely, in the cheapest room at the Four Seasons Bosphorus to take advantage of their gorgeous facilities.

The tram line is great but the hotel is a long distance to the nearest tram line (which takes you to the major sights _blue mosque, Topkapi Palace, Hagia sophia , grand basaar) and we could never navigate our way on the bus system.

Ortakoy is not dead-centre, but is a popular area for discerning inhabitants of Istanbul. The Radisson Blu Bosphorous is about a 30-40 minute taxi-ride from the airport (rush hour permitting) and is tucked away off a main road, at least at its rear. Inside it is plush and clean. The staff greeted me warmly and were very efficient. My room was very clean and tidy, with twin beds and a modern bathroom. The hotel offers free internet connection and a modern flat-screen TV. Downstairs, the cafe & bar give you a hint of the real assets of this hotel. There are great views over the Bosphorous including, on a clear day, a glimpse of the Topkapi Palace and the Hagia Sophia mosque. Outside is a terrace restaurant which is right by the water with great views of the Bosphorous Bridge. As my visit was in January, the outside terrace wasn't in use, but it must be a spectacular place to have dinner in late spring and summer. I can't think of many negative points. Several of the main tourist sights (eg the Blue Mosque) are almost 10 kms away - but then Istanbul is HUGE. My laptop also got infected by a 'trojan' via the hotel's free internet access. aside from this, I'd say this has to be one of the top 'hotels with a view' in Istanbul.

The down side is that with traffic, it can take roughly 30 minutes to get to any of the major tourist sites in Sultanahmet. The hotel itself is a Scandinavian business hotel. Tastefully appointed, but sparse in design, the hotel is clearly purpose built. The rooms are on the small side, but very comfortable and for the business traveler, they are more than adequate. You will not find LCD TVs or iPod hook-ups, but you do get internet and a very comfortable bed. Some of the rooms have partial views of the Bosphorus, but do not count on getting one as they are rare. They do have \"Business Class\" rooms which will give you a better view and more room, but they are significantly more expensive. The service is of high quality and very prompted and helpful.

Since this was the last night of our vacation, I wanted something special. I had booked the second highest priced room, a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bosphorus\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room with the understanding that this was a room on the Bosphorus Straight (waterfront) side on the hotel. When we checked in, I showed the desk clerk my receipt from Expedia showing prepayment. I was asked to provide a credit card, which I assumed was needed to cover any extra charges. We were given a room on the street side of the hotel. When I complained and again showed the front desk the Expedia reservation they explained that no other rooms were available. So instead of a room overlooking the Bosphorus, we looked down on one of the busiest streets in Istanbul. At checkout it was clear that I had not received a credit for my prepayment through Expedia. Once again I showed the desk clerk, and then the manager, my receipt from Expedia. Despite this the manager insisted I owed the full amount without my prepayment to Expedia. We were then in a hurry to get to the airport, and I assumed that this could be fairly easily corrected later. Little did I know that it would take six months plus to resolve this matter. In the process of trying to straighten this out Radisson applied two different credits which made no sense, and then a charge which was also incorrect. Over time, I made three lengthy telephone calls (one of which was an hour and 45 minutes) to my credit card company attempting to resolve this matter. After each of the three phone calls I provided detailed follow up letters to my credit card, because the agents continued to be understandably confused by the Radisson transactions. Finally, six months later on May 1, 2009, I received a correct refund. It will be a long time before I stay at a Radisson again. Also, my conclusion is that I will not book through Expedia again. I just adds an intermediary that can confuse matters. In addition, Expedia requires prepayment, when if you booked directly with the hotel they seldom require prepayment. Note that Expedia is typically collecting a healthy percentage of the room charge (I believe 20%), plus keeping the same percentage of the room tax (for which they have been successfully sued by local governments) plus then charging an added fee. You often can get a lower rate by dealing directly with the hotel. Why not give the money to a well run hotel, instead of Expedia, and avoid the prepayment?", "Date": "June 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "U.S.", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Service at Four Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "drummingtosca", "ReviewID": "UR32714666", "Content": "The location of the Radisson Blu Bosphorus, right on the shore of the Bosphorus at the foot of the Bosphorus bridge, cannot be beat.

The restaurant's outdoor terrace is right by the water, allowing diners to gaze at the blue waters, boats, and the Asian side of Istanbul while dining. It's quite a romantic view. The service at the hotel was fabulous. The staff at the front desk was always helpful, checking taxi rates for us, recommending ways to get around town, and talking to drivers for us when the driver didn't speak English (and we unfortunately didn't speak Turkish). The hair salon delivered a great head message for me and an impressive old-fashioned shave for my boyfriend. The general manager of the hotel deserves special mention for his attentiveness, friendliness, and discreet demeanor that reminded me of a true gentleman from bygone eras. One evening, when we took a long taxi ride to Karakoy on the Asian side, our taxi driver tried to cheat us by taking a route that was twice as long as was normal. We discovered this (why do such taxi drivers always assume we haven't been to the place before just because we don't speak the local language, or that we won't have a map with us?), and an argument broke out at our destination when we would only pay the amount that the hotel quoted us as the usual fare. When it looked like the taxi driver wouldn't back down, we called the Radisson to ask for translation assistance, and the general manager did a great job intervening in the matter, brokering a compromise by phone so that we could get out of the situation safely. He then did follow up after we returned to the hotel to make sure we were ok. We were very impressed by this level of service. The only negative things about the hotel were that I felt the room decor was too utilitarian and that the restaurant food was overpriced yet ordinary. For those who had rooms with a view of the Bosphorus, the lack of interesting decor probably would not have mattered much. However, since we had a room overlooking the street and the garage, it just felt like any room in any corporate hotel in any part of the world, a dark one at that since the buildings across the street blocked direct sunlight. The restaurant service was great, but the food had no flavor and was nothing special. Yet, a dinner for two with no alcohol came to about $90. In contrast, when we ate out at one of the local restaurants, which offered Turkish dishes with rich flavors, we only paid $20 total for two people.

As it was effectively the beginning of our honeymoon, we had visited Istanbul a few months beforehand to make arrangements and had requested that we have a particular room with a view in which we would also use to take photos. This was arranged beforehand, but come the day, we were not allowed to enter the room (which we had previously booked AND confirmed verbally (both in English and Turkish, and so understanding their reassurances in different languages!) as it had been allocated to someone else! Furthermore, despite having received the okay beforehand, we were told not to take bridal photos in the lobby as it would disturb other guests - insane! There was no one there, which is how I usually find the lobby at the Radisson, and furthermore, how could 5-10 minutes of snapping a bride disturb anyone? After a lot of apologising from the desk manager (a nice guy, but had obviously been overruled by his faceless and unforgiving management), we were shown a smaller room with a view (not as good as the one we had booked), but which SMELT terribly of sewage PLUS could hear the nightclub downstairs VERY clearly. Nice start to our honeymoon. I still wish to this day that I had booked the Kempinski Palace as the honeymoon treat instead! Breakfast was nothing special (Swiss Otel Bosporus breakfasts are far superior), the usual clinical fare. Having stayed at a lot of 5 star hotels in Istanbul, I would recommend the Marmara for a cheaper stay and Kempinski for a more luxe stay or one of the boutique hotels in and around IStanbul (though a lot of them are not that central).

We paid 210 Euro per night for a triple room which is reasonable nowadays for a 5 star in Istanbul.But this price did not include breakfast - they charged us 20 Euro per person for the buffet breakfast - which we indulged in once.Other mornings we either went straight to town or went down to a cafe in Ortakoy where u can get a Turkish Breakfast platter for around 12.50 YTL per person. The Hotel has a Hamam - They charged me 140 YTL for a 40 min's Turkish massage and use of the sauna and spa.Comparable rates in first class Hamam's in town,albeit NOT in a 5 star hotel,run for c 60 YTL for a similar experience. The hotel also has a hair dresser and we made the mistake of bringing our 9 year old daughter for a hair cut.I have very little hair left but I was convinced to also have a shave,manicure,head massage etc. Before we knew what was going on they charged us 225 YTL (c $200) for the pleasure.When we contacted the reception to complain they checked with the salon and returned to us explaining that the prices we were charged were actually quite reasonable for a 5 star hotel in Istanbul. Just for futur reference anyone who go's to Istanbul will notice that they have more hair salons per capita than any other place in the world I have seen! Just stop into any decent looking one and you will get spoiled rotten at 1/3 the price we paid. All in all the Radisson SAS is not the place for tourists - there is no shortage of 5 star hotels in the Taxim area or the Sultanahemet tourist area.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Radisson Blu Bosphorus Hotel, Istanbul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d579426-Reviews-Radisson_Blu_Bosphorus_Hotel_Istanbul-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$284 - $752*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Ciragan Cad no 46, Ortakoy</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34349</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> (Formerly Radisson SAS)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "579426", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2b/63/2b6307428ac50e2a78041b55d8ea5b6f1large.jpg"}}
