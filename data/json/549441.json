We replied that it was the cheapest option on the website we booked through and were told they could give us a twin room for no additional cost. It was terrible. We are not fussy, we only wanted somewhere in a good location that was clean, but the celing in the bathroom had big chunks of paint peeling off, the room had not been vaccumed and my friend found a hair (we are both blonde and it was dark) on her pillow, in addition to this the mattress of my bed was sagging below the bed frame. The next morning we had a phone call at 7:45am from reception saying that we needed to chage rooms as we were given the room in error. After arguing for a few seconds we realised it couldn't be any worse than the room we had already been put in so agreed to move to another room which was much more comfortable. What was annoying though it that rather than the staff apologising and explaining that the room should not have been offered to us, we were told we had to move rooms without apology or explanation. Apart from this though the staff were friendly, although we did hear other people complainig (without an apology being offered) and they let us leave our suitcases in the hotel for the rest of the day after checking out.

I immeditely checked the bed sheets and found them torn and a few black stains on them. the door had what could only be described as severe termite rot.

Due to bad planning, the whole LA trip was a dissappointment, and the pathetic conditions at this hotel was the last straw. Let talk about the hotel first. The couch, chairs and comforter was stained and very dirty. we were scared to use them for fear of contacting some illness. In the bathroom, there was no dispenser/holder for toiler paper, and the tub wouldnt drain quickly enough. The room had a very strong smell of detergent when we entered, and I had to keep the windows open for about 20mins to make it bearable. The staff are friendly/rude depending on whom you talk to. Atleast one person gave me the wrong information regarding a city tour I booked through them. The hotel is situated in a neighbourhood, that is desolate after about 10.30pm, and made me feel unsafe. So if you dont have a car, make sure you are home by 10.00. Although, since it was my first time in this city, I might have been a little paranoid about our safety. Better be safe than sorry. The breakfast is nothign but some bagels and coffee, and you'd be better off eating out. But unfortunately, there are only fast food places available in near vicinity. There is no coffee maker, fridge or microwave in the room. Given the location, maintenance, unclean rooms, bad breakfast, I dont think its worth paying $80 for a room in this hotel . This is just \"cheap\", and not \"cheap and value for money\". Pay a little more and stay someplace closer to hollywood. Now about the whole LA trip. From my incomplete research, and talking to a few friends, I though it might be possible to avoid renting a car in LA and see the city using public transport. One reason was to avoid commuting in LA traffic, and also to avoid the hassle of finding a parking spot everywhere I go. I was partially right and wrong. The LA Metro rail is quite useful in certain areas of the city like Hollywood blvd, Universal studios etc. But if you want to visit Santa Monica beach, Beverly hills, Rodeo drive etc, be prepared to drive a car. Everywhere you go, you have to pay some $20 for parking. Luckily, we signed up with a city tour, and they took us around to many places which we couldnt access through the Metro rail system. We booked flights that used Burbank airport instead of LAX, and saved time from and to the airport. But you cant reach Burbank by metro rail. I read somewhere that its possible to reach LAX using metro. If I were to visit LA again, I would rent a car while I am there. For some places, I would still use the Metro rail.", "Date": "March 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cWorest places I have ever stayed\u201d", "Author": "hills168", "ReviewID": "UR13585781", "Content": "This hotel is even worse than any low developing countries.
