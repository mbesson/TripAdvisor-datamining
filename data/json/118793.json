{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Ultimate Dive Hotel If you like dives, this is your place. Old, moldy, cigarette scented rooms with windows that don't lock, porn on the TV, stains on floor (and elsewhere). Also, the place is across from the state mental hospital and teems with cheap, ugly prostitutes. Don't take the wife or family! This is a good place to go with a friend to get drunk and experience a dive.", "Date": "Dec 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR861100411", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Drtravel2"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d118793-r23000717-Log_Cabin_Motel-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "118793", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
