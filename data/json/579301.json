It is right in the middle of the busiest street in town, there is an open air bar/club across the road from the entrance and another in front. If you are outside your room all you can hear is a thumping of music from 2-3 different clubs... which doesn't make for a relaxing stay. I think due to the noise issues they have recently sound proofed the rooms, but not great if you like some fresh air as you need to sleep with air con on and doors closed to avoid the loud music. Even with the doors closed you can still hear the bass. Postives are that it is an interesting design, the patio room is small with no proper separate bathroom (shower is in the room itself with just a curtain), but that is okay for short stays and you most likely won't be in your room that much and hopefully enjoying the beach. Negative is that front desk staff should not be trusted - we had two incidents, one where we found front desk staff taking cash kickbacks from agents across the street who rented us a car. We ended up overpaying for the car and found out that we overpaid as agent was taking a large commission and front desk staff was also taking a commission. Car was recommended by the front desk. Also check your bill thoroughly upon checking out, we found that items had been placed on our bill - food and drinks that we didn't consume, and whomever did this had forged our signature, must have been staff involved as no one else would know how my signature should look. So please check the bill thoroughly upon check out. I wouldn't come back here to stay, nice to see, but think there are probably more relaxing places to stay.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "Claire C", "ReviewID": "UR122630383", "Content": "Hotel Basico belongs to the Design Hotel chain which is a well selected group of boutique hotels for their unique design aesthetic and standards.

A shower in the bedroom. Hot pink neon lighting. A magazine called \"Animal\" on the nightstand. This, my friends, is Hotel Basico, the stuff of dreams -- that is, if you ever wished to fall asleep. Couples must find these rooms to be intoxicating temples of modernist passion, with the elevated platform bed serving as an altar devoted to hedonist pleasure. But sadly, I stayed here solo, and wished the entire time that I wasn't. Not that I didn't have the most perfect stay, in every way. As a matter of fact, it is my favorite hotel I have ever stayed in, and if you tell me you slept in my \"Claudia\" room on the corner, I would be fiercely jealous. There are personal inner tubes and soccer balls to take to the beach on a whim. Two circular pools adorn the industrial space on the roof, inviting you to pleasure yourself in both. Breakfast is a plate of local fresh fruit, juice, coffee, and toast, and when I asked for milk for my coffee, it was served warm, without my asking. Hotel Basico is in the heart of the tourist action, but only a short walk from authentic Mexican restaurants catering to locals ike El Sarape and El Fogon. There's a taxi station 10 feet from the hotel's outdoor lobby, and Colectivo and the main bus station are just a few blocks away. Playa del Carmen (and Mexico, for that matter) is one of the safest places I've visited in many years. The rooms have recently been sound-proofed, and you can keep the fan on at all times, so the music at night is barely audible. Still, a pair of ear plugs and half an ambian aren't a bad idea to ensure a perfect night's rest. Stay at an all-inclusive resort if you wish to be boring, but bring the hottest partner you can find if you want to live life on the Hotel Basico edge.

My husband and I stayed at Basico several years ago (maybe 2006?) when it had just opened and it made a lasting memory in our minds. It is a gorgeous hotel. Staying there made us feel 1000x cooler then we'll ever be and that pretty much summed it up for a review...then. Fast forward to today--The hotel is still gorgeous, the staff still looks like models and it still makes me feel well, maybe 100x cooler but my love of the hotel were quickly squashed when our toilet broke...and remained broke for the entirety or our stay. They tried to fix it with, get this, a trash bag drawstring. It immediately broke again. Go figure, a trash bag didn't work. So we had to improvise and use a coat hanger to operate the toilet from the inside of the tank. The bathtub was super cool and larger then most hot tubs. The downside was that the drain was about as good as the one at my house, i.e. clogged. The most disappointing thing about the room was that the sliding doors (the giant glass sliding door/walls) are all rotted, off the rails and unable to slide open anymore! This wasn't just our room (trust me we checked). That was one of the best features...an open room with an ocean breeze...no more. The worst part is the door frames have been painted over and the doors are permanently slightly open just enough to not block out any street sound. This is not an issue if you only want to sleep between 4am to 6am. The last two things I must mention is this; my reservation included a free breakfast and complementary waters. Upon check out I was charged $7 for the waters and $20 for the breakfast. You see, the food part was free...the girl putting the food on our table cost $20.

Bottom line is this hotel is 100% about style and design and 0% about being a real hotel. Example, our room did NOT have a sea view and were told that upon arrival. In fact, there are no longer Sea View rooms. More like street view, where basically the entire street can see you through the poor excuse for curtains. Also, the toilet did not work and we asked for them to fix it. It was ultimately NEVER fixed despite mentioning it more than once. Unacceptable. Oh, air conditioning might have helped. Upon arrival we were told it did not work so they gave us fans... which is supposed to make us feel better? Lights in the room might be nice as well. The bed is under-lite to be cool i guess, but heaven forbid you need a ceiling light where the rubber tire is hanging (i'm serious). In the morning you are awaken as the temperature slowly rises to 120 degrees and the sun burns through your eyelids. However, that is a great time to take a cold shower because there was no hot water option when i stayed there. At night, the party is on, with the DJ blasting house music even if there is no one at the bar. They give you earplugs to compensate. If you have a toothbrush there is nowhere to put it, that apparently isn't a necessary design feature. Upon check out i was told that the \"owner doesn't want to spend the money for maintenance.\" Staff are very nice except have absolutely no power to help you. This hotel was designed by a local that looks at Wallpaper magazine but has never been in an actual hotel room. Oh, if you go and the website and look at the beautiful hipsters that are supposed to be staying there, we were those are people, and we aren't coming back.

It had been 5 yrs since we had been to Playa and we are very disappointed that the commercialism of Cancun is quickly leaking into what used to be a chic setting with alot of charisma. We were even more disappointed to see the sleepy little beachside resorts being replaced everywhere with large condo complexes, we will probably never go back to Playa again for just those reasons. Back to Hotel Basico...we read as many reviews as we could on this place and were aware of the \"pitfalls\" before booking our stay. Ultimately the location and easy access to everything in Playa won out and we decided to stay there. The Hotel is very chic and sexy and the location couldn't be better if Playa was what Playa had managed to remain for so long. But still it is very convenient to walk right out onto 5th Ave. and immediately submerse yourself in the Carribean life. The rooms are very comfortable for a romantic getaway, somewhat small, but who really spends a whole lot of time in their rooms anyway? I do have to register a complaint about the big sliding doors in the room, ours at first didn't open, but they sent up maintenance to open it for us. We didn't really have a good view from the room we were in, but it was still nice to be able to open it and let the breeze in, though we most often used the AC, which worked very well in the room we had. If you are overly shy and private, the \"blinds\" don't really obscure all that much, but unless you are right in front of the window, you have decent privacy. The rooftop pool has nice vistas, but isn't really very functional. The beach club you have access to is very nice and we spent most of our days there, however, it is quite a walk to it, not that my wife and I mind the exercise, but it did get a little laborious about the 5th day. The music at night is loud, worse some nights than others, but we usually had little trouble sleeping through it. The hotel is veeeery gay friendly, so if that kind of thing bothers you, you might consider staying somewhere else. We are the kind of people that are live and let live, but I don't really care to see it in all its glory.

They told me it was because of the hurricanes and it was dangerous to open them. This is utter crap. The other room had their windows open and all the other hotels also.

He booked directly with them and was given a rate for the room. CHECK-IN: When we arrived and checked in, there was some confusion about the price of the room and a higher rate was quoted to my partner. After pointing out that he had received a lower rate confirmed by email, the original quoted price was reconfirmed. Hopefully this was just an innocent mistake... Watch out for the fact that the initial prices don't include VAT OR local taxes though! (This is stated on the hotel's website). Check-in is from 3pm - we arrived a couple of hours early and they said they would have our room prepared within about an hour and we could leave our bags with them, so we took a walk down to the beach nearby. HOTEL - General: The Basico is a design-conscious hotel for the young and trendy. The fittings and furnishings are mostly made from recycled objects. The rooftop has a bar, comfortable 'beds' to lounge on, and two small pools in the form of large vats. Very cool. Surely the location of many a fashion photo shoot. At night there was music on the rooftop, and we could definitely hear it quite clearly from the room we were in, though being heavy sleepers this didn't bother us too much. There is a restaurant at the hotel and breakfast is available (surcharge) - we didn't eat there so I can't comment on the food. The staff were generally friendly, and young and trendy like most of the other guests! According to the hotel website children are not allowed. ROOM: The room was one of the 'patio view' ones. It was interestingly decorated - slightly 'clinical', but with a few quirky touches (flippers under the bed, a Polaroid camera chained to the bed - film for it was available in the room at an extra cost). The bed was metal-framed and quite high up - I felt like I was on some kind of (admittedly comfortable!) operating table!! There was a mirrored wall behind a set of hand-basins, the exposed pipes serving as towel rails. What with the Polaroid, the operating table bed, the mirrored wall, and a fluorescent light, it seemed like the set of some kind of porn movie! The room was accessed by a sliding glass door, and the rest of this wall of the room is also glass. There were rubber strips which form curtains on this window-wall, but, as mentioned by another reviewer, you feel quite exposed to the view of people walking past because the 'curtains' are just a number of strips. We could see into our neighbour's room when she had the curtains 'closed'. The toilet was in a small cubicle on one side of the room, and the shower on the other side of the room. It consisted of a large shower head over a square, high-sided tub - not your average bathtub or shower, but it had good water pressure! There were shampoo and conditioner provided in quirky, ketchup-style bottles, and a bar of soap. There was a small amount of hanging space, one drawer and a useful pull-out stand under the bed for luggage. Other room details: * TV with DVD * Stocked mini bar (prices are provided in the room) * Telephone * Wireless internet connection * Air conditioning * No hairdryer or safety deposit box in the room itself, though these might be available if you ask at the front desk. * Water - In some hotels in Mexico we've noticed that drinking water is provided, since drinking the tap water is not recommended. There was a glass bottle of water in the room, but it came with a price tag of $50 Mexican pesos! (approx. USD $4.50/ 3 euro) * There was also a small container with cotton wool and cotton buds - with a price tag of $250 Mexican pesos!! (approx. USD $22 or 15 euro) - that HAD to be a misprint, but we didn't use them just in case!! These are nice touches, but not when they come with a price tag - in a hotel of this price range we would expect that if such items are left in the room at all, then they are for the guest's use free of charge. * A note for anyone with reduced mobility:* The pool requires climbing a few steps to get in.

It was ours, we accidentally arrived a day early! This was not a problem & they showed us to our room. Firstly let me say, you will not be dissapointed with the appearance of this hotel, it looks exactly as it does on the website & is very well maintained - everything looks brand new. Our room looked onto the courtyard, the bed is elevated & super comfy, there is a big book for you to draw & scribble in & look at other peoples drawings & scribbles, they even supply a polaroid camera for which you can buy film (also in the room). A sink each, huge bath, separate toilet cubicle complete with disco ball light pully. It even has one of the 'libre' (free) signs from the Mexican taxi's in the window, which you flip down when you go out so they can come & clean your room. The roof terrace did not dissapoint, with the big round tanker/pool & the bar staff are lovely & the cocktails are fab & really not that expensive at all. They also do food, we had a few snacky things, which were delish.. They have a little area in the reception where they sell cool little bits & pieces. They are incredibly helpful here & for such a hip hotel, the staff are not pretentious or snotty in any way at all. They make an effort to remember who you are & one day when my partner went to the terrace without me, they asked where I was... This is quite a 'party' hotel, so if you want quiet early nights - forget it, lots of people seemed to be coming to the hotel in the evenings to go to the terrace to have cocktails & listen to the dj - who plays most nights, plays late.
