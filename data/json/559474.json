After staying in a wonderful hotel in Seattle, we were quite disappointed in this hotel, which was more expensive. While we loved the location and the customer service, the room left a lot to be desired. There was not enough counter space in the bathroom for my toiletries, so I had to keep them in the kitchen and walk back and forth. I'm quite surprised there have not been more complaints about the bed as I can't recall a worse sleeping situation at any hotel I've ever stayed at. At the very least, a hotel of this caliber should have comfortable mattresses and linens. Our balcony did not have a table and chairs. I couldn't get the heat to warm the room. The TV's are outdated and cheap. Valet service was great, but at $40 per day it should be. There is a fee for internet service and the wireless was USELESS in our room. We had breakfast at Fleuri -$18 for what most hotels call a \"Continental Breakfast\" (fruit, cereal, oatmeal, and pastries) seemed a little overpriced to me. Not sure why everyone loves this hotel...Definitely won't be staying there again.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "vancouver, bc", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME!!!\u201d", "Author": "bungadoo", "ReviewID": "UR124603099", "Content": "I stayed here recently with my two young children for my daughters 8th birthday.

Everyone was so friendly and welcoming from the doormen to the front desk staff to every employee we happened to come across in the hall, the elevator, wherever. All asked us how we were, how we were enjoying ourselves. Even if the room hadnt had been as fantastic as it was, the customer service puts this hotel right up at the top 5 best places Ive ever stayed. The icing on the cake, however, was when we received an unexpected knock at the door and the hotel had sent up chocolate covered strawberries and a happy birthday message for my little girl, compliments of the vice president! That really made her feel like a princess, and its the extra things like this that make a hotel fabulous.

We've been staying at the Sutton Place Hotel for many years and it is easy to say that this property never disappoints. Over the past couple of years, we have selected the residential tower known as La Grande Residence because of the convenience that comes with staying in a one-bedroom apartment that includes a full kitchen with dishes and utensils. If more room is needed, they also have two-bedroom apartments as well. And if that is not enough convenience, there is an urban chic IGA market right next door for all of your grocery needs. So La Grande Residence is a great choice whether you're staying for a couple of nights or a couple of weeks. In essence, your suite becomes a home-away-from-home complete with a wide-screen TV and a 5.1 surround-sound home theatre system. We've even bumped into a few celebrities over the years who stay in these suites while filming a movie in Vancouver. I do have one minor criticism, however, and it is that the beds are a wee bit too firm. The Sutton Place is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver. World-famous Robson Street with its endless shopping opportunities, restaurants, and coffee shops, is only steps away. In fact, there is a world of shopping and dining opportunities all within walking distance from the hotel. If that is not enough, the Scotiabank theatre, one of the nicest movie theatres in Vancouver, is right across the street. There are two places to dine within the hotel. Gerard Lounge is a great place to meet for a drink and a casual bite to eat. Gerard's martinis are fantastic and I would highly recommend them. The expresso martini complete with floating coffee beans is exceptional! The Fleuri Restaurant offers more formal dining , yet still remains west coast casual. We have come to enjoy their afternoon tea complete with scones, finger foods, and pastries. It's a great way to spend some quiet time together in relaxed, friendly surroundings. And on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, the Fleuri sets up their extravagant chocolate buffet during evening dining. Something you have to see to believe! The hotel has a wine store on site called The Wine Merchant. Their selection of wines is fantastic and you do not have to break the bank to buy a bottle from this store. Our purchase made us eligible for The Wine Merchant club card which can be used for discounts of up to 50% on food purchases in both eating establishments of the hotel. This is a great value, especially if you intend to visit the hotel again. All in all, this is a great place to stay in Vancouver. Oh, and don't forget to pick up a gourmet hot-dog on your way out the door as one of the best known vendors in the city, Jappadog, sets up nearby on the street corner of Burrard and Smithe.

In addition, the hotel does possess a very friendly and courteous hotel staff.

Last but not least, there is an IGA Supermarket located right next to the hotel. For those with infants or toddlers, if you need to buy groceries such as milk, fruits, diapers or even baby formulas, I would seriously consider staying at this hotel since all you you have to do is cross the side street from the hotel to get to there. One word of advice for those who is arriving in a car, I would recommend parking elsewhere since the hotel parking is very expensive compared to the other lots in the area. In short, if you do not care about how the hotel rooms looks as long as the hotel is centrally located, I would recommend this hotel to anyone since Hotwire offered such a good rate for this hotel. However, if you do care about how the room looks and feels, I would recommend staying at the some other hotels such as Fairmont Pacific Rim, Hotel Shangri-La or St Regis which are a lot more pricier, of course.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWow, awesome place to stay and we will be back\u201d", "Author": "smithsjr", "ReviewID": "UR114657823", "Content": "12 June 2011.

Our room was huge for a standard one bedroom, it really was huge, wonderfully presented, and it was comfortable, the bed was a huge king size, with crispy clean sheets and fluffy pillows. The balcony was so lovely to stand out on and have coffee even though the weather was rather unpleasant. We had dinner and breakfast in the dinning room and it was fantastic as was the service. The pool, gym, spa and laundry were all fantastic, we went home with clean clothes without having to look for a laundry mat or take home. We stay on the 8th Floor. It was ok.

The hotel is well located in downtown Vancouver. Anything and everything to do is within easy walking distance (try a Japadog from the stand out out in front of the hotel). Spectacular shopping is just around the corner. From the start, it was easy to see that my stay would be a pleasing one. The doorman, valet and bellman were attentive and very helpful. Check-in was an absolute breeze. Regrettably, a suit and a couple of dress shirts of mine did not travel well, and a quick phone call to the Valet brought quick attention. All items were expertly pressed and returned to me within a few hours. On Saturday, I sent a pair of shoes down for a quick polish and had them back within the hour. Thursday night (our first night), my father-in-law and I had a delightful dinner at Fleuri, the hotel restaurant. The waitstaff was excellent, and the food expertly prepared, not to mention delicious. The menu is intriguing and invites you to open your mind and palette to unique preparations. The service and menu are on par with some of the best restaurants at which I've dined, if not better. I followed with a couple of drinks at Gerard Lounge, where I found the bar staff to be an agreeable lot, eagerly helping the Canuck fans assuage their grief over an embarrassing showing against Chicago. We stayed in a two bedroom residence. The room was well appointed and had ample closet space. A small kitchenette was in the room, though we did not avail ourselves of it much. All of the necessary accoutrements are available for use. The beds are such that it's a toss-up between getting out of bed straightaway and seeing the city or tarrying awhile (which I did on Saturday morning) before starting your day. These racks are ideal for breakfast in bed. I cannot imagine wanting to stay anywhere else when i visit Vancouver. The hotel staff from housekeeping to management is first rate. It is readily apparent that they enjoy their jobs and take customer service seriously. I've stayed at upscale hotels comparable to The Sutton Place and been left wondering why I spent the extra money over a Holiday Inn; never so with The Sutton Place. My thanks and compliments to an extraordinary hotel! It is worth mentioning that The Sutton Place is an upscale hotel and as such is priced accordingly, but it was all money very well spent.", "Date": "April 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe most unbelievable level of service\u201d", "Author": "Auscaz", "ReviewID": "UR92622304", "Content": "We stayed at The Sutton Place Hotel (Grande Residences) for 5 nights between Xmas and New Year 2010. Everything about the place was outstanding - the location, the accommodation, the bar and restaurant and most of all the staff. We had a 1 bedroom deluxe apartment, and all-in-all it surpassed our expectations. We headed off to Whistler for 8 days and, as we were returning to Vancouver on the morning of the 8th of January, but only flying back to Australia at midnight that night, we decided to book a day room at Sutton Place, with the arrangement to vacate at 6pm. At 5.45pm, one of the people in our travelling party became ill enough that we needed to extend this time. After briefly explaining the situation to the front desk, we were told that we could have the room for as long as was necessary. The care and concern shown by the staff was unbelievable. They facilitated the calling of a doctor and offered assistance in getting to the hospital, phoning the room to see if a wheelchair was needed, an ambulance or taxi was required and generally if anything could be done. As people who are lucky enough to be reasonably frequent travellers and who have come to expect a certain standard of accommodation and service, we cannot recommend this place highly enough. We have stayed in a variety of hotels in Vancouver but would not stay anywhere else in future. If any staff of this hotel get to read these reviews, they may remember the events of that night. I say thank you from the bottom of the hearts of all of us who were there. As a point of interest, the other couple (with 2 young children) in our travelling party stayed in a one bedroom king suite, which was enormous and beautifully appointed. Their two young daughters slept on the foldout couch in the lounge and I believe they were very comfortable. We also had a family staying in a 2 bedroom apartment during the 5 days that we were there and who who were equally impressed.

All of the aforementioned really go a long way to making you almost overlook some of the shortcomings of the apartments...almost. The suite we had was spacious, nicely decorated, but the paint was peeling in the bathroom and baseboards, the cupboards in both the bathroom and kitchen were terribly dated, and the carpet was showing its age. The Sutton Place is also located close to a police station or fire station because we heard sirens late at night for the entire week of our stay. It blended into the background after the first night though but it was still somewhat annoying. But still, despite these flaws, you just can't help but love the place. From the moment you step through the doors, they treat you like important people. The service was beyond reproach, from the doorman to the concierge to the room service staff. Excellent people and worth a return visit all by itself. But add to that the great food from the restaurant and room service, the well-equipped gym and very nice swimming pool area, to the awesome location, La Grande Residence is a nice place for an extended visit in Vancouver.

The triple AAA rate seemed to be the best each time I checked but as the date came closer, the promotional rate turned out to be the best. I was looking for the one bedroom suite so I ended up booking in the grand residence tower. Wow, it was huge! It was a full one bedroom apartment with balcony, huge bedroom with king size bed (which was so comfortable!!!) galley kitchen with 4 full size appliances as well as blender, toaster, kettle and all the utensils/dishes/etc you need for entertaining! I was really impressed! There was a pullout couch in the living room as well as a huge flatscreen t.v with dvd and surround sound speakers! The patio had a bistro table and chairs which I used alot! I had a great view too from the 18th floor! There is an IGA market directly across the street for all of your grocery needs. There's a wine store attached to the hotel! I never ate in the restaurants but the room service was excellent everytime and served in style! Check in and check out was very quick and smooth. There was really only a couple of things that I was disappointed in: 1) when I booked on line, I was under the impression that my wireless internet ($15.00/day) would be included if I became a prestige member and booked on-line, it would also come with a $25.00 dining credit daily.(all of the promo rates come with this credit) I actually printed out the confirmation stating that it would be included. When I checked in they told me that with the promo rate that I received, wireless was not included but the $25.00 credit was. I tried to explain that it had nothing to do with the promo rate, that I received it for signing up as a member, but they would not budge. 2) Parking as everyone knows in Vancouver is very expensive, but when you are staying in a 5 star hotel, I expect the parking to be included! Sure if you want valet, that's different, but I thought $35.00/day was a little ridiculous. I would even consider $15.00 per day. They should just skip the dining credit and include parking and internet! There was also one day from about 4-7pm that there was no hot water. When I called, they blamed it on the city and told me I could go over to the \"hotel\" side and shower, well that's like walking across the street to another hotel, not very convenient at all. After a long discussion, and me cancelling my dinner reservations, I was able to get them to credit some of my charges for the inconvenience which was acceptable. Over all, I would give this hotel 5 out of 5 rating and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Loved it!

The La Grande Residence is a old Condo building next to the Sutton Place Hotel which they have purchased and use for longer term stays. The location is great, right off of Robson Street which is smack in the middle of downtown. The nice thing is that you get use of the pool and all of the other amenities of the hotel and yet get to have more space than your average hotel room. We had a two bedroom unit with one and a half baths (the half being off the master King bed suite). There is a full, but small kitchen, complete with pot/pan, dishes, oven, full sized fridge and dishwasher. This was great for cooking meals at \"home\" rather than needing to eat out every meal. There is also a grocery store just across the street. The rooms are not huge but don't feel small by any hotel standards. It is also nice to have a living room with large flat screen TV, sofa bed, and a dinning table for four. There is a small balcony which we didn't use since it was snowing. The unit, since it use to be a condo also has more than enough closet space. The furniture and decor were nice. Not five star by any means, but nothing seemed over worn and we felt like we could relax in the room for the night without feeling trapped in a hotel room. The service seemed great. We had a quick check in and the doormen always were very polite with smiles on their faces. The central location made it an easy walk to anywhere in downtown. It was about a 30 minute walk to Stanley Park and even shorter down to the area were the new Olympic Park is starting to be built. Anyone traveling with more that two people or looking for more than just your standard hotel room, I would recommend you check out this place. It is nice to have the extra space, especially if it is in the winter months when it is cold and gets dark early.", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alberta, Canada", "Title": "\u201cEverything was terrible\u201d", "Author": "Cindy12388", "ReviewID": "UR18932104", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here with our two toddlers in a two bedroom unit. I rely faithfully on Tripadvisor but unfortunately there was nothing written when I booked. Our unit was absolutely filthy (the kitchen sink sponge had dirt and food and hair crusted into it; the cabinets had food and dirt stuck to them, the carpets and upholstery were visibly dirty and so greasy and disgusting to touch we could not walk without shoes or sit without putting a sheet over the furniture), the switch plates and some baseboards were broken, the walls in dire need of paint or at least a good hosing down. The bathroom was so small that housekeeping puts the towels in the bedroom as there is neither enough rack or counter space to keep them in the bathroom, the furniture was mismatched and really tacky, the air conditioner and open electrical panel is in the walk in closet (really just a utility closet with two wire racks to hang clothes) and it is so loud that we couldn't stand to have it on while we were in the room, nevermind on the balcony where the exterior portion of the unit sits . We unfortunately had to put our kids down for a nap immediately and could not request another room right away. As soon as possible I went to the front desk and described the room to the clerk; I told her that I assumed this room was an aberration that simply had not been updated when the rest of the hotel was built or renovated. She assured me that all the rooms were identical except that if I wanted I could pay to upgrade to a 2 bedroom penthouse unit. A really nice bellman took me up, and I have to say that it wasn't much better. The appliances were stainless steel and overall the unit had less dirt but I would never describe it as clean. I told him I'd talk it over with my husband, and while doing so I received a call from the front desk manager who said she'd been told about my concerns and we accepted her offer to upgrade us to the penthouse unit free of charge. I have to say this was extremely good service as I'd never even asked to speak with management. At 1:00 a.m. there was a huge crowd of people yelling and smoking in the hallway for so long we finally called the front desk, and we were told that we were not the first people to call and complain and they would have security attend. A while later security showed up and asked them to quiet down a bit, but the crowd noise and smoke continued in the hall until we phoned a second and third time. In all, we lost about 2 hours sleep and our children were half scared out of their minds. The hotel dealt with this very, very poorly.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "La Grande Residence at the Sutton Place Hotel Vancouver", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d559474-Reviews-La_Grande_Residence_at_the_Sutton_Place_Hotel_Vancouver-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$216 - $425*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">845 Burrard St</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">at the Sutton Place Hotel</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Vancouver</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">British Columbia</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">V6Z 2K6</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "559474", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/8b/c3/8bc3328c742e2107a7c855a7fca50a953large.jpg"}}
