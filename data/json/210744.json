I found the Admiral to be very good value. It is just a few minutes from Paddington Station and the fact that the hotel is located on a pedestrian frontage away from the main road means that it enjoys a quiet location and gets little street noise. The manager of both hotels, Mr Kin is excellent. He is friendly, welcoming, professional and very helpful and deserves all possible accolades for the charming way that he manages a busy hotel operation split across multiple buildings. He is an enormous asset to the business and a consummate hotel professional. He is the star of these businesses. The Admiral's rooms are very clean, tastefully decorated, modern facilities and are of a very acceptable standard. The ground floor bar and breakfast area would not be out of place in a boutique hotel that could easily charge x 2 times the price. The design concept of the area is very good and the breakfast service itself was perfect. The one draw-back is that the Admiral does not have a lift and the upper stair floors are a bit narrow which would be difficult for guests with challenges or heavy luggage. That said, the main reception at Kingsway has a large storage area and welcome lounge with comfy couches and travellers could easily leave their main luggage there so that they did not have to take heavy luggage to the upper floors. In summary the location and management is excellent and this hotel offers very good value for money. Over 20+ years I have been coming for short stays to London and the Admiral is one of the best places I have seen recently and with the care taken by its manager Mr. Kin I would certainly be persuaded to stay there again soon.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAwful.

When we arrived the Hotel Manger Kim said it was over booked and did nt have our triple room and could offer us 2 doubles and a single in the hotel down the road, no apology was given and I found him the most un helpful person I have ever come across. He blamed the over booking on Booking.Com, even though he had our booking a long time prior to arrival. The single room was no bigger than a shoe box and smelt terribly of damp, so as you can imagine it was a very uncomfortable stay for that poor guest. My room was on the top floor again it smelt and was extremely hot. We stayed for 2 nights and every time we returned to the room the card swipe key didnt work and we had to walk back down 4 flights of stairs to the reception for them to re activate it. The bathroom was filthy the door was hanging off its hinges. At breakfast we were told to go to the hotel a few doors up and then were promptly returned to our hotel. The man working in the breakfast room had the worst body odour I have ever smelt, all in all we were very disapointed. When we checked out we were told the card machine wasnt working and we had to go to the cashpoint, strangley enough when we returned it was working again !! When we told the manager of our miserable stay he didnt apologise once instead he said we shouldnt of booked through booking.com. The reason for the over booking was because a guest had to stay on longer as one of their party was taken to hospital which of course was fair enough, however the attitude of 'Kim' was well it isnt my fault I have 200 guests to keep happy, To be honest a sorry and a smile would have been enough.

It was my birthday so we wanted a nice weekend away in London, something basic, not too far away from the main attractions and not too expensive. The hotel we booked was called the Admiral Hotel. It says on the website that you have to check in at the Kingsway Park hotel, which was situted a few steps away. This was fine. The Admiral looked nice on the website pictures, showing a nice modern bar, and clean rooms. It was this hotel we had booked! Once into the Kingsway Park hotel, we where then told thats where we would be staying. It seems that's where everyone stays! It appeared the nice clean Admiral Hotel was not having guests! This was indeed empty! We checked in early, and where told where our rooms where. As other reviews say, the stairs where very steep and there was no lift or warning which didnt help someone in my party that had a knee complaint, but i havent let that interfere with the review, as i could of enquired upon booking. My room had a terrible smell as soon as i walked in. I wasnt expecting anything less though, as the hotel upon entry was tired, shabby, had a smell to it, and had dirty woodwork and walls, and frayed carpets. The divan bed was 2 singles together, with a badly stained base. The lamps had stained and burnt lampshades. The furniture was dated and didnt fit in the room. There was no fancy chairs and furniture like the i've just seen on the Kingsway Park Hotel website! We kepting hurting ourselves when walking around the crammed room on the furniture. The portable tv did work, but the picture wasnt quite viewable, i felt like i had double vision after looking at it. The main critisim is aimed at the toilet which was a portocabin shower and loo in one type of thing, which was placed in the room, but then was incorporated into the paintwork. It smelt, had mould on the shower, and when sitting on the loo, your foot was in the shower area, which was very small. The bottom of the door was also covered in rust. I did not use the shower at all, as it was very off putting. My partner did, and he was fine with it. The other room we booked, for other parties, was very similar but they had a bath, and a more normal bathroom, which had a terrible smell of damp in it. I didnt sleep well during my two night stay. The bedding was a sheet, and then an extremely 'itchy' blanket, with a floral throw over the top. This was covered in stains. Me and my partner had one small pillow each, there was no other bedding to use. Breakfast was included in the price described as a 'full english' we went down for breakfast which was served in small room crammed with tables in the basement. Two ladies, whom we saw cleaning rooms served breakfast. The option was cereal, toast and the cooked breakfast was a boiled slice of bacon, egg (scrambled,fried or boiled) plum tomato and a sausage. I did not recieve what i ordered for breakfast on both mornings, and didnt rectify it as the person serving breakfast could not fully understand my english. Our bed was made while we where out, and there where towels left in the room. The manager/owner was around for most of the time, and there seemed to be approx 6-7 other guest there, excluding my party. There was no problem returning. The front door was unlocked and there was a gentleman on the desk. The latest we returned was around 11pm. The area of this hotel sussex gardens, has a whole host of hotels similar to this one. They all had vacancies in there window, but did look a lot cleaner and friendlier. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. It did us for the weekend, because we had no choice once we got there. Location was great for us, lots of restuarants, and paddington station near by, but for the price, which can seem cheap, im sure there are others for the same price in better condition. In my opinion, it wasnt clean, wasnt comfortable, the food wasnt good, so it was a huge let down for me. Luckily the great company i had, and London being so fantastic didnt make my weekend a complete let down. I have written this review within 7 hours of returning as i would hate anyone to have a weekend ruined, and this hotel would do that! Don't be fooled thinking they put you up in the Admiral hotel, when infact your staying at the Kingsway Park. The website for the Kingsway Park Hotel says it has recently been refurbished! Id of hated to of seen what it was like before! Both the Kingsway Park and The Admiral Hotel have individual websites, the pictures on both are extremely different to what you get, so there not worth looking at!

The shower head could not fit in the bracket in any way but to point directly at the opposite wall rather than downwards.

This is not an AA *** Hotel.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cScary\u201d", "Author": "heather75b", "ReviewID": "UR5958412", "Content": "Scary hotel. My room was in the basement and it felt like I was in the cabin of a very small boat. There was a weird skylight/ceiling hatch that let a small amount of light in. There was a ceiling fan that made so much noise you would think it was nuclear-powered. And at night lying in the bed - it almost felt like you were being buried alive.

We originally had booked two doubles and a single, but when we saw the rooms, we changed to a double and a triple. The single we were shown was in the basement down a small, twisty staircase . It was a tiny, dark room with an even tinier shower stall/WC and none of us wanted it. So two people ended up in room 3, and three of us ended up in room 9. Room 3 wasn't bad. It was the easiest room in the hotel to reach: it was up the first flight of stairs: a straight shot. The room had cross ventilation, and a decent sized shower stall/WC. Room 9 was up a floor or two more and you had to go around corners/landings. 9 did not have cross ventilation, and it was hot! The bathroom was very small, probably like what you would find in a recreational vehicle or a boat. I've included a photo of the bathroom in room 9. Both 3 and 9 looked out the back of the building, really not much of a view, but probably quieter than if we had been fronting Sussex Gardens. The staff was nice, and the breakfasts were fine. The rooms were acceptably clean. The staff did help us bring our bags up when we arrived. You still have to check in with the hotel 2 doors down (same management/ownership.) One possible problem in the future: apparently they have applied to have a bar/club in the evenings on the ground floor. I got the feeling it might be open to the public, not just the people staying there. Not sure how that will work out as far as noise, and security.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Angel, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cNot at all as advertised\u201d", "Author": "jgl1", "ReviewID": "UR5785779", "Content": "The Admiral hotel at 139 Sussex Gardens is desribed by Orbitz when I booked as \"a dedicated staff providing an exceptionally welcoming and friendly atmosphere.
