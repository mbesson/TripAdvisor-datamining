Arriving really late, i had no opportunity to change my reservations in case of, and since this was listed with a East Hotel group, I tought i would be alright without checking the place. Well, i should have. This pace was a real dump. Badly organised, with a surge of 3 check-in and all wheels were spinning without traction. I had to take a smoking room, as none other were available. The staff was nice but blas\u00e9, and the general impression was the place was dirty. It unfortunately got massively confirmed when i entered the room. The smell of mould from the bathroom was perceptible, even with the Aircon working at the entrance. The bathroom was really neglected and between pubic hair or dust, i found a crust of mould on the window and the wall! Enough to cover all the edges of the windows ledge. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable, and the TV was from the 90's. No channels, menu or instructions even. It felt like a student room from a cheap university. The carpet was new in the hallway and the floor i was at, but the carpet inside my room was from the late 90's. I went for Breakfast in the morning and experienced a relative average service, with this feeling of having some form of service. I guess, rather than infrasturcture, it is always easier to throw legions of cheap staff to give you an average service, than fixing the problems at the core. I checked out and ran away for meetings, wondering why so many people were gathered in the lobby. Than i saw the tour guide and realised why it was on the cheap side. A famous english tour operator (this one being the indian franchise) was obvisouly feeding the hotel with loads of tourists on the cheap angle. I won't go back there, unless i am stuck again and can't find a room in town. It hopefully will go better for them, as i am afraid they will close if it carries on like that.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cHad low expectations and these were not even met!\u201d", "Author": "farmerbels", "ReviewID": "UR124659645", "Content": "Has recently rebranded itself as East Village Hotel however there have been no renovations to the hotel itself.

I'm a down to earth person (still got my farm girl roots firmly at heart) and isn't hard to please me but just nothing went right with this stay. Their Amex was broken (had been for some time), the lift was broken (one was working), the key cards didn't work with the door (took two trips back downstairs to sort it), the bathroom was filthy with pubic hairs abound, one of the two 'usable' plugs was hanging down by it's wires, no mini bar, no manuals with hotel facilities - explaining emergency procedures, dining options, room service etc. No iron or ironing board. A tv out of the 90's which had a grainy and unclear picture on the one english show (although there was a CNN & sports channel), and the internet plug I eventually found when I pulled out the luggage rack and found it under the fallen tea bags hidden by the carpet. I did go to check out the pool (access via the \"cafe!!\" with filthy floors) but was smothered in blue smoke from the construction next door so went back inside pretty promptly. The hotel was fairly empty apart from a bus load of partying Mainlanders who had fun and smoked in the corridors until all hours. All in all a pretty miserable experience and I decided to forgo my free breakfast to check out as early as possible and grab a coffee across the road at Starbucks!!!

There were 3 elevators but only 2 were working. Buttons in the elevators were cracking. We needed to push the security card into the reader real slow before the elevator is able to recognize the card. Elevators are small and if there are tour groups, you can end up waiting quite a bit for the elevators. We got a room on the 12F, a non-smoking floor. However, it smelled bad upon entering the room. Not sure which is worse - a foul smelling room or a smoking room. However, on the plus side, the room was not too bad i.e. rather spacious, relatively comfortable and surroundings were not noisy. However, bathroom had no ventilation so it fogged up real quick. Other items in the room were dated e.g. buttons for the air-conditioning, the music and the lights. The area around the hotel was also dodgy. The hotel is has an adjoining shopping mall that comprises mostly drinking holes but I do not mean your respectable pubs. You cannot see what is going on from the outside of these drinking hotels and there are men standing by the doors - usually a sign that other than alcohol, there are other types of activities going on. Hard to explain if you have family or kids in tow. If you are driving, do be very careful coming down the steep driveway. The end of the steep slope that joins the carpark can damage your car if you are not careful. Having said the above, I will give it points for location (it is about 10 to 15 mins from the airport), and worth considering if you need a reasonably priced hotel but do not need to be in the city. There are many good local eateries around the hotel and a good shopping mall across the road.

There are some minor points like the TVs which are quite old, but not big issues at all. Negatives: For the money they charge (approx 175SGD + taxes), they can provide free WiFi or breakfast. 15 SGD for that breakfast is a bit overpriced for the food being supplied. TV itself seemed very old. But don't have much to complain apart from the crappy live bands / sick bar girls in the basement forcing and dragging people to drink with them. The basement resembles a Red Light Area. To avoid this, don't use the rear entrance of the hotel..

Bed was big and reasonably clean but i felt like it made me really itchy. Bathroom was not very clean. Service was fair but not very friendly or welcoming. Not a great start to the holiday. On the way back through Singapore we stayed at Hotel Madras which was half the price and much nicer and better location to shops, train station and only marginally more in a taxi.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wigan", "Title": "\u201cBest Avoided\u201d", "Author": "Parky14", "ReviewID": "UR51104792", "Content": "Our holiday consisted of 2 nights in Singapore and then onto Thailand. When Singapore airlines cancelled our flight home, they offered us two nights hotel accommodation in Singapore until the next flight home, which we accepted. The hotel is not in a good location; it is half way between the airport and the city centre. There is no MRT within walking distance and the taxi prices vary between \u00a36 and \u00a39 (one way into the centre) dependant on the driver. We then sussed out how to use the buses - there is a stop right outside the hotel and they are really easy to use. The bus stop shows where the buses go to and each stop has a stage number. When you get on the bus, pick up a leaftet which tells you the number of every stop. There is a machine on the bus which tells you the number of each stop when you get to it, so you know which number stop to get off at. The buses are very cheap and air-conditioned. The hotel itself is very old-fashioned. When we arrived late at night we were told we had been upgraded to an executive room. The room was very large, but all the furnishings were totally worn out - the chair was literally thread-bare and the room stank of smoke. (We are non-smokers and we were not asked if we wanted smoking or non-smoking). We would have asked to move rooms, if it weren't so late in the night. We went out looking for somewhere to eat, but due to time everywhere seemed shut (we did go out the wrong way, which we found out later!) so we decided to go back and order room service. The food was absolutely disgusting and we should really have refused to pay for it and complained, but again, as it was so late we just wanted to go to sleep. The hotel's location is pretty weird. If you venture out of the hotel you end up in a kind of shopping centre precinct, which is full of blacked-out bars. On the second day of our trip, we checked out of our room, but was only being picked up for the airport later, so we put some clothes in our bags to change into. When we got back to the hotel and asked the concierge where the hotel toilets were to get changed, we were informed they were throught the door into the precinct. This was approx 7pm in the evening. You had to pay the woman outside to use the toilets. All the bars are blasting out music and the toilets, which were like un-maintained public toilets were full of scantily-clad women who were using the bars. There was no loo roll and the floors were wet. This was where I had to get changed for the airport. I cannot comment on what happens in the bars, but I did feel that there was a very seedy atmosphere. We couldn't complain, as we had got the accommodation for free, but if you are in the same position and are offered this hotel, I would ask if you could pay towards upgrading to a better hotel in a nicer location.", "Date": "December 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland Central, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201coutdated & remote\u201d", "Author": "Roachnkane", "ReviewID": "UR46712265", "Content": "This hotel was booked by travel agent for us and it was not quite what we were expecting.

I was on the 7th Floor so had no problem with noise but i thought the area was quiet, even with Katong Village out the back. Perhaps this 7th floor has been redecorated because it seemed perfectly fine decor and clean to me. I heard rumours about the working girls in the bars nearby but you have to go right around the back of the hotel to access these (no, I did not go! :-) ) and all the lifts have new key card entry so there was no unwanted persons on your floors. I think an unstated plus about the Paramount is it is pretty central to the airport and to the town. A taxi to the quays or Orchard Road is only S$15 max and you have great shopping Mall (Parkway parade) opposite. And for those of you with an ounce of get up and go you are 5-7 minutes walk to East Coast park (go through the mall and take the underpass behind - perfectly safe in Singapore) and you have a long coast of activity, beach (albeit narrow), roller blading, a surfing lake (puled by those automatic rope thingies) and a great pint at Scruffy Murphys pub, together with a Fish food restaurant complex and cheaper hawker stalls a little farther up. Hasn't got the attraction of a lovely city hotel but hasn't got the huge pricing either. I would not say i would recommend it but would not balk at going back but I also would not book it for alonger stay, maybe 3-5 days max and use it as a cheap hub.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cAwful ...really is..\u201d", "Author": "JasShanghai", "ReviewID": "UR20184025", "Content": "My clients, who will remain anonymous, always books me into this hotel as considered cheap so I have stayed 4 times. The hotel is awful rooms are dirty and smell unbearable. In 2007 room I had there were 100's of small bugs crawling over the wall behind the bed so had to move bed away. The bathrooms are in awful state. The breakfast is really a joke, you best save your money and eat out many nice food places about round in that area. For the money (I paid around \u00a380/night) you could stay off Orchard Road as I have a number of times before and hotels are cleaner and up to date. I was told in 2007 this place was going to be knocked down so was disappointed to find myself booked back in for 2008 (' ';) so I hope the bulldozer gets to it before I do for 2009. Staffs are pleasant enough but just staying in bad hotel spoils the beauty of Singapore so be warned. Downstairs is the sleazy side of Singapore numerous bars and scantly clad females wondering about. If you decide to pop across the road and down Joo Chiat Road you can get more than just an eye full there's hundreds of them. The girls do not approach you or give you hassle so isn't bad as other countries where young ladies make a living off the streets. It\u2019s safe and in a way amusing but is not place for families.

Usually I stay in town, but for some reason it was not possible to get rooms. An agent booked the room for me. The hotel is quite OK allthough on the average side, and rooms appear a bit worn down. I had a room at the end of the corridor and did not experience any noise from elevators, but in the mornings when I worked in room quite a lot of chit-chat from staff who had their breaks just outside my door. The amenities in room are sufficient, as well as bathroom functions are OK, - but appear very old and in need of upgrade. Beds are quite hard, but still you get a good sleep in absolutely clean and spotless sheets. The room had a fridge of mini-bar type but with no drinks. Acceptable for me as there is plenty shopping nearby to get cheaper drinks than a minibar normally offers. Below the hotel there is a shopping arcade, or used to be, as now converted to a \"bar street\" open from 5pm to 1am. Generally this is no disturbance to the hotel, but if you pass as a male to get to the street late afternoon or at night, you have to pass a minefield of loose girls trying to shanghai you into the bars. Some night you could hear a bit of music from these bars, as my room was in that end of hotel, but just after midnight all quiet. In general I felt the hotel to be good value for money as I had a corporate rate from my agent, but counting 2 return trips a day to town by taxi, the cost will match a much better hotel in town. I used the busses frequently as at least two routes serves Chinatown where I like to eat, shop, etc. Internet in room was superb, but expensive compared to room rate. The hotel has several restaurants and conference facilities. I only had the buffet breakfast some days, and it was OK, - no more. Coffee tends to be topped up with hot water as time passes, - quite good if you come early but very thin just before closing time. I would not stay in this hotel again unless difficult to book in town, - due to the location rather than the hotel standard which generally is OK.", "Date": "November 24, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Paramount Hotel Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d305546-Reviews-Paramount_Hotel_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">25 Marine Parade Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">449536</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "305546", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0a/35/0a35118eff067fb210a1bf0627e530f53large.jpg"}}
