I arrived at the hotel just before midnight (which was extremely difficult to find despite my printing out the route on google maps before hand). The man at the desk began by saying that there was a problem with my room, that the shower had broken and that there was water everywhere. He continued by saying that he had a friend who had a hotel down the road, and that I would be staying there instead (which he phrased as a statement not as a request). Obviously I have no proof as to whether this was true or not, but I get the feeling that they had overbooked and had simply decided to move me at their convenience. He showed me a handwritten list of guests and their associated room numbers, to which he said \"The whole floor is flooded\" yet I noticed that it was only my name that had another hotel allocated to it. He said to me that if I had a problem with it, I could come back the next morning and talk to the manager as he was only the night watchman. His \"friend\" then appeared at the door and told me that he would take me to the second hotel. As a young female solo traveller, the idea of following a complete stranger through the deserted streets of an unknown city in the dead of the night, didn't particularly appeal to me, but Tintoretto didn't really give me any choice. The new hotel was adequate and that was it. I had paid 90\u00e2\u201a\u00ac in advance for Tintoretto and the new hotel definately wasn't worth this. Although I could have returned the next morning to complain to the manager, as I only had 2 days in Venice, I was not particularly eager to waste half my morning arguing with hotel staff nor spending the rest of the morning moving hotels.

After panicking a fair bit and going through all our stuff several times, I made phone calls back to England and my friends tried to help us by finding out how we should proceed without passports. Eventually I advised the hotel staff that our passports had been stolen. They gestured towards their pigeon holes behind the desk and nodded. After asking why they had them and who had taken them they gave me no answers. I had no idea when someone had gone into the room and taken them - whowever had done it would have had to go through my bags thoroughly and open zips etc to find them. I was offered no explanation or apology. Furthermore, the pigeonholes were on view and accessible to all who entered the unlocked hotel door and the desk was often unstaffed so anyone could take the passports etcetera. Good points??, this hotel provides a cooler , if cramped, room in really hot weather and it is not too far from the water bus. You can also get a really bad breakfast in with the price- everything tasted of cardboard, including the dryer than dry croissants. There is fruit salad available- if you like it fresh from the tin.

I was shocked to find that this Exclusive Hotel was ever considered an option for any of our clients or our staff as well. We had a charming greeting from a very friendly manager behind the desk.

He escorted us across the alley away from the main hotel to a narrow corridor to enter another part of the hotel. Not unusual.

Having read an earlier comment on TripAdvisor and pondered the thought of a hotel selling itself on the fact it was remodelled almost a decade ago, we were bracing ourselves. But we'd got a great deal for a last minute booking, and it was only for two nights, so what the heck! But we need not have worried. We found the hotel without too much trouble, and check in was smooth and effecient in the cramped reception area. Staff were friendly, helpful, and of course spoke excellent English. The first surprise was being shown to our room by being taken back outside the hotel, across the square, and down a dubious looking narrow alleyway behind a kebab shop! However, once inside the decor was modern and fresh. Our room, judging by the floor plan, was the largest one of the five in the annex. In fact it could have slept five (as in addition to the double bed there was a fold-out double and single bed in the room). The bathroom was clean and modern, although the shower took a little while to get hot. We got the impression that this annex might be a new addition to the hotel. We thought it a nice touch that the hotel had provided umberellas in a stand by the door for use of guests getting to and from the main hotel building in the event of a downpour. If we had a negative point to make it was about breakfast itself. The dining room was miniscule, with a two foot square area that contained croissants, jams, cereals, etc that you were invited to help yourself to - which would have been interesting had there been more than six people in the dining room! It wasn't the best quality breakfast we've had on our travels. That aside, the hotel was in a central location and easy to walk to from the bus station. Venice itself is a terrific place to visit and we had a wonderful time.", "Date": "May 11, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201ctintoretto no masterpiece\u201d", "Author": "blondie1344", "ReviewID": "UR1132957", "Content": "This is a small hotel in a good location of Venice. The staff is friendly and polite. The public rooms (lobby and breakfast rooms are attractive). There is no elevator, so be prepared to haul you luggage several flights. Although the rooms were supposedly remodeled in 1995, we found our two rooms to be unattractive. The rooms were cramped and cheaply furnished. The carpeting was stained, threadbare, and moldy. Hot water was tepid at best. Although we had planned to stay 4 nights, we left after the fourth because of the above problems. The management insisted on charging us for one extra night, which I have never encountered elsewhere. Even though Venice hotels are notoriously costly and small, I think one can do better.", "Date": "July 9, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Tintoretto", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d234376-Reviews-Hotel_Tintoretto-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$168 - $290*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Cannaregio Santa Fosca 2316</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30121</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "234376", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/60/f6/60f6bc5b41e59cf460c9c2efdb1a7d446large.jpg"}}
