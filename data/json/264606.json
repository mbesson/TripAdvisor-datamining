Construction work on street, underground being built, so dont expect it to be quiet dring working hours. room was small but spotless, sheets were pretty worn, one had holes in it and also two of the towels, this is not good enough as we were payin 65.00eur pps per night B&B. I did not complain, as i think they should know themselves without it having to be pointed out, a hole is a hole at the end of the day, you wouldnt have it at home and as i was so tierd when i arrived i couldnt be bothered.

The room was very small but spotless, it was cleaned every day. The bedding was a little worn but it didn't take away from the comfortable beds - really soft. It had 2 single beds pushed together, unfortunately, at the head of the bed was a BIG wooden \"rafter beam\" right in between them which we smacked our heads off a few times... not the best! There was a safe (at no extra charge) a small wardrobe and a desk/chair. There was a 22\" LCD TV with BBC1 and a music channel but no other English speaking channels. Checkout is between 7 & 11am but they are happy to keep your bags for you and reception will happily book you a taxi if you need one for the airport etc.. You could hear other holiday makers in the rooms above / beside you - but it wasn't enough to put us off the hotel. Bathroom - Bathroom was small but functional, it was basically a \"wet room\", unfortunately... this ALSO had the ever present rafter beams inside the showers which (if you are over 5 foot 6) you'd smack your head off too! :-/ , the water pressure was good even at times when there was high usage. There was a hair dryer and 2 bath & 2 hand towels. There was also complimentary shampoo, shower gel, and soap. There is a lift, it goes from the ground floor to the 3rd floor. So.. if you are on the 4th floor and when going to/from breakfast in the basement, you need to go up and down a flight of steep stairs. The staff were all really friendly and happy to help with any queries / directions etc. Reception is 24 hours. Breakfast was really nice - offering bacon and eggs, cheeses and cold meats etc, There was toast, pancakes cereals - basically what you'd expect from a continental hotel. WIFI - there was access to free WIFI from anywhere in the hotel giving really good coverage. There was also the use of a PC in main reception too if you wanted it at no extra charge. Location - About 2 minutes walk from Dam square and about 10 from the red light district, about 15 minutes walk from Central station. Walking in the other direction, you are about 10 minutes from Rembrandt square too - The hotel is in a great location, right in the middle of things without being in your face. There was lots of noise from the digging/drilling outside the hotel early in the morning, where they are building a subway, it wasn't as bad as you'd think to be honest but not likely to be finished till 2015 ish. It wouldn't put me off staying here. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would likely use it again.

We picked the backside, so we would not have noise from the front (although I think there's not a lot of noise, since it's not directly next to the main road). The room was very nice and it was what I expected after seeing the photo's on other websites. My preference for 2 separate beds was honored. The only thing I found weird was that there was no garbage can in the room itself (there was a very small one in the bathroom). I didn't bother to ask the staff for this, since it didn't bother me that much. We had 2 laptops with us and you can get free access to the internet in your room. Only thing \"missing\" was an outlet to charge our laptops (we had to disconnect a light next to our bed, the only free outlet was next to the door, too far from where we used our laptops). The beds were comfortable enough to get a good night's rest, the room was clean and housekeeping wasn't overly annoying in the morning. Maybe the hotel could supply \"DND\" signs though.

Well, you could see the sky if you looked up. The room itself was tiny - I had to keep moving a chair around because it either blocked the closet or the pathway to the door. No individual controls of the lights - if you wanted to just read in bed you had to do so with all of the lights on in the room. The bed was ok, although a bit soft. Breakfast was your typical Euro-buffet, except that the sterno had gone out and the eggs & bacon got cold. The \"waitress\" didn't monitor it, and when I brought it to her attention she fixed me some fresh eggs - scorched - and microwaved the bacon that'd gotten cold - tasted like rubber.

One of my friends who had the single room was on the very top floor, even further up than where the lift goes. He was in the roof part and the eves were quite Claustrophobic. This was a very small room!! The breakfast was a buffet and was great! Overall this is a good hotel with helpful staff.", "Date": "September 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNew improved Rokin?\u201d", "Author": "kmherself", "ReviewID": "UR3839179", "Content": "First stayed here some time ago, and hotel is now better since refurbishment - nice to have a lift after staying in Amsterdam hotels without one! Reasonably priced for its very convenient and central location. Breakfast was excellent and rooms clean. Only problem we had was with the location of our room - we were given room 6 on our first night, and this room is almost subterranean, with the only natural light coming in through a skylight! Perhaps after the refurb they are now using spaces which elsewhere would be storage or kitchen space, rather than accommodation. After complaining, we were moved to a room with a window, which was a huge improvement. Would happily recommend overall, but perhaps those booking online as we did should check they are getting a room with a window.", "Date": "September 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cGood facilities, awful unhelpful rude staff\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2853075", "Content": "Hotel Rokin is centrally located...but the construction out the front which will continue well in to 2005 means it is very inconvenient to get to and from. The hotel facilities are great...but they are overshadowed by the staff who are incredibly unhelpful and unwelcoming. My friend checking in one day before me meant that I was made to wait an unacceptable amount of time before I was admitted entrance to the room that had been booked in my name. An original request for a twin room was ignored and we were given a double. A further request to rectify this was deemed too hard and inconvenient and postponed until the following day. Despite being promised a change of room, I had to call and organise it again with a different member of staff. Simple things like handing over keys became a chore when faced with the sour, dour and rude nature of the staff. The hotel enforced a 'visitors policy' so visitors were only allowed in hotel rooms for 1 hour. This was subsequently changed by another member of staff and we were told that visitors were not allowed at all. I was accused of trying to 'smuggle' people in to my room, and of 'hiding' people in there when in reality, I was in there alone. All in all, the hotel itself is let down by its staff. I have never stayed in a hotel like it - where the staff seem to go out of their way to make your stay unpleasant as possible.

Nice room with en-suite shower room, really clean and a better breakfast in the new lower ground floor breakfast room. Staff were all very friendly, we have stayed here before the renovations and it was a bit rough around the edges, however now that everything has been refurbished I would certainly recommend it for location/comfort, average price (not as cheap as it was), and decent breakfast! We shall stay here again on our next visit, we will try for rooms at the rear of the building though as the front is quite noisy with the building of the underground link past the front of the building which has been going on for at least 18months now, and the trams/traffic going past till the early hours...
