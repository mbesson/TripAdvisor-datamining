It was good value for what we paid. The staff at the reception desk were always courteous, friendly and helpful. We arrived about 12 and although check-in wasn't until 3, we were given our room straightaway. The room and bathroom were clean, modern and standard sized for a purpose built European hotel. We got vouchers at reception that allowed you to use free wifi within our room. We also got a voucher from reception for 15 mins Internet from their on site terminals to print boarding passes. The location is about 5 mins away from the nearest u & s bahn station and there is a bus stop outside, so we used public transport most of the weekend, although taxis are pretty cheap for short journeys in Berlin too. The breakfast was good, there were empty cleaned tables when you arrived and a good selection of foods that were replaced right up until the time that the breakfast finished.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "BH/MG/Brasil", "Title": "\u201cNice place\u201d", "Author": "DUDU-BH", "ReviewID": "UR118102863", "Content": "A good hotel with a good location.

Sure, this is no Waldorf or W Hotel, but for the money you pay I believe it is excellent value. We arrived early on a Friday morning half-expecting to be told that check-in was at 3pm and that we would have to store our luggage. However, we were greeted with a warm smile and with the news that our room was indeed ready. The room was not the biggest in the world, but again for the price we paid, it did the job. I liked the decor of the room - black, white and green, and loved the black slate in the bathroom. With regards to its location, it is a 10 minute walk to Checkpoint Charlie as well as to Potsdamer Platz. One tip - when you land in Berlin, get yourself the \"Berlin Card\" for a few days - this will give you full access to the public transport and although the nearest U-Bahn (M\u00f6ckernbr\u00fccke) is a good 5 minutes walk away, the number M41 bus stops outside the hotel and runs right past Potsdamer Platz and on to the main railway station (Berliner Hauptbahnhof or Hbf for short). However, on both the Saturday and Sunday, we chose to hire bikes from the NH hotel, which was a complete boon. In exchange for \u20ac12 each for 24 hours, we had great bikes complete with locks and went on a big bike ride around the capital. Berlin has great cycle paths, so it is child's play to get about. Internet access at the hotel is the only downside. You can get 5 minutes worth for free, but only if you use one of the two terminals next to reception. Otherwise you have to pay if you want wifi in your room, and it isn't the cheapest. There is no mini-bar, but instead there is a vending machine next to the elevators on the ground floor. I am told breakfast is good at the hotel, but on both occasions we had had late nights, so missed it. But not to worry. If you exit the hotel, turn right and walk 100 metres, there is a cool bistro/caf\u00e9 on your right which does one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in Germany (and boy, can they do nice breakfasts!). Plus, it serves brekkie until 4pm. Great! Overall, the hotel is clean, super efficient and does its job well. Staff are friendly and willing to help you out with anything you need or want to know. Again, it's not the Raffles nor the Beverly Hills hotel, but if you are looking for smart, inexpensive accommodation for a weekend trip to the German capital, you could do much worse than this great little find.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Erfurt", "Title": "\u201cStylish, new but poor beds\u201d", "Author": "Sonnenschein74", "ReviewID": "UR81695595", "Content": "The hotel is situated in a quieter part of Berlin but close to the city center (25 min walking distance to Brandenburg Gate and 10 min to Potsdamer Platz).
