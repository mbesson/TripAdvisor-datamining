In NOLA . . . . It said a \"non-smoking room, king size bed, ac, and free breakfast\" we aren't snobs or rich by any means so we booked it. When we got there Hurricane Isaac had just blown through so there was no power hence no AC, that wouldn't have been an issue if you could open a window . . . But you can't. It also has what seems like permanent guests there so you don't feel comfortable leaving your things in your room or opening the door to let fresh air in. Also the bed was a FULL at best . . . . No where near a King, super low to the ground and I would not put my skin on those stained sheets even if I weren't 5months pregnant! The room was relatively clean and so was the bathroom, but there is a nice low window that comes down to about your waist while you sit on the toilet and look out onto . . . . The walkway . . . They have a no refund policy . . . For good reason, we checked in to our room, walked down to Canal st., booked a different room and checked out within 2 hours and they took our $60 dollars. The house is really an historical landmark and shouldn't be used as an hotel or hostel. They had a certificate at the front desk that said they had passed a bedbugs inspection, but like I said, we didn't stay to find out if it was true or not . . . THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY YOUR HOTEL STAY. Stay here if you want a youth hostel or a place to live for a while on the cheap.

When I went to check in, I noticed the stairs that were cracked, the hand rail was litterally falling off its hinges, and the entire front lobby had a stale smell. I checked in and was shown to the second floor. I had the better room out of the 8 that were rented by us. I didn't have dirty carpets, I had an actual closet and my bathroom was relatively clean with no bugs. My family didn't get so lucky. They made an immediate stop to Walmart, to purchase, Raid, Extra Towels, Cleaning Supplies and bug traps. They put them all to use. I was terrified about sleeping by myself so I bunked with my two Aunts. Each night, I made them go into the room first, check for roachs and other various bugs. Can we say disgusted?

The leak turned into a down poor, which turned into the entire ceiling in room 4 to come crashing down, missing him by a foot. I'm not exagerating by saying, all 15 of us checked out in one swoop.

My sister and I stayed here this past week the three days following Mardi Gras. It is a bit of a walk to get to the French Quarter, but the grounds and grande old building are BEAUTIFUL! It used to be an Infant Orphan Asylum and has so many photographs from the older days, old painted posters from the Civil War, fifteen foot windows, just magnificent. Now, to all you who had ney to say...it is an old building. It is in New Orleans, one of the muggiest places on the planet. You can only do so much to make a place built more than 150 years ago look immaculate. Do not expect The Plaza. You are booking a hostel. We had fresh linens, towels, wash clothes, and a ceiling fan. The shower had hot water and the door had a working lock and chain. The staff made a mistake with our deposit but gladly rectified it before the end of our stay and could NOT have been friendlier!!!! We had NO BUGS in our room (private room, 2 Queen beds, bathroom included). It had obviously been freshly cleaned and linened. I did find VERY interesting some of the paranormal history of the hostel. We had a few experiences, and heard of many more....from guests and overheard from staff ( yes, I am sorry, I eavesdropped....curiosity!). It added to the charm and history of the place. Although Mom thought it was a bit dodgy after looking at the reviews of others, MY EXPERIENCE was overall WAAAAYYY POSITIVE!!! I am thinking about moving to NOLA and would definitely look to St. Vincent's for weekly or monthly rates to start off my stay. The Garden District (where SV is located, border), is beautiful....many quaint shops and eateries and a close walk to Lafayette Cemetery No. 1. St. Vincent's was, to me, the epitome of olde world N'awlins charm and grace. The other guests I met where friendly and wished they'd had a private room. When you stay in a dorm setting, you must expect other people to be dirty....not everyone showers, washes the counter, or cleans up after themselves the way you do. If you don't want that, GET A PRIVATE ROOM. It is tedious trying to clean up after 80 individuals at all hours of the day and book rezzies and work the front desk and refresh linens for 75 rooms and answer the phones and take care of breakfast and look after the vending machine and pool and mopping and vacuuming!!! Give the staff a break. I was happy to get warm friendly faces with a smile through obvious tire.

First, a couple of good points: The location is fantastic! We watched the parades from St Charles Avenue, had dinner at Voodoo BBQ (near by) and it has a great coffee shop across the road (Mojos). It was also within walking distance to Canal St (half hour max on a busy night) and Bourbon St (40 minutes max). Now to the bad: Check in staff are average at best. Be sure to keep all receipts of what you have paid. The rooms are a basic 1* hotel quality, the bathrooms were a shower (with curtain) and toilet (which flushed ok sometimes) and the hand basin was in the room. The floors were not spotless, the rooms were cold (although there was a smal bar heater in the room) and overall, I would not ever stay here again. The price, for Mardi Gras week/weekend was good value for the location, and if you can tolerate no housekeeping for your stay and basic rooms, then this is your place. There is no room safe and the door lock was somewhat dodgy. The room walls are paperthin and it is very noisy at night time with people outside in the courtyard area. If you want a nice warm shower, with a nice hotel room to relax in, this is NOT your place.

Before I booked, I was told in an email by one of the (thieving) owners, Dianne, that this was their pet policy. This was confirmed again via telephone with the other owner, Peter, before I checked in. I thought, \"great, everyone is on the same page.\" WRONG. So I checked in and checked out under the same premise that I would be fully reimbursed $100, and my receipt also reflected that my deposit of $100 was FULLY refundable. Since I put the pet deposit on my credit card, I had to wait a bit for the refund to process and reflect in my bank account after I checked out. So, two weeks later I find out that only $70 was put back into my account, not the full $100. Now wait a second, this wasn't the quote previously agreed upon (by both owners!!). When I called the heistel, I mean hostel, (multiple times mind you) to find out what was going on, I was met with a lot of employees who didn't know what was going on with the situation. The incompetent staff took down messages for me, but I was never called back. Some days I would call and no one would pick up at all. After a week of this, I finally got a hold of the manager, Brandy. She told me that it wasn't the owners job to do the bookings in the first place, and that they misquoted me (not my problem!!). She also said that I was lucky to get $70 back! As if they have screwed other people over in the past for the full $100! She said that she talked to the owners and they said that this \"was a closed case\" and that there is nothing she could do about it. She apologized and said that \"every hotel has a non-refundable pet deposit\". BLANTANT THIEVERY! I was also never given Dianne's or Peter's phone number like I asked. I also emailed Dianne and Peter at the contact address listed on their website, but never got a response. You would think that the owners (DIANNE AND PETER) would at least own up to their screw-up and compensate me for the remaining money of the deposit, but no. I will never stay here again, and I will make sure my friends don't either. BOTTOM LINE: NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND NO TRANSPARENCY ON THE OWNER'S PART. INCOMPETENT STAFF AND WORSE OWNERS WHO DON'T MIND RIPPING PEOPLE OFF. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!! THE PLACE WAS SUPER NOISY ON TOP OF IT. THIS PLACE SUCKS.

It was the Inn on Burbon, and that was also a basic room, with a crappy shower, after staying there i felt better about the $180 i spent for 3 nights vs the $600 my friend spent for 3 nights plus parking.

They offered us towels and toiletries as well as bedding and allowed my friend to store his guitar in the office for our stay. There was also free wifi which was very high speed! The common space is the building and the general historical architecture was also rather pleasing - there were a lot of plush sofas and a huge dayroom as well as picnic tables outside in the garden/pool area.

So, now the bad: So we stayed here for 3 nights last week in a 22 bed dorm. We were prepared for staying in a big dorm but we assumed that whilst it would be big, the dorm would also be spacious (we all had big backpacks). This wasn't the case - the room was jammed to the full with beds with the 'aisles' in between so small only one person could get through at a time. My mattress was also rather uncomfortable - I felt like I was sleeping on planks, although most in the room were fine. There were also no security codes/keys on the doors (one which led directly outside) which meant we had no choice but to store all our valuables in a locker. There were two bathrooms attached, which were a bit on the dirty and run down side with a few bugs and the showers were small. Unfortunately, our air conditioning broke while we were here - but the staff did fix this eventually and were good about keeping us updated on the situation. The hostel also had a bit of the feel of a 'halfway house' with a few long term residents - one guy came up to us and just started rattling of his DUIs, told us he was going into rehab, and then asked for one of our half drunk beers! But for the most the other guests were friendly and not scary - although just about half the crowd was over 30. It wouldn't be hard for this hostel to improve - just remove a few bunk beds from the dorms in the less busy guest periods to make them more comfortable for everyone and spruce up the bathrooms a bit. Also, maybe cut down on the length of stay people are allowed. The general building is a beautiful historical building and could be a really nice place to stay if a few little changes were made.

At least the place is located in a fun neighborhood with lots of shops and people walking around and hanging out. Room: Unacceptable. Just unacceptable. And I am one of those people who stayed in hostels, lived on a mountain and worked on camp grounds and am not a wuss. Trust me. The room was bad, people. This is how stingy the room was: You know how no and low frills places just provide two little soaps and one tiny bottle each of cheap shampoo, conditioner and maybe lotion? Ok, this place had one of those little soaps and that's it. The tv did not have a remote. Oh, it wasn't the remote-chained-to-the-tv, which I've seen or the one that you have to check out from the front desk, which I've also done, but just completely absent. The bathroom had one roll of toilet paper. Frankly, I'm surprised they even gave us a towel. The bed was broken and at a steep angle on one corner but you couldn't see it until you sat on it. The sheet had a cigarette burn hole in it. Just unbelievable. Forget about in-room coffee machine or telephone. The wifi didn't work in the room at all, which really irritated me because I specifically asked if they had wifi. I still had to work and respond to client emails while on the trip. I had to sit right next to the desk on the first floor to get enough of a signal just to get the most basic online work finished. Parking: There was a parking lot beside the building. No charge for parking. I wouldn't trust my car to be safe here, though, so I took absolutely everything out of it. There were people just hanging out watching me do it, so I felt doubly paranoid about someone breaking into the car. Great Room: This room epitomizes the character of this place. All of the furniture is antique, but it is utterly shabby, neglected, stained, ripped, torn antique, not hip, on a budget, dinged but lovingly refurbished antique. There are very few outlets, as the place has not been updated outside of an ugly coat of paint. The room supposedly has the wifi signal, but I did not find that to be the case *anywhere in the room.* This place is just bad, guys.

Some of my friends also booked in this hostel, and they were very unhappy, as they also prebooked private rooms, but ended up in a dorm anyway, which was very dirty with lousy beds. There was no restaurant inhouse when I was there, but there is a very nice coffeehouse across the street that has everything from coffee to homemade lemonade and great subs (as well as airconditioning and free wifi). The location is actually pretty good, I was a bit afraid arriving on my own in the dark, but the next morning I discovered the neighbourhood is actually quite nice(although there sure is some dilapidation going around), with a lot of characeristic Garden District houses and quirky shops. You are also close to Charles Street with it's historic street car. Both this and the Magazine street bus take you to the French quarter easily.

There were no towels, but we figured that getting towels would at least be a fairly simple task. We went to the front desk and Eric told us that there were no towels to be had... they had all been locked up in the housekeeping closet, and that only housekeeping had keys to that closet. I was able to share a towel from a friend's room, but anticipated getting fresh towels the next day. Our bed sheets didn't look very clean (at best they were worn and old), but we figured we'd get clean sheets the next day after the maid serviced our room. Later the next day, when coming back to the hotel from a full day around NOLA, we found that our room had not been cleaned by housekeeping. We mentioned this to Eric, and he said we had an attitude that he did not appreciate. He said they do not make up the rooms on a daily basis, and this should have been explained to us upon check in. He was able to find us some ratty towels, but of course fresh sheets could not be found anywhere! I could go on with more, but you get the idea. To sum up, this place had all the charm of a 1950's mental asylum from a grade B horror film, and all the customer service you would expect in a high security prison.

People asked after me, chatted to me and generally made me feel at home and safe. I have since been back to stay at St Vincents twice and can give an honest report of this guest house. I have ALWAYS found it to be clean, clean sheets, towels etc. The building is beautiful, wide surrounding verandah's, big garden, long corridors with brilliant high ceilings (thank goodness in the summer when this building is an oasis from the heat), a big wide grand old staircase. The building is old - no one is debating that, some of the floor boards creak, there are no heated floors, fully ducted aircon, phone's in the bathroom etc. The age of the building and its history are a huge part of its charm. I have been swimming in the pool, sat in a nice cool air conditioned room and read my book, wandered around the beautiful garden district which you are in the middle of and eaten in the restaurant - it is all fabulous. I will say that I am Australian and may never understand the appeal of grits (what in the blazes is that stuff??) but all in all this is a great guest house and I have had no less than 3 positive experiences there - once alone and twice with friends who have also really enjoyed it.

And upgrades are frequently underway: the lobby was recently redecorated with antique furniture and repainted in warm rosy hues, the elevator was repaired this week, the floors were just freshly tiled in all three buildings, the hallway walls are all being refinished, and by this time next year the whole place will be a living art gallery with even more beautiful original sculptures around the premises, paintings and historic photos lining the hallways, and an actual working fine art sculpture studio on the ground floor to complement the studio I already work in upstairs.

I wonder, what exactly did you expect? Pay peanuts and get a French Quarter VIP Penthouse? Sure, St Vincent's looks old, and probably a bit rundown, but that's part of the atmosphere! You're in New Orleans, and there's no better place to feel at home than at St Vincent's. Do you want a safe place that has clean rooms, good beds, clean sheets, and private bathrooms? St Vincent's!

It's perfectly located between the Garden District and downtown/French Quarter and right across the street from Mojo, my favorite New Orleans coffee shop. The staff was unfailingly polite and friendly with me. The first time I entered my room, a woman who cleans rooms told me to \"let her know if I needed anything.\" My room was clean with 2 beds, towels, shower, tv and a spectacular view of the bridge to Algiers at night. For a room at JazzFest where I could be safe with a laptop, etc., the rates are spectacularly low and I was completely happy with my stay there. I've been there before at JazzFest and had a similarly positive experience. I stayed in the dorms in previous years and didn't have any issues there either, but can't comment on recent dorm experience. Last year I stayed there with a fairly high rolling friend who was used to staying at the Monteleone (high buck French Quarter hotel). He was initially hesitant, but ended up perfectly happy with it. At Jazz Fest all I need is a safe and reasonably clean place to lay my head and St. Vincent's is that plus a great old New Orleans historical vibe.

CROOKS - CONFLICT OF INTEREST WITH RESTAURANT\u201d", "Author": "nibloc", "ReviewID": "UR24944764", "Content": "REVIEW DATE: Feb 22nd. This review contains accurate descriptions of all aspects of the St. Vincents Guest House I can think of from the Male Dorm Room Experience. Male DORM ROOMS NOT RECOMMENDED. It is recommended that you upgrade to a private room or a different place. Only stay here if you need a place to pass out from drinking and do not have a car/park bench/tent. If you find ANY other person to room with, it is highly recommended going elsewhere. I can however run on 4 hours of sleep on low pile carpet so if this is you then it is recommended. ACCOMODATIONS: they have removed all pillows and mattresses (too many bed bugs we concluded) and you sleep on box springs in the dorms - not very comfortable. The couches in the dorm rooms or lounge are taken first. CLEANINGS: Hit and miss. Room cleanings every week or so. Daily cleanup of the property. RATES: PLEASE book online so that they do not charge you $70 per person per night for dorms during busy seasons. MARDI GRAS: This place is SO incredibly decrepid that the even during mardi gras they do not fully book up. AMENITIES: the owners and management closed the common kitchen and do not have any common areas to socialize in. DO NOT COME HERE FOR A HOSTEL EXPERIENCE: There is a conflict of interest with having a restaurant on site - for some reason the restaurant is very busy when the only kitchen is closed???? go figure that the restaurant prices are inflated when tenancy rates here go up! PLUMBING: I just overheard that the plumbing on the entire 3rd floor is broken, however the first and 2nd floor do have both hot and cold water (they reversed the hot/cold plumbing in our room for kicks). CLEANLINESS: I give this an A because they actually make an effort to keep the property clean and because the guests do a good job of cleaning. BUGS: I only saw 1 cockroach running around the toilet - but this was during the winter (February). On the ground floor, expect spiders, but I didn't get any bites. TOILETS: One 3 piece restroom per dorm room of 8 beds. COOKING: Forget it. There are no cooking appliances indoors. There are however 3 rusted hibatchi's, 1 broken propane BBQ, 1 full sized charcoal BBQ (which we used after much maintenance) and 1 smoker. WIRELESS INTERNET: Only in the lobby -> building is made of brick so even though I have a top of the line wireless laptop, I don't get reception in my room. LOCATION: Perfect for seeing the city, right on the bus line that will take you downtown and close to the major Mardi Gras Parades if you are here during that time. I give this an \"A\". RENTAL UNITS: It seems there are a lot of students and transients that will rent monthly for $2100 for 700sq feet. EMPLOYEES: I have heard nothing but griping and groaning from the managers and staff about their work since I started writing this review in the lobby, albeit if you ask ANY questions they will answer them. If you ask them for a corkscrew to open wine, or how to take the bus, or have them call a taxi, they will answer with a smile. But \"forget about mattresses or pillows\" is what I've been told by others. RESTAURANT: I just overheard the woman at the front desk say that the on site restaurant made $1000 yesterday, which is a record for this area, and for the restaurant. The front desk employee just mentioned she was helping set cutlery yesterday because the restaurant was so busy. I'm no expert on business (I've only taken my MBA) but this conflict of interest does not benefit those who want to cook themselves - or save money by cooking with others. NEIGHBOURHOOD: This is in the garden district in New Orleans - excellent location and beautiful houses. It is an lush and green neighbourhood with an interesting mix of rich family homes with run down slums and social housing ($5/month after Katrina). I was at a parade two nights ago and was 50ft from a shooting where likely a gang member was shot (only 4 blocks from the hostel). Don't worry, this is normal for the New Orleans(big american cities and didn't make the papers of course). BEDS: Are assigned - they tell you by putting your bed number on your receipt - creates a bit of confusion. PRICE: I paid $34.95USD by booking 3 weeks in advance for MARDI GRAS. PARKING: I was told by the monthly tenants/long term residents that parking is very safe in the gated off property. SUMMARY: I never write online reviews but this \"HOTEL\" was such a horrible business and I don't understand why they haven't converted the entire place to rental units. I signed up on to tripadvisor specifically to write this review. STATEMENT OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: I guess the fact that I have become so used to having mattresses/pillows in hostels that it has created a high level of bias towards a terrible experience here (but I am not alone). I have become so used to hostels providing amenities that I didn't realize how terrible things can get when a hostel does not provide those things. I didn't think I needed to pack an inflatable/air/foam mattress but it is the only thing I really need to get a good nights rest. I would not have been so dissappointed if the web site told us to bring our own mattresses. I did bring everything necessary for car camping so we are fairing better than others for a budget road trip.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Little River, California", "Title": "\u201cTerrible, Awful Bugs everwhere\u201d", "Author": "fastfoci2000", "ReviewID": "UR24082278", "Content": "Bed bugs, roaches, dirty rooms we could not stay there.

The rooms are very basic but acceptably clean. My first room was okay but the aircondition did not work, hence I was offered a room change. The new room on the third floor had a smell of smoke, thus it was a smoking room. Additionally, there was a used cigarette in the ashtray (maybe the maid has smoked?). I am normally not bothered by such little problems, so I just hid the ashtray under my bed. Bathroom was small but really okay featuring a sink, shower cabin and of course the toilet itself. The water in the pool looked rather green than clear, so I did not step in there. The staff was mostly great and attentive, although some seem to be really frustrated. The neighborhood is supposed to be safe, I often walked at night from St. Charles Ave. to Magazine St. I could also see some really expensive cars parked there, so this part should be safe at most times.

It had green carpeting that was dirty and really old and as you walked on it the floor would cave in.

Another detail - we booked this through Hostelbookers who charged us 10% deposit for the room to be applied towards the room charge ($15 since we stayed for 3 nights at $50/ night) St. Vincent refused to consider our deposit and charged us the full price ($150 + tax etc) instead of $135 + tax etc. We plan to dispute the transaction.

There was at least one domestic disturbance that took place outside the front of the guest house and did wake up some of our fellow volunteers.

We again had 17 people and several vehicles and St. Vincent's could accommodate all of us at a reasonable price (lower than the advertised price). When we arrived the staff had little knowledge that we were coming and had to scramble to put rooms together for us. (Not all room have heating, A/C). The first full day of our trip rained and we were not able to do the volunteer work we were scheduled to do for homeowners in the area. Since we had nothing to do we offered our services to St. Vincent's. They happily agreed to have us paint a guest room and several pieces of furniture. And we were happy to feel useful. Thinking we had established a great relationship with St. Vincent's we were shocked to be asked to leave one night early. You see it was New Years Eve and the day before the Sugar Bowl so they could get more money for the rooms. Mind you, we had booked through the first but apparently that was not good enough for them. We then had to find new accommodations on the busiest night of the year in New Orleans. Nice way to treat those who are trying to help you out.

At first, the place looked less cosy and much colder than on its website's pictures. But we were not appalled by the dirt, such as reported in other client reviews (still, we found a few cigarette butts under our bed). We immediately noticed that people were roaming about the halls and down and up the stairs. Were they members of staff, customers, refugees? We never knew. The staff at the desk was not very helpful and sometimes kind of rude (they gave us a wrong -not updated- taxi phone number, for instance). However, we did not experience money issues contrarily to what we read on previous customer reviews... After a couple of nights, we certainly felt that we had ended up in a very creepy place. Indeed, in the middle of the night, we could hear some strange and unidentified noises: footsteps in the hall and balconies but never entering a nearby room, moving furniture, or young kids giggling and jumping in the swimming pool at 3am... On our arrival, the lady at the reception desk had told us the hotel was a former plantor's house. But we soon found out (thanks to pictures in the hall, and guide books) that the place actually was built in the late 19th century as an orphan asylum, which is far less sexy! So, considering that the swimming pool was closed for renovation works and also very filthy, and that we never saw family with kids in the hotel during the whole week, we wonder whether the noises we heard at night came from kids of the neighborhood swimming there (that would mean the place is never locked at night!!) or whether the guy at the tourist center in the French Quarter was right when he told us the place was \"dead haunted\"???", "Date": "March 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, LA", "Title": "\u201cReservation Screw Up!!\u201d", "Author": "jmorr34", "ReviewID": "UR6842519", "Content": "I am a college student that read all of the reviews and was not looking for anything top notch at all. Just a place for 12 of us to stay for 2 nights while we party it up in the city. I had no high expectations at all and we were prepared by bringing extra sheets and pillows. We made reservations for 3 rooms with 2 double beds in the beginning of January. We called several times to confirm including more than once during the few days before our stay. When we arrived, they had us down for 1 room with 1 king size bed?!?! Wtf is that? They said the internet overbooked and they had priority since they paid in full. They even had rooms where people had not checked in yet that we could not check into. I guess a 3rd party site takes priority over placing a reservation with the front f**kin desk. They offered us the 1 room for free and the rest of us could sleep on the couches in the lobby. Did I mention the bums that were already sleeping on the couches in the lobby. They made one guy leave and then a few more came. Well most of the 12 actually stayed in that one room while a few others miraculously found another hotel WITHOUT THE HELP OR ANY TYPE OF ASSISTANCE from the front desk. The next day, the manager said that we would be charged for the 1 room. WELL, we WOULD NOT have stayed in it, but the night before they said it WOULD be compted. More Lying, and I am in dispute with my credit card company on that charge as we speak. The deskclerk was a crackhead we thought as well. The place really was scary, which I did not mind, but some of the girls did. Many of the lights in the hallways were burnt out leaving it very unsafe. The desk clerk would also leave during the middle of the night leaving no one at all for people to check in with. Overall, we probably would have been fine if they had gotten all of the rooms right. We would have put up with the place because thats what we expected from the reviews, but messing up the reservation just put it all over the line. I recommend making a reservation here over the internet because since you paid in full, you will get your room. Be prepared for crappy service, but if your coming into New Orleans for a fun night or two and dont plan on staying in your room which we planned on doing, you should be fine as long as they dont screw anything up. I also do not recommend this place for women traveling alone or with only a few. It does not seem like the safest place. Oh, and dont attempt to talk to the manager because he is a weak soul.

I'm going to talk about the pros and cons of this facility and give as measured a review as I can. Pros: - As a grad student attending a large conference, the accommodations were within my budget. - Front desk staff were not overly friendly, but friendly enough and warmed up when I was pleasant to them. Other staff were quite friendly and humorous. When the phone lines were down (see Cons, below), a desk person offered the use of her cell phone to make a call. There is sort of a no-apologies kind of mentality among staff -- (i.e. an implied \"this is simply how the guest house is.\" - Within 25 minutes walking distance to downtown NO - a nice walk during the day - Interesting building with an unusual history - Relatively effective air conditioning unit in my room - My bathroom was pretty spotless, given the rest of the facility. Also, the room was superficially clean (and by that I mean the paint was kind of marked up, there were few stains on the carpet, etc.) with new carpets. The bathroom contained 2 bars of soap, 2 plastic-wrapped cups, and clean towels (although there were small stains on some of them that had not come out in the wash) - the bed was clean (I checked for bugs and evidence of bugs as soon as I arrived) with clean linens and was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in (the double in Room 17) - there is a great little coffee shop across the road called the Mojo. Friendly staff, good coffee/tea and relatively fresh baked goods. And best of all free wireless internet access. I do not know what I would have done without this little haven. Cons: - As a female travelling alone, I was told by the staff not to walk around at night at all in the area. Post-Katrina, the area is quite deserted with pay telephones ripped out and lots of houses that have not yet been renovated after the storm. The adjacent Warehouse District has never been a good place to walk around alone in. I spent a lot on cabs. - The phone lines were completely out for a couple of days towards the end of my stay. There was never a telephone line out of my room, although I could ring down to the front desk. Make sure you have a cell phone with you. - Roaches are a fact of life in this facility - I don't mind the little ones (I had about 5 babies and 2 small ones in my bathroom at night whom I tolerated). A huge one came in on my second to last night and being a \"live and let live\" kind of gal, I fashioned a trap with one of my plastic bathroom cups and a pen and transferred him outside. Also, there was one big, dead roach behind my television set which I left there. - There was only one set of keys to my room and I was given them. This meant that no one could access my room to clean/straighten bed/give fresh towels. (this was also a plus, in my mind, as it was completely private). The cleaning staff were friendly and inquired if I needed more towels, which they hung on my door in a plastic bag. There was evidence that they were cleaning the other rooms (vaccuums, a card with towels, cleaning supplies, etc) - There are people hanging out at the front desk and bottom floor whose position at the guest house is unclear (were they staff? were they friends of the staff? were they people hired to do renovations? were they families staying there post-Katrina?) No one was rude or made me feel unsafe, but it was just a little creepy at times. I found that my humour and friendliness was an advantage in these situations. - While my room had new carpet and was fairly clean, the hallways were often dirty and the new carpet is not totally throughout the building. Someone chucked a pizza crust outside my door one day and it must have been sitting there for hours before I kicked it into the middle of the hallway so that roaches wouldn't be attracted to it and come nearer to my room. It had been picked up by the morning. I am not sure what effect the hurricanes had on this building, but it is anything like other buildings in NO, there is probably water damage, etc. which would explain some of the mildewy smell. - although it said \"no smoking please\" in my room, the guests before me had clearly been smoking and the room smelled gross until I aired it out for a few days. It was impossible to open the window, so by \"aired it out\" I mean leaving my room door open to circulate the air with the overhead fan on - the shower took awhile to get used to - to find the balance between scalding and cold. - one day after a big rainfall, the water came out of my bathroom taps quite brown for a few minutes until they ran clear again. I think that just about covers it. Overall, St. Vincent's is a very budget place to stay that would not be suitable for people who would be sensitive to not having all the usual, basic amenities and could not put up with what I have described above. I won't stay there again, but I am glad I stayed there this time because it was a bit of an adventure. Keep in mind that the clientele of the hotel range from kind of normal people and students to a bit seedy and that the guesthouse itself is located in a pretty run down area.

Lesson learned for today never book a hotel and trust the pictures they show. We booked at St. Vincent's since it looked rather nice from the pictures. It was on Magazine street which has some really nice hotels at the beginning of the street (it is a rather long street) so we just assumed it was around there. However we found it in the worst section of town with a woman who looked like she had spent her life on drugs sitting across the street. We were actually scared to leave our vehicle outside. The building looked nothing like the pictures and almost looked like something out of a horror movie. They had already charged my mom's card though so we figured we would tough it out. My husband went in only to get a very ugly attitude from the clerk and to be told she did not have our reservations. She then said the only way she would give us our room was if we gave her our card to hold until we left. UM NO! We left and called Travelocity to ask for a refund. They refused to give it to us saying we had to cancel 24 hours in advance but that they called the place and they were willing to give us our rooms now. We went back and since my husband was so upset I went in to sign the papers and get the room. As I was signing papers and finding out that most of the stuff Travelocity claimed they had they did not, a man walked in reeking of alcohol and told me, \"I am so drunk I am sober.\" Great! He was soon followed by a series of other questionable people who looked almost like they could be homeless and reeked of marijuana and alcohol who leered at me as they were walking by making me very uncomfortable. Then the lady tells me that while my infant daughter, myself, and my husband's room is on the 2nd floor of the first building my mom, my son, and my older daughter will be staying in the third floor of the second building. She then hands me keys for a series of dead bolts on the doors and a few threadbare towels! Right about then my mom comes in because my son had to go to the bathroom. We go around the corner and find a family of about 8 or 10 people in one room. They man and woman were very obviously smoking weed and were screaming at each other. The floors looked like they had not been vacummed in weeks and the front and side doors were left open where any one could just wonder in. We decided to go get something to eat after that and ran out of there as fast as we could. Both my husband and I had a really bad feeling about the place so we told my mom that we would pay for a room in Harvey if she would agree to stay there. She readily agreed and we enjoyed a nice relaxed dinner now that we did not have to worry about waking up to someone holding a knife over us while we slept.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cWonderful!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5035578", "Content": "Paying attention to reviews is a good thing, but just bear in mind that some people require a lot more luxuries than others and can be harder to please.

We had a car that stayed parked next door the entire time unharmed. The staff was fine. They didn't talk much, but who cares? As for the tv, towels, etc. Why are you watching tv in New Orleans? If you are so worried about the towels and sheets, spend part of the HUGE amount you saved by staying here at Walmart so you know they are clean during your stay. There's no question this is a dive, but we had a great experience in New Orleans last year and really look forward to staying at St. Vincent's again...for dirt cheap compared to other places. We'll be spending our savings on good food and drink! By the way, St. Vincent's has a lot of character and is a pretty cool old place.

Due to the imminent arrival of Hurricane Katrina, we've just evacuated the St. Vincent's Guest House and the city of New Orleans, along with a few other thousand people. However, my husband and I love an adventure and this latest twist (pun intended) only added to the surreal nature of this trip to our beloved city. We hoped there might be some surprises in store for us when we chose to forsake our usual comfortable, if predictable, digs in the Quarter and take a chance on staying in this former orphanage. My son's friend coined the term \"hurrica-tion\" and it's a very apt description for the atmosphere surrounding the good-natured bustle of people battening the hatches and preparing to leave. A cooperative spirit was apparent and these city-dwellers were very patient with one another. We only stayed one night at St. Vincent's due to the evacuation, but I'm very glad we did. The red brick edifice occupies an entire block. There are soaring ceilings, multiple staircases, and hallways that wander will-nilly throughout the old orphanage. What an interesting snapshot of life as it was! I felt a bit like a kid as we explored new ways to get between our room and the lobby and common areas. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms are certainly of the no frills variety, and I mean no frills, but ours was clean. The linens were faded, but looked and smelled great. The parking is wonderful: off the street and free. My only problem with our room was that the air conditioner could hardly keep up with the incredible heat and humidity. I slept comfortably, however. The television reception was okay (the rabbit ears variety), but wireless internet access was available. The $5 breakfast is not impressive, but it's cheap and convenient.

March 2005 was my first visit after talking about going for many years. I went with a companion and right away started looking for accommodations. We started researching suitable lodging. We stayed for two nights at the Hyatt and thought that it would be charming to stay at a campy, romantic, hide away off the beaten track. After perusing many sites offering rooms, bed and baths I came upon St. Vincents Guest House. Reading the description, location, history and price, I simply thought that this would be quaint, exactly what I was looking for. I was simply looking for a experience anyone can stay at a nice hotel, this to only mean that my expectations were not the highest. After having a funfilled two days in wonderful New Orleans, we packed our bags with anticipation and proceeded to our next home away from home for the next two days. We hail a cab, gave them the address. I knew immediately that we were doomed, the taxi driver did not exactly know how to get there. The site had indicated that the guest house was merely blocks away from the quarter. Remember we had been all over the quarter for the past few days and was excited and talked about taking strolls to other tourist spots. I quickly understood that would be impossible since the cab ride took at least 1/2 hour and the driver was obviously confused. We passed construction, we passed empty store fronts, obvious street corners where the down and out had staked out as there territory. Then suddenly here we are in front of St. Vincent's guest house. Still with optimism we paid the driver and walked up the steps, anticipating sitting in the wicker chairs with the fans overhead and maybe even enjoying a cocktail. When we approached the front desk that was filled with dirty laundry and got the attention of the receptionist my companion looked at me with a I told you so. He was not thrilled when I had told him about the guest house. Of course I proceeded with faith that all would be well and I would be able once we arrived to have the I told you so. After checking in and remember that your bill is paid prior to coming and I mean the money in the bank is gone! We asked where the elevator was since we had alot of luggage (whats a girl gonna do?) she said that it was broken. We proceeded up the stairs lugging and huffing an puffing the luggage along with us. Halfway there an attendant says to us why are'nt you folks using the elevator? We replied it's broken, he responds no it is not, its over there. Is it broken or not that is the question at hand now? WIth trepidation we approach, another attendant who is surrounded by dirty dishes speaks. Hey that elevator is broken folks, you can not use it. Oh well we will walk to the room, could you please direct us? He points in the direction where we should go, and then says open that door and walk on the terrace and then go through another door and you should be able to find your room. Lo and behold he's right after following instructions we find our home away from home lodging for the next two days. I must mention that there were other signs that made me realize that upon opening the door I would be greatly disappointed. Sign 1. elevator snafu. Sign 2. everyone is sitting surrounded by dirty laundry and dishes. Sign 3. finding the room took a road map and I was lucky that the veranda, terrace what ever did not fall from the weight. I take the key while my companion wipes the sweat from his face from the trek. I open the door and to my huge and utter disappointment I am suddenly in hell! The room was dirty the walls were dirty the floor dirty the towels dirty the bathroom was dirty. The beautiful white wicker furniture was not white it was worn, kinda brown, from the lack of paint, hey there is only one wicker chair. The overhead fan well lets just say it was moving in a circular motion, good because this rooms smells. The bed now the bed was small, but the linen was dirty and thin and dirty. I looked at my companion, he looked at me and we proceeded to get out our cell phone and took the phone book that was so nicely left in a handy location. I could not sit down the room was so dirty, as I called other hotels with hopes that there was a room left for to stay. After many phone calls, we were able to find alternative diggs. We dragged our luggage the way we came with comments from other attendants that did not realize the elevator was broken as they wondered why we were not using it. I went back to the front desk, remember I booked the room on-line and read the cancellation rules. If you cancel then you lose one day of the bill. Got it, please just refund the other back to my account. She lets me know that gee she can not do that only the manager can, well where is the manager? Not here ,perhaps somewhere? Okay I am on vacation no reason ot lose it is there? I am in the south away form the the hustle and bustle of San Francisco. Hey lady just tell me the procedure, I gotta go. She hands me a piece of paper with a name and number of the person who handles refunds. I continue along my merry way and manage to enjoy New Orleans like none before me.

Apart from the shower curtain the bath room was clean as well. The best thing with this guest house is that the employees were very nice to us all the time answering all our questions and arranging for our late arrival in New Orleans. The breakfast was also very good containing of grits, pancakes and eggs of different kinds made to order. To that came cereals, toast, coffee and juice. It is well worth five dollars! The pool was clean and nice as well, but nothing very fancy, just a normal pool. The A/C worked very well all the time and the hostel was very quiet at night. The TV did not work though. A 15-20 min walk is required to get to the french quarters but bus no 11 stops just outside the guesthouse. Also a taxi does not cost more than 8 dollars to the city.

The neighborhood is historic, right on Magazine Street. We spent an hour walking into antique stores and enjoying the unique architecture. We needed flowers on a weekend between Mardi Gras and Valentine's Day...and the local florist bent over backwards to help us. St. Vincent's was the site of the reception after our granddaughter's memorial service - and the staff made special effort to arrange the furniture and make sure the room was immaculate. We felt like we were in our own homes. The Housekeeper walked out late at night and lit a candle for our granddaughter at the grotto facing the entrance.

When we got there, I found out that they had only booked us for 2 nights, not 3 like I had requested. They had no issues adding us for that third night but I only wonder if someone else later got cheated out of a room because of their poor room-tracking system. Also, I had to tell them that I already paid the booking deposit, and while they didn't give me any problems about it and I was charged the correct amount after I spoke up, it made their tracking system look even more inefficient. We got to our room and while it wasn't the greatest, everything seemed clean and the carpet looked recently vacuumed, and we fortunately saw no termites or cockroaches during our stay, only a couple of flies. The TV reception wasn't good either, but we weren't there to watch TV, so it was not a big issue. On the plus side, the building had a nice historical feel to it, and the neighborhood around it was rather charming as well. I say \"charming\" in the sense that they are old buildings; unfortunately, most are pretty run-down and the neighborhood doesn't look all that safe, but it is fine if you walk in the daytime or walk with someone else at night. There are, however, many great little shops a couple of blocks down (in the opposite direction of the French Quarter), especially antique shops, and if nothing else, I would love to go back and shop on Magazine St. There is also a great coffee shop across the street from St. Vincent's, as a few people have already pointed out.

I do think the towels could have been better but I've never gotten a hotel towel in my life that I've been excited about, even at the Four Seasons. They gave my brother a room that was actually two rooms so that they had some privacy from their three kids. The a/c was good. Now, the a/c did go on the fritz in my aunt & uncle's room and when they couldn't repair it in an hour they moved them to another nice room. The pool was sparkling and we enjoyed that as well as sitting out on the big galleries (porches) and talking and meeting other guests when we weren't out doing stuff. I would say that all hallways were not spotless but not gross. Old building, yes there were some spots on the paint. But nowhere was this place as gross and filthy as described previously.

I took my parents on a walk around the neighborhood and they are from a small town and were not put off. Some beautiful homes around there. And the coffee shop across the street is great. As for walking distance to the FQ: I would say that this is a bit of a trek but not a false claim, and in any case the hotel is right on a bus line and three blocks from the streetcar for $1.25 each way, or you can get a cab. Ignore the whining of a bunch of spoiled, insulated yuppie jerks or people who live for drama and get a reasonably priced room here, close enough to the French Quarter but in a quiet neighborhood. Or, stay at a generic or FQ hotel and pay three times the money for a tiny room in the noisy quarter where parking is overpriced hell.

We stayed there and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. It is not the Hilton, but it is a unique property, a really beautiful building and the room was quite clean. Everything is not \"perfect\", but it is definitely not a dump as I have read on some of these reviews. It is a nice, family run, laid back kind of a place. Perhaps Europeans are more used to such places than Americans who are used to chain hotels. I recommend St. Vincent's and suggest that you give it a try. The prices are the best we found in New Orleans and it was close to everything and was clean and friendly - what more do you want?", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cDirty, Filthy, Nasty, but free parking and a great coffee shop across the street\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2312966", "Content": "I really hate to have to say anything about St. Vincent's because Peter was a genuinely nice fellow, but this joint is a dump by any standards.

It was unquestionably the filthiest place I've ever stayed. The good news is that there is ample free parking in the adjacent parking lot (though the lot is unsecured so it's not much better than the street). And there is a terrific coffee shop across the street (which you'll need since you won't want to eat or drink anything from the Saint Vincent's kitchen).

I have my cancellation number. NOW, today I received my credit card bill and found that this place falsely charged my credit card for a stay! I not only plan on contacting St Vincents, my credit card company, but state and local authorities. This isn't some one time accident. Read these messages, others have posted similar fraudulent charges to their credit cards. This place obviously has a pattern of pulling this type of scam on tourists and should be closed down! This type of thing simply should not be allowed to happen.

I read postings abouot this place being bad and ignored them, thinking they were posted by people who have only stayed in the Four Seasons. I thought I could tough it out, since I have slept in the mountains on many occassions, and have slept in hostels and other shady places in South America, Spain, Germany, Italy, and France. Those people who put up those postings I ignored can now say \"I told you so.\" This place was filthy. When we walked up the stairs to our room, there was garbage strewn about the hall. The carpet in our room was filthy -- various stains thorughout, stiff portions of the carpet from god knows what being spilled on it. The shower curtain had the lovely charm of mildew climbing up the inside. The curtains on the windows were covered in black dust. They only partially obscured the view of a dilapidated porch strewn with leaves, branches, coke, beer cans and other assorted trash. My wife, who is from a third world country and is not used to nice accomodations, refused to walk on the carpet or shower without shoes. The pillow case, and this is not a joke, had a printing on it that said the following: \"Property of Tulane ... Hospital. Removal from the hospital is a misdemeanor.\" There was a used plastic cup of water waiting for us when we first entered the room above the makeshift closet. As the last poster indicated, the pool was green and disgusting. There were, however, two redeeming things about this place- good water pressure and good ac. thats it. it is a total rip off for 89 bucks a night. the omni, a gorgeous hotel with full service costs 120 a night.

It's not the worst place to stay, but there are alot better out there. At the time of our stay - we were not able to get the original rooms they had for us. They had plumbing problems and put us in different rooms. The room I was in had stains all over the carpet - looking like someone tossed their cookies & left it. From the look you can tell they recently had painted the walls. The other room had a bad musty smell and the two in that room refused to sleep under the covers. What I considered the plus side is this hotel does have character formerly being an orphanage. They do serve you breakfast and the staff is extremely nice. Unless you need something in the middle of the night & then you are on your own. There is a nice place across the street you can get coffee and such. It is close enough to walk to the convention center and town if you need to. The trolley does go by the hotel, but passed the hotel every single time & made us walk back to it.
