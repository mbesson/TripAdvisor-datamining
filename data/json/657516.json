When we arrived we were able to check in strate away which was lucky as we arrived around 10 am. The room was very small and so was the bathroom but you get used to the bathroom after a while and the shower was actually very powerful. Received free bottled water everyday and toiletries which was nice. There is also complimentary tea and coffee with a kettle but no fridge or milk. That is all the hotel has to offer and there are no other facilities on site. There is free wifi but its not particularly fast.The bed is extremely uncomfortable but again once you slept on it a few days you just get used to it. A lot of reviews have said about the noise and seeing prostitutes in the hotel, we didnt have a problem with either of these. The reception staff are not particularly friendly and luckily we had no problems with anything so only spoken to them on check in and check out. The hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of a lot of attractions, failing that there is a bus stop only 2 minutes walk and train stations about 5 minutes walk that can take you where ever you want. There are plenty of shopping centres around with plenty of restaurants. Make sure you pick up a map at the airport. Raffles is nearby and try and do a trip to the night safari,china town, marina bay, little india, orchard road and universal studios at sentosa island. Things can be cheap or expensive depending on your budget. There is a free water/light show at the marina bay which is well worth going to of an evening.They dont offer airport transfers but taxis are pretty cheap and when you arrive there is a cheap shuttle bus (just go to the transport desk) There are lots of \"Hotel 81\" hotels in the area so make sure you say its the one near Shaw tower in Bugis. Location wise this hotel is excellent but it is certainly not worth the price you pay. I think there are probably more value for money hotels than this chain. Having said that, due to the location i would probably stay again.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palangkaraya, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cThe Bed Sleeper\u201d", "Author": "Geecsy", "ReviewID": "UR125870954", "Content": "That was my first trip at Singapore so Im observed the city hotel via internet which accorded with my budged, so I prefer to stayed at 81-Bugis Hotel because that hotel located strategic and near from eveywhere.

NO ref, mini-bar, spoons, or closet (just some hooks on the wall). the room does have free wifi, which was super neat. i should also mention the surprisingly good service. for a budget hotel, service was actually efficient and pleasant. the front desk staff and even the housekeeping were quite helpful in answering our questions and smiled a lot. when our first room had leaks coming from the ceiling, they immediately moved us to another room. don't come here if you are travelling with kids or if you are looking for a grand relaxing getaway. but if you're like me who came here for just a super short stay (4 days), was not keen on spending double the price on other hotels, and just wanted a clean and comfy place to rest at night, then this is the hotel for you.", "Date": "May 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cCheap-ish place to sleep near Suntec\u201d", "Author": "colingally", "ReviewID": "UR60302842", "Content": "Paid 387 Singapore Dollars for 3 nights.

This hotel which is normally priced at the lower S$100 per night peaked at over S$250 per night! It's quite expected though with the influx of close to 100,000 tourists for the event. At any rate, we were prepared for the worse after reading all the reviews about the hotel. From horror stories about guests going for hour rates to the much talked about toilet. Our first impression of the hotel was that it's not so bad. The location is wonderful! it's just off Beach Rd and a block away from Bugis Junction. It means shoppping is just around the corner. The hallways are very narrow and you can hear the activity in each room as you pass each one. We got a standard room, which the website described as a room with a queen bed (check!), and an LCD TV (check!). Okay, so there is a side table and a stool. That's it. Bed sheets were clean and that's great. Now for the toilet. In scuba diving live-aboard linggo, we call a toilet like that as an SSS toilet ([--], shave and shower). While it is very clean and has continuous running supply of hot water, it is very small. The shower head can be literally used as a bidet! What the hotel lacks in frills, the location makes up for it. It is within walking distance to 1 MRT stations - Bugis and City Hall. There are small street within the area that offer local food and late night drinks. This is a very very ideal hotel for those planning to watch the Singapore GP next year with a mid-range budget for hotel. It is close enough to the Marina area and takes away the hassle of trying to get in and out of the MRT which was just impossible due to the volume of commuters.", "Date": "October 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cBudget: upgrade for an ex-backpacker\u201d", "Author": "RE-VeeL", "ReviewID": "UR15559314", "Content": "Checked in on Thursday night and to be honest I wasn't expecting much from previous reviews. I choose it for it's location, which didn't disappoint as it was a stone's throw from all the Bugis shops (5 minutes walk around the block). From the minute I alighted the elevator and walked down the hall to my room to the sounds of \"ecstacy\" echoing down the hall my main thought was \"Good Grief! What have I got myself into?\". It was 7pm. The superior room, though very basic, was clean. However it wreaked of cigarette smoke and lacked a remote control to the LCD TV. What the hotel lacks in creature comforts, it definitely made up for in the service department as the housekeeping and reception staff attended to my complaint within 5 minutes of placing the call. That's speedy! The bathroom was small and had the \"Singapore special\" showerhead over the toilet bowl trick, (\"when in Rome\" as they say) however it was clean and that's all I really care about. My Superior Room had a: - window - Double bed - LCD TV - Telephone - Complimentary water, instant noodle cup, tea/coffee - Mini Kettle - Hair dyrer - Towels Supplied - complimentary shower cap, toothbrush - Air Conditioning (A/C) Negatives about the Room: - No closet/ wardrobe or clothes hangers - Noisy A/C unit - Noise from the hall echoed into the room so pack you heavy duty ear plugs! As for the \"love hotel\" factor... well, isn't that what all hotels are about? Hotel 81's patrons are just a little more transparent about it. At least they are in a seperate room to you and not the bunk bed below you. My verdict: If you're looking for five star hotel standards, then don't stop here. If you are an traveller who has graduated from the bunks in a backpacker's hostel want a clean no-frills place to park you stuff and yourself , this might be the hotel for you.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat location....'interesting clientelle'!!\u201d", "Author": "charlie&rich", "ReviewID": "UR12752755", "Content": "First off, it is worth mentioing that it is in a great location, smack bang in the middle of singapore city so it is very easy to see most of the main sights in the colonial district on foot. However, the hotel is very pokey with six tightly packed floors and with majority of the rooms being very small with no windows, as the hotel is a middle terrace. (I think there are 2 rooms on each floor with windows) The bathrooms are probably the smallest on earth with the shower being situated almost over the toilet! The shower is pretty poor and loses its temperature fairly quickly although it never goes cold. On a positive note the rooms are new with a nice flat screen tv (you couldn't fit a normal one in the room!!), dvd player, and pretty clean so no complaints there, although the bed is not hugely comfortable and the aircon system seems to bring in odours (smoke mainly..) from other rooms. The hotel is also situated right near a karaoke bar 2 doors up, which brings me to the subject of the clientelle! I am not totally saying this maybe the case, but it looked fairly obvious with old gentleman arriving with younger ladies shall we say, and i heard a brief discussion about hourly rates at reception. Naturally this is all asumptive and if this is no big deal to you (as it is behaind closed doors) then there are worse places to stay in Singapore. Besides, hotels are not cheap here!
