The staff doesn't speak much english, but is friendly and helpful with information about amsterdam (food, parking etc.). the boat is clean and the breakfast is good (continental). there isn't much to complain about, except from the stairs that scare the hell out of you when your drunk or in comparable conditions... It is - as said in the title - a quiet place so you can step back from partying. There is a common room which is not that comfortable, but you will be straying around in the city anyway. i liked zebra - it gave our amsterdam trip something special.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cgood stay\u201d", "Author": "pjotr77", "ReviewID": "UR121346093", "Content": "Very good for the price you pay.

The rooms were small, but there was enough room to get changed, have a shower, and sleep comfortably. The moisture on the ceiling only occurs if the shower door is open or the port hole is not open, this only happened to us on the last day, but my boyfriend and i both had showers everyday and had no problems at all. If you don't want a wet floor - put towels down. The atmosphere of the hotel was relaxed and really nice, the staff were very helpful and not at all rude. Breakfast is continental as is with most hotels and hostels (this was our 7th visit to Amsterdam), there is a fruit bread, bread rolls, cereal, coffee, tea, orange juice, yoghurt etc. We thought the botel had a very nice quirky feel and we will be DEFINATELY be booking to stay there again.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Burlington, Vermont", "Title": "\u201cStayed for two nights and it was fine.\u201d", "Author": "meeshy9842", "ReviewID": "UR108243151", "Content": "I've read a lot of negative reviews for this place both on TripAdvisor and on HostelWorld and I have to say, I didn't think it was that bad. We only stayed for two nights, and although I wouldn't say it was the best lodging I've ever had...it was safe, it had free wifi, and it was clean enough. I wouldn't recommend it for a long stay, especially if you consider yourself a more high maintenance person. The rooms are really just for sleeping (very small) and the bathroom situation is...temperamental (their toilet system is prone to having issues), but overall, you get what you paid for and it is relatively cheap considering it is Amsterdam. I'm going to say 'yes' to recommending this hotel, but I really only direct this towards people traveling on a budget or planning on a short stay in Amsterdam. Otherwise, I suggest looking elsewhere.

The cabin is incredibly small, about 2x3 m or 7x10 ft. Two people can barely move inside. The bathroom is dirty and there's mould all over the curtains. As we could see every morning, the ceiling sweats all over the cabin and the water drips from above, due to the temperature difference between inside and the water outside. The humidity inside was so intense that our clothes were humid, almost wet. The mirror is small and we could barely use it due to the humidity. The shower was poor. In a nutshell, for the same price or slightly more you can find much better accomodation in Amsterdam. I guess this is why they ask payment in cash upfront only.", "Date": "September 21, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Botel Zebra", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1166694-Reviews-Botel_Zebra-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">PO Box 2430</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1000CK</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1166694", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/c0/6c/d4/botel-zebra-thumbnail.jpg"}}
