Mind you far from all. The few good ones really tries to make a difference. The rest of this hotel is just a big joke. Stayed many times at York over the past years, office is just around the corner. Have seen the extreme drop in quality, both in the standard and in their service. Can't belive that this still is a three star hotel. Rooms are unfresh. Soiled carpets, brekfast another joke, their lobby daytime mostly like a busstation. Night time even worse. Business center, so called, not even a joke. Morning papers, forget it. Professional reception, of course not. Bed bugs in the rooms, of course. The list can be long. And few things are good news, the rest just bad. Inspite of all this the hotel has obviously been able to fill their rooms pretty well. The solution appears to have been group travel. Years back you could find many european nationalities coming with groups to stay at York. A couple of years ago it was mostly Iranians, now it seems that the groups are only from Pakistan. Don't improve the quality, just change the customers, that seems to be the idea of keeping the cash flow running. There are many really good hotels in Dubai offering fair deals. York is not one of them. Take a good advice and stay out of this place.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mashad, Iran", "Title": "\u201cnightmare after christmas !!\u201d", "Author": "RoozbeH", "ReviewID": "UR122326968", "Content": "I was booked into this hotel by my travel agent on christmass eve on a business trip to Dubai,it was located near were I needed and it was a three star so I thought it could be normal, but the minute i walked into the room the nightmare started, the place was crap ,old and shabby and more it was dirty,even the fresh (yeah right!) had stains on them!

The airport is only 15 minute drive. Now to the meat and potatoes, there is a club inside that will blow your mind, if you are single- PLEASE TAKE NOTE! the 1st time i went , i thought it was a dream, the ratio is bananas- for every one guy, there are 7 women or more- there is a live band that is pretty good, the food is great and the bear is not to expensive, maybe 30 diner. the band leaves around midnight- and thats when the dj takes over! and the place becomes a dance-a-thon, the dance floor is in the back and to the right. Back gto the women, alot of working gals, but they love to dance and so many nationalities, they aint scared to come chat with you. very interesting place and unique in many ways. by the way, the club is free before 830pm. a great place for singles, couples, and friends hanging out. The women are mostly from Ethiopia, Russia, Phillipines, iran, and other locations, but trust me, they are BEAUTIFUL!! York international is a place that- if ask any man who has been there to party- especially american or brittish- ask them where did they party and im sure ()% or better have visited THE YORK INTERNATIONAL- MORE THAN ONCE- LOL, WHAT HAPPENS IN YORK, STAYS IN YORK!
