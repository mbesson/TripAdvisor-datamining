However, for the past few years my flights have taken me to Stansted Airport rather than Heathrow, so I used a very nice guesthouse in Golders' Green. Recently I was planning a week-long trip to London for theatre and just pleasure travel. As I was flying into Heathrow this time, I thought I'd check out the options, and naturally took a look at the Cromwell Crown website. I was very pleasantly surprised to find a beautiful, very attractive site that showed pictures of rooms that were nothing like the VERY BASIC, cheap hotel (more like a 1-star hostel, really) that I had stayed at so many times before. The price had gone up (from \u00a330-35 per night a couple of year ago to \u00a359 per night now, for a basic single ensuite room), but given the renovations and upgrades that the website alluded to, I figured this was worth the extra money. Alas, it was not to be. When I arrived, nothing much had changed. The lobby still has the same old, tired, torn furniture it always had, with the same Pakistani family running it that I remembered from previous years. Another thing that had NOT changed, either, was the fact that, when the desk staff were checking me in, all they cared about was getting my full week's \"rent\" paid up front. Interestingly, they had no difficulty taking care of that! However, as it turned out, that was about the most efficient they were all week. I couldn't wait to see the renovations, but as soon as I went to the elevator, it was obvious that the Cromwell Crown really hadn't changed much except a few bits of new carpeting and higher prices. The elevator is very small (maybe two people with luggage), very slow, and very erratic. It might come, it might not. About 3 times out of 5, it eventually came, but other times, it was as if it was broken. When you asked the front desk about it, they'd just shrug and pretend they didn't understand you. My room was just like they always were: VERY basic, and small. If you're lucky, you'll get a room at the back, because if you get one at the front (facing Cromwell Road), you won't sleep without earplugs. I should also point out that there is NO airconditioning and (from what I could see) NO HEATERS in the rooms either! So don't go in August, unless sweating is something you enjoy. The web site indicates that ensuite rooms are \"spacious\", which is true if you consider 12 inches between the bed and the wall to be spacious. There is, as the web site promised, a \"work desk\" (which is really a dresser for clothes.) There was no night-stand, so I used the \"desk chair\" for my alarm clock. The bathroom featured a very strong smell of mold and mildew, which was not surprising given the cracks and holes in there. It was a most unpleasant smell. The \"colour television\" is, in fact, a TV that gets BBC 1, BBC2, ITV1, and Channel Five. Reception is spotty: some channels don't come in at all. It is definitely NOT satellite reception. The TVs are suspended from the ceiling, and there are NO remote controls in any of the rooms. I've played this game with the front desk before, but it worked the same way this time: when I asked for a remote control the first night, I was told that they would check with housekeeping the next day. When I asked again the next day, I was told that housekeeping hadn't responded to the inquiry. When I asked the third day, I was told, sorry, there aren't any remotes. There never have been: at some point I was also told that \"previous guests have stolen them!\" (In EVERY ROOM?) I was curious to see what the \"renovated\" rooms looked like, so I asked the front desk staff if I could look at one. They gave me a key, and I went to see it. First of all, I don't know where they got those photos on their web site, but they certainly are NOT rooms found in this hotel! The \"renovated\" rooms are slightly larger, with new laminate wood flooring, but the work quality in these rooms is really pretty shoddy, and they don't have AC or heat either! (Oh, and no remotes in them either: I checked!) The beds have the same worn, threadbare blankets, sheets and pillows as in my \"normal\" room, and there really aren't very many \"extras in these rooms. Those \"new\" rooms cost from \u00a375 per night for a single, and really are hugely overpriced for what you get. The web site is highly deceptive at best, and in many countries could be construed as false advertising. Another example of this is the claim about free WiFi throughout the hotel. This was particularly funny: I took my netbook to the \"renovated room\" as well as to my regular room and tried to connect: no luck at all. So I asked at the front desk: \"what about the free wifi in the rooms?\" I got the usual shrug. When I persisted with my question, the clerk simply said, \"there isn't wifi in any of the rooms: just here in the lobby.\" Oh, and to use that wifi (which is very slow, similar to dial-up speed), you have to get the clerk to give you a password. It may or may not work: what you end up doing is using the hotel's private network, so be very careful about that! I skipped breakfast, but don't be fooled by that picture of the dining room either. It doesn't look like that. In conclusion, avoid this place, unless you're on a very tight budget, you're only staying one night, and you don't mind loud, tiny rooms. I had also booked the Cromwell Crown for another trip in October, but I cancelled that booking after this fiasco. Just a few yards from the hotel is the Kensington Rooms Hotel, which has VERY nice rooms for \u00a383 pounds a night!

If 9 out of 10 visitors say it's \"bad, bad, bad!\" don't think your own visit will improve the hotel's overall quality. I thought, hey, I need this place for sleeping only after being on business all day, how bad this can be? My big regret - no pictures! But I was running so fast out of that place that didn't have time and will of taking any pictures. The biggest problem is the management. Any complain or questions is met with the same response \"There is a construction going on...\" - Which simply means they try to make renovations at their visitors' expense. CLOSE THE HOTEL for one month, renovate it, and only then open it! But no any kind of renovation will ever change this hotel, unless the management is renovated completely. You enter the lobby... Ouch! THE SMELL. Yikes. Everything looks and smells old, holes in the lobby's furniture. I get the key, go to the elevator... The old system where you have to close outside doors manually. And because someone upstairs forgets to close them - no way to go up. I tell at Reception, they simply confirm, \"Yes, someone has just not closed the doors.\" No attempt to help. Going upstairs by feet. Opening the door to my room... WHERE IS THE ROOM??!!! There is only 4sq.m cubicle with a window facing a brick wall. The bed is a size for a teenager, wall to wall. I go downstairs and ask at Reception - \"My reservation says \"Spacious renovated room, 7 sq.m!\" - Answer: \"The total size includes the bathroom. If you want an upgrade you have to pay, but we're not sure there is any bigger room available, all booked.\" (I know European measurement system, I know American measurements system, now I know THE Cromwell measurement system... \"7sq.m \"spacious\" room = 3.5sq.m room + 3.5sq.m bath... Wow! Live and learn.) Returning to the \"room\". Making the list: No remote for TV. TV set is placed on the top of a locker and is not working properly - about 5 channels, very bad picture... I didn't care for watching it but I like to listen to the news or music in the background. This TV set had annoying \"zzzzzzz\" sound for all the channels. TV set is very old, huge and ugly, some buttons are broken, etc. Next, there is a huge HOLE in the wall between the room and the bathroom. There is something inside to close that hole which looks like an old pillow or a blanket, not sure. Again, going downstairs to Reception. Answers: - \"The hole is because it's made for an air conditioner. It will be installed during construction work.\" - I ask, how can I operate TV set without a remote? Answer: \"All our TV sets are operated manually!\" - But it's close to the ceiling, I really need smth to climb but there is no chair (I'm 5.6ft, but had a really hard time reaching it). Answer: try to climb on your bed and if you still can't reach it, will turn it on for you\". (Yes, and every time I need to change the channel, I'll simply ask some nice and tall person next door to switch the channels for me, wow!). - The quality of channels and that annoying noise is because... - of course! - \"There is a construction work going on, so it gets like this from time to time.\" The bottom line is: RUN, RUN, RUN!!! I was so-oooo lucky to find another very nice hotel, 200 meters from the Earls Court, thanks to someone's cancellation. Everything around that place was completely booked but I decided to do everything possible for not coming back there. So again I was just really lucky. People, PLEASE listen to what many other hotel visitors tell you!!! (btw, I didn't write all the bad things I've seen at that hotel... otherwise this long story will be twice longer) And... This comment might insult some people (please accept my apology!), but I will still mention it. Now I realize I'm a real snob. By just looking at people who've been checking in and out at that hotel... not my company, really. You always judge a neighborhood by nice cars, and you always judge a hotel by nice people. That's IMHO.

A cracked toilet pedestal, a stinking stained shower, where you would need to be under 5 foot to fit under. In the bedroom we had a choice of six beds, two of which were bunk beds, a broken wardrobe and the carpet did not fit the room. did I mention it stank? And further to my horror (cue that Psycho music again). The outside window could not lock. Which I was advised that nobody would try and enter the building, as it was completely safe. I asked him could I have that in writing, to which he refused. I marched towards the reception to complain, the manager said we have one room available, and took me there, he said you are lucky, the family who just came to book in as I went to complain, were meant to have this room!!! The new room was pretty much the same as the previous room, but lacked furniture, again had a disgusting extremely poorly maintained 'en-suite', no wardrobe, poorly fitting carpets, the window was secure this time, IT HAD BARS ON IT!! I was still unhappy, but was told this was it, the hotel is full. I relented only as I could not get alternative accommodation elsewhere. At night the room was very cold!! There was also a broken bed, which I asked to have removed and replaced, 6 or 7 people turned up to do this!! (cue the song RIGHT SAID FRED)!!

On the website it states that every room has been thoughtfully decorated to give a fresh warm relaxing atmosphere. They may have thought about it but it is in need of more than just decoration. The sheets are old and torn. The bath towels are old and should be replaced. No hand towels or bath mat. As for satelite tv, there is a television that works of a fashion. The bathroom is dingy with paint chips and scuffs everywhere. The bath was chipped and the shower curtain looked like it has never been changed. I don't know what colour it was supposed to be it was that mancky. The window was single glazed with rotten window frames and cracked with sellotape over the crack. The draught was horrendous coming from the window and our bed was beneath it. We had one curtain at the window that we kept shut. The fan in the bathroom didn't work but luckily the tiny rusty radiator placed on the wall under the sink was hot, unlike the radiator in the bathroom which was barely warm. We did stay out as long as possible just so we could spend as little time as possible in that room. Continental breakfast was joke. They served cornflakes which were already in a bowls on the tables and toast. The staff were all foreign with little or no grasp of the english language. They served one toast rack per table regardless of how many were sat at the table so trying to get more toast was hard work. I wanted boiled water to drink in the morning so that was hard work on the first morning and I could feel myself losing my temper. My mother wanted a pot of tea so she tried to take away my pot of water but I wouldn't let her so instead she brought out a tea bag. It's like you are not allowed a pot to yourself. They also served orange cordial at breakfast. That is not and never has been orange juice. There were no glasses and definately no kettle and tea/coffee making facilites in this place. We asked for extra pillows but again without success and we asked not once but three times at different times during the day. My mother's room was a single and there was nowhere to hang her clothes. My sisters room was thrown into darkness on the second night so she demanded to be moved. Her second room was only slighty better but still way below standards that we would have expected.

The hotel is small, shabby, dirty and the 'staff' were mostly uncaring, mainly because they only seemed to communicate in shrugs if asked a question before hurriedly huddling back into groups to resume whatever language they were speaking which appeared to be Polish. We had booked a double en suite and to be fair the room itself although very small was clean from the point of view of the sheets but the decor was very shabby indeed and the bedsprings coiled like wires digging painfully into us at every turn. The TV did not have a remote control and very few stations which worked, building work was obviously underway as pipes were actually poking through an open window directly from the scaffolding outside into our room - thankfully it was a sat/sun so all was quiet, I shudder to think what happens during the week. However our main point of deep concern was the situation at breakfast - firstly we were not informed of breakfast times for a sunday morning (it was on the tiny print at the bottom of the receipt we were eventually given) and arrived just 5 minutes 'late' at 9.35am: upon enquiring we were told \"sorry too late\", 9.30 only\"; someone then went to check and showed us to the door before disappearing. I then turned the handle to open the door as I could see other people inside the room - the door was LOCKED! We were so shocked that we tried it again and again; it was firmly locked with the guests inside looking none the wiser. We then returned to reception to point out that this was a serious health and safety breach and were told \"it is because you are late\"!!! They seemed completely oblivious to the fact that you cannot just go around locking people into a room in a situation like that. We eventually gave up and went out into the fresh air to find breakfast down the road before returning to (thankfully) check out. Never ever again. Every bad review that has been recorded on this site is correct and there are plenty more on other sites which I've been reading - we think we were only saved because we had an 'en suite room'; the shared bathrooms were horrendous although ours was only a degree better. Apart from the ancient decor and distinctly shabby surroundings, something needs to be done before a tragedy occurs so please travellers, if you do stay even for one night, be aware of the serious risks being posed and plan your escape route just in case. We stayed here to cut down on costs as we were on a wine tasting experience in nearby Vinopolis and had other plans arranged so it would have been ideal as it is so centrally located but would never cut corners like that again.

So i was gutted, and kept walking up the road. The I saw the Cromwell Crown.... The paint on the render was more brown than white, the dodgy neon lights were broken, and the VACANCIES sign had only VAN IES lit up!!! I entered, and checked in. It was a fast check in, and they were helpful. I walked to the lift... i think the lifts on the Titanic are more modern! It is a very dodgy lift, it broke down a lot and I was told to be careful using it by the receptionist!!! I made my way upto my room - 502 - the lift went upto the 4th floor and then you have to climb a small staircase to the fifth floor!! Mould on the walls, white paint peeling off, even a door that had came off the hinges which was covering a fire escape door!! The 5th floor stank.... badly. The rest off the hotels smell wasent so bad though. I entered my room, and at first i thought its ok. Then I had a proper look - the bed cover was filthy, although the sheets underneath were clean!! And the towel was clean. The floor was cleanish, but could be better. The bathroom door had a huge hole in it, which had been covered up with something! (see pic) I noticed on the bedroom door a sign saying watch for anything suspicious - this made me very wary so i hid my belongings. (see pic) You had to leave the room key at reception, so i really didnt trust the hotel. At night, it was quite quiet, the road outside was loud but i still feel asleep. I hid my wallet in my jeans and my mobile in my trainers. The bed is very old, and mattress is mouldy. The bed base looks like it was made in the 1950s. I had a shower - but the shower head was rusted and fell off right away - it also had no cold water yet the hot water was not very hot so it wasent too bad. The cold tap on the sink didnt work so only had hot, and a soap from a previous guest was still in the shower. The bathroom floor is terrible, there is mould between all the tiles - it was so disgusting I put a towel over it too cover it up! The shower base is very dirty as well. I asked at Reception for an extra towel, and the receptionist got me one right away. The TV was very old, but it still worked and had 5 channels. The bedroom only consisted off a TV, Bed, Wardrobe (with no hangers!) and a knackered desk (no chair). There was a small light above the bed that flickered when on, and a tiny cabinet above the bed. I didnt have breakfast at this hotel, I went to McDonalds instead (only 5 mins walk away) The next morning i was pleased to leave, i still had all my belongings with me luckily. There is a Sainsburys opposite, and the tube is 5 mins walk, but for \u00a335 i think i should have felt safe. I know \u00a335 for one night is cheap, but the quality off the hotel is terrible compared to other hotels off similar price. I would not stay at this hotel again unless i was really desperate, I usually stay in budget hotels and this has to be one off the bad ones. Im not usually picky, sometimes things do work ok but in this hotel everything seemed run down and knackered. I would say if you are totally stuck, and there is no where else to go on a really tight budget, then consider this place. But there are far better deals out there, for instance the Royal Lancaster was available for only \u00a330 more - and you cant compare the two hotels.

The smell of bleach hit us as soon as we walked in and it soon became obvious that it was to mask the smell of filth it was so strong you could taste it.I found my room with no help or directions from the less than helpful staff. It was tiny. There was a single window with a curtain drawn across it (in the middle of the day) i pulled it back to reveal a ladder lying across it (not up against) to prevent me opening the window more than a couple of inches. The bed was awful i have thrown better mattresses away. I went into the bathroom cracked tiles no toilet roll holder and a waste bin from the 70's,metal with puppies and teddy bears lined with a plastic carrier bag. There was a tv on top of a single wardrobe with all the cables hanging down so if i opened the wardrobe door the tv will probably have come down on top of me.

When we arrived at the hovel after a long day at the History Museum and went down into the basement to reach our room - (dirty and loose stair carpet and filthy walls and what is the smell?) we were alarmed to see that our room's door handle was broken and could not be locked!

The only thing going for this place is its location. A stone's throw from the Natural History Museum, and some great restaurants and bars. That's the positives over with.

It felt unclean and the paint on the walls were stained and falling off. Needless to say the window remained open all night, as the smell of smoke (must have been a chain-smoker below) kept us company all night... The bathroom was tiny, the toilet didn't flush and every time you tried, the whole cistern fell off... There were no toilet-roll or towel holders, which only left the floor as storage or indeed the side of the bath.

We were glad we were only in the room a couple of hours before we were up again. The breakfast room was the only place that seemed reasonably clean and devoid of smell, but we didn't stay long. We were greeted with a vile lady whose belly was hanging out and rudely shoved 2 bowls of cornflakes and a tiny glass of green water in front of us. My disgust clearly showed because she had the cheek to say to me \"yes, was there anything else\". I replied there was, tea and toast, and she stomped off in a huff. When she returned it was with weak tea and bread... I looked around the room and noticed most people prodding their bread and suppressed a giggle.
