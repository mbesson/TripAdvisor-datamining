There was even paint on the bed and on the door handle of the room! The worst part was how the manager and the owner treated me when I raised the issue. The manager's defence was \"don't you trust us\" and \"well what else could we do?\". My job was to answer these questions although I really didn't get a word in edgeways with him. The owner's response was even better. He said, \" you should say thank you to us\" and \"but you weren't in the room while we did it were you!\" and finally weighed in with \"I'm the owner I can do what I like\". So if you want your room renovated (badly) while you stay you know where to go. It's a no more than average hotel but unfortunately because I went during Easter I paid almost \u00c2\u00a3100 a night. If I'd paid half that obviously I wouldn't have mined so much but if you pay that sort of money you expect slightly more. I'd also like to say that most of the staff worked really hard to make our stay pleasant, especially the sweet young boy at breakfast. If you're reading this patronising manager and fat owner, you should be ashamed of undoing all the good work of your staff/family.", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and helpful staff, great location, great breakfast, good value\u201d", "Author": "joy_s7", "ReviewID": "UR90651312", "Content": "Hotel Aslan is a small, budget, low-rise hotel (with a lift that works!) within walking distance of all the Sultanahmet region has to offer.

Breakfast overlooking the Bosphorous and the Blue Mosque was always a pleasant experience. The hotel was clean, everything seemed to work well (including the wireless internet) and the hotel was well organised. The only downside was the rooms were on the small side and most of the restaurants nearby were (not surprisingly given the location) aimed at tourists. I have no hesitation recommending Hotel Aslan.
