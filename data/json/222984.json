The Hyatt House was a good option, and I wish I had booked it for our pre-cruise as well. We checked in around 11:30 am, once we finally were able to get a taxi from the Port of Miami after our cruise (what an exercise in patience!). The hotel was able to store our luggage (our room wouldn't be ready until 3:00) and called us a taxi so we could explore Miami beach (south beach). The taxi came very quickly and cost around $30 to get to Ocean Drive. We returned to check-in to our room around 5:00 pm and the front-desk clerk offered us a complimentary cold beverage from their cooler. This small token was very much appreciated by all of us (especially for the beer). The two-bedroom suite was perfect for us. We each had a private ensuite with bath/shower, and the beds were quite comfortable. Each room had a large flat screen tv (three in total) and a very comfortable couch in the living area. We didn't use the kitchen much beyond plates and glasses, but it looked very clean and had nice appliances. There is a heated pool, which we quite enjoyed (although it was perhaps too warm!) and a lovely little hot tub. Pool towels were provided, but a bit difficult to find if you didn't walk past the path that had them. We were told there are a few restaurants in the area, but we were so exhausted that we ordered in a pizza. A couple of menus were already in the room, and the NY Pizza we ordered was quite nice. Breakfast the next morning was a bit of a disappointment. The scrambled eggs were okay and the pre-cooked bacon was alright, but the pre-made waffles were terrible - cold and hard. The hotel would benefit by investing in a couple of make-your-own waffle makers. There were also a couple of cereal options and bread to make toast. I think they had some yogurt as well. On the positive side, the eating area was fairly large and pleasant to be in (felt more like a restaurant, instead of the stuffy and plain breakfast rooms in other hotels). The shuttle from the hotel to the airport runs every half-hour, so make sure you time it right. It was a quick (less than 10 minute) and pleasant ride to the airport. Although I wouldn't hesitate to stay at this property again, there were a couple of things they didn't get right. For me I appreciate small details, and it irritated me that ALL the clocks in the room were wrong. The daylight savings change had happened a week prior, but the clocks were not adjusted. Plus, the alarm in our room suddenly went off at 5am loudly and with static. This quite affected the rest of my sleep and I would have appreciated the room attendant to make sure the alarm was turned off from the previous guest. (we never thought to check). I also would have appreciated a glass to already be placed in each bathroom, rather than having to get one from the kitchen. Overall the hotel is comfortable, conveniently located, relatively quiet (I heard a few of the bigger jets taking off, but was not terribly bothered by this; was more bothered by the screaming child next door in the middle of the night), staff were professional and efficient.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cpleasantly suprised\u201d", "Author": "lauracg524", "ReviewID": "UR126330405", "Content": "We stayed here overnight in March 2012 before a flight to Belize.

We make many moves due to my husbands service and this by far has been the best hotel we have stayed in. We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights. The first night we came in we were exhausted as we had just finished three days of packers and movers at our home for our move up North. We had a room in one minute after arriving. We asked for a first floor room, as we have three rowdy children and wanted to make no noise on an upstairs floor. It was granted immediately. Our hotel was so spacious and more importantly clean. Each morning they serve a great breakfast with many options. The manager comes around and asks how everything is going. My husband would usually go to breakfast in his Army uniform and many people would stop and thank him for his service. Including many of the employees. Incredible Service!!! Each day room service will come in and make sure everything is tidy. Monday-Thursday they have a social hour with beer and wine available. All types of Finger foods. I had never been in a place with so much to offer already included in the price. My only small complaint about the hotel was there lack of Channels on the Television. I understand they are going through a change with cable providers and that should be fixed shortly. Not really a big deal at all *****One Employee that really stood out to me was Dax. I want to specially recognize Dax for all his help. I recently misplaced my keys while at social hour. I looked everywhere for my keys. I tore my room apart, repacked all items, called the front desk, I even stopped by the Front Desk a few times, my husband also went by and no luck. Each time they would tell me no one turned anything in. It was to the point I was crying in my room. The keys were very important as they had the keys to locks on items we shipped to our new home in Maryland. I had all but given up. I decided to stop Dax by the soda machine as he was one of the few employees that I had not bothered for the keys that day. Dax immediately went to the front desk checked it out and came back with my keys. After worrying my whole day. It took him all but one minute to go and check and realize my keys were there. I cannot thank Dax enough for helping me and taking the time to actually look around. He really saved the day for me. What a superb employee. Thank you Dax your help will always be remembered. *** I recommend this hotel to all, but especially to fellow Military family who are Pcsing and are in need of a home away from home. We will miss our time in Miami and thank the Hyatt House (Summerfield Suites.) for sending us out with a Bang.

Some minor issues with operating the DVD (I know, big deal, but we did bring along one movie for our child and the issue was resolved) and the in-room telephones (which we also didn't really need as we all had cell phones).

Their parking is free and the complementary breakfast is okay, with different kinds of bread, cereals, yougurt and scrambled eggs. Next to the reception there are 4 computers with internet and printer, free to use and a gym also free. There are free towl to take to the pool. I do though still not understand american's love for carpets in hallways, breakfast-areas, lobby's & shopping mall's.... because they get really nasty... really quick, in stead of tiles that are easy to clean. This applies to this hotel aswell in hallways & breakfast area. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpfull. It's really close to the airport, but in the rooms you can't hear the planes landing and taking off, so it's not a problem. So if you've got a rentalcar this is the place to stay.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay near airport!\u201d", "Author": "Ntasmoha", "ReviewID": "UR121173578", "Content": "My husband and I stayed one night and was surprised when we were allowed to check-In two hours early and was upgraded free to a bigger room.

We booked the hotel as part of a flight and hotel package via Expedia. We only stayed one night as a pre-cruise accommodation. We originally booked a 2-bedroom 2 king unit. I called Expedia to upgrade to a trio (2-bedroom, 1 king, 2 queen unit), but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any available in the system. So the Expedia representative told me to call the hotel directly. I did and the hotel representative made a note on my reservation that I was requesting a trio. Upon check-in, the front desk staff saw the note and found us an available trio unit at no additional cost. LOCATION The hotel is about 5 minutes away from the airport, but we never heard noise from the airport. It is one block away from a shopping center that had Publix, Chinese restaurant, Starbucks, Office Depot, etc. which was great. There are a lot of stores along NW 7th St which is one block away from the hotel. The hotel is a little far if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in Miami to go to the beaches. But for a pre-cruise or post-cruise stay, it was perfect. It cost us about $28+tip taxi from the hotel to the cruise port, $23+tip from the hotel to Dolphin Mall, and $25+tip from Dolphin Mall to the hotel. You can also catch the 7 bus on NW 7th St to Dolphin Mall. PREMISES The hotel was clean. The lobby was small, but there were plenty of seating for guests to hang or wait. The grounds was well kept. STAFF Since we only stayed there one night, we only got to meet the front desk staff. They were very nice and willing to help. I always bothered them for a taxi that would accommodate 5 people and we never had to wait. A taxi was always waiting for us as soon as we got to the lobby. ROOM Our room (327) was nice except for the face towel left on the floor in the king bedroom. I guess housekeeping don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vacuum the floors after every guest. The king bedroom was spacious, but the 2 queen bedroom was a little cramped. And the beds look a little smaller than a queen bed I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to. The beds were comfortable, the pillows were a little too full for me. The living room was a little small, but big enough for 3 people to hang out in. The kitchen was small too, but sufficient. It was furnished with a fridge, stove oven, dishwasher, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, dining and cooking utensils. We were provided with paper towels, dishwashing and dishwasher detergent. There was no dining table. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a small counter by the kitchen that had 2 chairs. In the bathrooms, there were shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste, bath and facial soaps. For other amenities such as lotions, you would have to request it from housekeeping. AMENITIES Shuttle The complimentary airport shuttle took so long. I called at 1:50pm and was told to wait on the 2nd level (departure area) for the shuttle. At 2:17pm, there was no shuttle so I called to follow up. I was told that the driver was dropping off some guests at the airport and picking up someone else too arriving from another airline. The shuttle didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrive until 2:30 and we got to the hotel at 2:37pm. It was a little easier to get a shuttle coming from the hotel. The shuttles ran every half hour and provided free service within 2 miles of the hotel I believe. Just call to make sure there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a shuttle available. We took the shuttle to Publix not knowing that it was just one block away! The driver was nice enough to not complain and laughed with us when we realized how close it was. He said we can call the hotel for pick-up, but we walked back to the hotel. Internet There was complimentary wireless internet access in the room and the speed was okay. Breakfast Complimentary breakfast buffet was available M-F 6am-9:30am and Sa-Su 6am-10am. The selections were very good compared to most complimentary hotel breakfasts. They had 2 kinds of scrambled eggs, ham, oatmeal with selection of toppings, cereals, fruits, yogurt, muffins, bread, bagels, toast, milk, juice, coffee and more. Other complimentary amenities/services that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to avail of were the Evening Social (appetizers, wine, beer) available M-Th 5:30pm-7pm, grocery delivery service, 24-hour fitness center, pool and BBQ area with grills.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tyneside England", "Title": "\u201cgreat place to stay near airport\u201d", "Author": "wholelottaworld", "ReviewID": "UR120993797", "Content": "just returned from a 3 night stay at the summerfield suites and was really impressed with the hotel overall.

I've stayed 8 nights at this hotel last August (2011) and I had many small problems that turned my stay into a very uncomfortable one. 1) I was given a handicapped room, although I didn't need one, with a broken shower handle. Had to change rooms the next day. 2) The garbage disposal device was not working. Maintenance fixed it. 3) There was an unidentifiable beep inside the room. I asked the front-desk to fix it, but no answer. The next night the beep was unbearable. The maintenance changed the living room fire alarm battery and it seemed that the problem was fixed. Some hours later, when was in bed, I heard a beep again. Someone else was sent up and this time he changed the bedroom fire alarm battery. How do the other hotels handle their fire alarm batteries? Do they all wait to the fire alarm start beeping in the middle of the night in order to change them? 4) If you stay in the first floor, facing the parking lot, you can hear every car going in and out during the night. It was also possible to hear people chatting or talking at cel phones near their cars. 5) I didn't see any security cameras in the corridors, but there were many pizza leaflets under my door every night. It means there were unknown people wandering the corridors and I didn't feel very safe. 6) The free breakfast was nice, but the place was many times untidy.

We had an overnight stay in Miami after a cruise before an early morning flight out of MIA. There were 5 of us traveling (husband and I and our 19 year old daughter and her 2 friends), so we reserved the 2 bedroom king suite through the hotels website. Since our cruise was arriving early, I had requested an early check in on my reservation. We took a taxi from the port of Miami to the hotel, arriving at about 10 am. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk informed us that we couldn't do early check in, as nothing was available yet and that the room was guaranteed available at 3:00. We were kind of bummed but we knew our early check in request wasn't guaranteed. The front desk clerk offered to store our bags for us until our room became available. Not wanting to hang around until our room was ready, we inquired about car rentals in the area, and the front desk clerk said they had a car rental company that they worked with. She got them on the phone for us, and we were able to rent a car-they came and picked us up for about a 5 minute drive to the rental car location. Renting the car went smoothly and they told us to return it, just gas it up and leave it locked up in the hotel parking lot and give the keys in the provided envelope to the front desk clerk. Easy! We went shopping for a couple hours and returned back to the hotel at 1:00 hoping our room might be available, as we were tired and wanted to rest and freshen up. No room available yet. The girls were tired and needed to do some class work, and the front desk clerk offered them use of the pool area to wait for our room to be available. The girls decided to do that, so the hubby and I went and had lunch. We got back at 3:00 and now our room was ready. Rooms were large with a small full kitchen. Beds were very comfortable. Only thing wrong in the room was that the door to the bathroom in our room couldn't close easily because it was too tight and scraped the floor. But it was no big deal. Overall, the rooms were really comfortable. After a quick nap, hubby and I went out to tour around Miami while the girls stayed and napped. They girls ended up ordering pizza while we were gone, and we went out for a nice Italian dinner at Il Forno Ristorante. (EXCELLENT MEAL!) We went to bed in the comfy king size bed and got up at 5:45 in the morning to get ready for our 8:30 am flight out of MIA. Woke the girls up and found that all three slept in the other King bed. I asked why someone didn't sleep on the hide-a-bed sofa, they said it was because there were no bedding for it (pillow, sheets, blanket). I told them they should have contacted the front desk to ask for some, but they said they didn't want to bother. We got down to the lobby at 6:15 to have a bit of breakfast before we took the hotel provided shuttle to Miami airport. The breakfast options were great: cereals, fruit, yogurt, pastries, bagels, hot scrambled eggs, juices etc. The hotel shuttle arrived at 6:30 (it leaves every half hour) and took us for a short ride to MIA. Overall, I really liked our experience here. The ammenites provided are really good at a decent price, and if we are ever in need of an airport close to MIA again, I would definately stay here again.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent option near Miami Airport\u201d", "Author": "Ruth11111111", "ReviewID": "UR100566415", "Content": "We spent one night when arriving from vegas and before getting on a cruise.

The fact that I'm taking precious time away from my family to submit this review should assist those who read this in understanding just how serious this review is. I'll start on a positive note: On 12/5/10, I stayed at the Hyatt Summerfield Suites Miami Airport with my wife and my 2 year old. The hotel was clean enough and it was literally 2 minutes from Miami International Airport. We also had good customer service from the initial desk clerk (Annie). NOW FOR THE BAD: Where do I begin? Nobody at the door offered to assist us with our 6 bags of luggage when we exited the taxi. I previously confirmed an early check-in prior to arrival, however, the room was not ready and we had to wait for 1 & 1/2 hours for it to be prepared. We requested a crib and they brought us a pack-and-play, which would have been fine if it wasn't BROKEN! Their website indicated they offered complimentary shuttle service within a 2-mile radius, however, upon asking to go to the nearest shopping center (within 2 miles) we were told it would cost $10. While attempting to take a nap in the afternoon, there was a loud sound, like a commercial washing machine in cycle, coming from the walls. I contacted the front desk and was told they would check into it, then call me back. They never called and the sound never stopped, so there went our nap. Tried to take a bath, but the drain stop was broken and rusted! Around 10 PM, we attempted to go to sleep (6 AM departure flight and all...) and the sound started again. I went down to the front desk and VERY respectfully requested to talk to the manager on duty. A female came from the back and IMMEDIATELY began speaking to me in a condescending tone stating, \"There is no washers or dryers close to your room. I don't know what you're hearing.\" - Verbatim. I kept my cool and asked that someone come to the room and listen for themselves. The manager called someone on a walkie-talkie. A security guard came to the desk and she began speaking to him in Spanish about me, not realizing that with 4 years of Spanish I can understand certain things, as well as the fact that it was rude behavior also. Anyways, to make a long story short, you'll pay about $140 for crappy customer service (unless it's Annie), a sub-par setting, loud noises to keep you awake, and have to deal with front desk managers who are rude, disdainful, and antagonistic. Oh yeah, that would be front desk manager Linda Guzman. Hope this helps somebody avoid the disaster we just experienced.

The main issue was the shuttle service. I was EXTREMELY disappointed/dissatisfied with the shuttle service from the airport. We arrived in Miami Thanksgiving night (around 8:45pm), as we were going on a cruise the next day. Once we landed, I called the hotel to inquiry about pickup times. The clerk (don't know her name) said the driver would be there in 10 minutes (9:00 run) and if we missed him, he would be back in 30 minutes. My wife and I went outside to the shuttle pickup area (the departure level) and waited for OVER AN HOUR for the shuttle that never came! We probably saw a shuttle for every other hotel chain drive through that area multiple times, without seeing HSS once. I even asked the airport personnel to call the hotel (twice), and they were told that a shuttle was coming but couldn't give him a time. The airport guy even told us that HHS shuttles didn't come regularly. Wish I would've known that beforehand. We eventually gave up, after 10:00pm and took a cab to the hotel. It was late and it didn't make sense for us to continue waiting for a shuttle that never showed up, while seeing other hotel shuttles coming by so often. The main reason for choosing this hotel, and not the Hyatt downtown, was because of the supposedly free shuttle service from the airport! And to make matters worse, when we finally got to the hotel via taxi, of course the shuttle is sitting right outside. Unfortunately, upon checking in the hotel and explaining the situation and expressing some frustration, the clerk barely apologized and didn't offer us anything to make up for the lack of service. It was nice to hear that one of the other reviewers was at least upgraded to a larger room. That would have been nice, but luckily we were only going to be there for one night. The second problem (albeit minor) was with our TV in the living area of the suite. While the TV in the bedroom worked fine, the one in the living room was stuck on TBS and you could not change the channel with the remote on on the TV itself. There was no way to turn the channel on that TV, because the problem was with the TV and not with the remote. I asked the front desk for assistance and they said the guy couldn't help us at that moment, but could help later in the night. It was already late, since we arrived later than expected because of the lack of shuttle service, so I told him to forget it, since we were only staying overnight. Real quick - the quality of the room itself was fine and there were no complaints from that standpoint. Check-in and out were smooth as well. I tend to agree with the previous reviewers overall (including the loud flushing). If you rent a car, and need to stay near the airport, then you will probably be fine and happy with the accommodations. Unfortunately, I probably would not stay here again because there are other choices near the airport (if needed) that I believe are more reliable. And if we rent a car next time, as we have done in the past, we would most likely stay downtown or at the beach. As my title states, this hotel is suitable so long as you are not counting on (or need) the shuttle service.

We chose the HSS for proximity to the airport since our flight was out pretty early the next morning and wanted a property offering a shuttle. There were only two hitches we encountered (and they were minor) for our stay. The first was the slowness in having the shuttle pick us up at the airport. It took 2 or 3 phone calls (and more than a l/2 hour) to be picked up. When we did arrive at the hotel, the check in was smooth and the desk could not have been nicer to us, and very apologetic for the wait. In fact, they were nice enough to upgrade us to a two bedroom and two bathroom suite. This was most appreciated as my husband had gotten a pretty nasty cold and he was glad to have a bedroom and bath of his ''own'' in which to suffer and recuperate! The hotel also offered shuttle service to guests to nearby restaurants and we took advantage of this service (actually close enough to walk, but we decided we were a little too beat). We took the recommendation of the shuttle driver and desk person and went to eat dinner at the Cuban restaurant at the nearby shopping center and it was phenomenal and reasonable. HEARTILY recommend this place. The suite was simply beautiful. It was large with a full kitchen and comfy living room, nicely furnished and we felt it was a shame we could not take advantage of the amenities, but a family or group would find this place ideal--full size fridge, stove, dishwasher, etc., small dining space, etc. The suite was immaculately clean, the bedrooms and living area all had large flat screens. The beds were extremely comfortable too. We had no complaints whatsoever about the suite, it was great. The second small issue was the breakfast. It's great to have the opportunity to take advantage of an included breakfast, but we did not have the time before our flight to do that, so I thought we could run in and pick up some kind of wrapped bagel or muffin and perhaps a banana or yogurt to bring to the airport with us. There were no 'grab and go' food opportunities that I could see, so the only thing we could take advantage of was the coffee machine in our suite. Other than these two minor glitches, I cannot say enough about this place and heartily recommend the Hyatt Summerfield Suites near Miami airport wholeheartedly.

They also have an early evening wine and snack, but we weren't there for that. We took the complimentary airport shuttle, and it was prompt. The driver was nice enough to take us to a Cuban restaurant that's about a mile from the hotel and then picked us up when were finished. On the way back from St. Kitts, they recommended a seafood restaurant, and we took a cab to that. It was a nice, casual place with an outdoor patio with a huge TV screen. People were hanging out, watching Monday night football and enjoying oyster specials. This hotel is great for families or large groups who need to sleep a lot of people or for anyone who is staying or a while in Miami.

The website only has the central 800 number and makes no mention of needing to call. Nor is the hotel listed on the board at ther airport. she then said that the service stopped at 11:30pm.

Once we retrieved our luggage, we called the hotel and they told us to proceed to the Departure Area (baggage retrieval was on the 1st floor, Departures are on the 2nd Floor) and wait for the Shuttle. It arrived about 25 minutes later. We had requested a Trio Suite (2 bedrooms, 3 beds) and were given a double. (If you make your reservations on-line, make sure you call the hotel and ask them to guarantee the rooms you chose.) We asked the front desk to change us, but unfortunately they were all occupied. So, they added a One Bedroom Suite for my husband and I at no charge! Our daughter (18) and son (21) had the Two Bedroom Suite, 2 King-Sized Beds, all to theirselves. Both rooms were on the 2nd floor, not far from each other. Now, that's what I call Customer Service! We checked in around 2:30 p.m., put our luggage in our rooms, freshened up, and asked about the cuban restaurant in the plaza behind the hotel (about a 10-15 minute walk). As we proceeded out of the property for our walk, one of the Shuttle drivers saw us, stopped, and took us to the restaurant. It was a hot and humid day so we were very thankful he saw us. We gave him a tip and went inside the restaurant. It was very clean and nicely decorated. We were the only one's there for the first hour and had fantastic service. The food was incredible as was the cuban beer they offered. We left the restaurant at about 5:30 p.m. (what can I say, we ate and ate and relaxed....we were on vacation!) and walked around the shopping complex on our way back to the hotel. My daughter and I found a shoe store with very inexpensive prices on sandals (buy one, next one 50% off) so she bought 2 pairs. We all then went into their Supermarket (Publix, I think) and bought some bottled water together with some munchies for later, although the kids bought ice cream from the hotel store around 7:30. The other food places we saw in the plaza was a nice looking Italian Restaurant and a Starbucks (there may be more but these were what we saw on the way back to the hotel). We took a leisurely walk back to the hotel (around 6:30 p.m.) as it was much cooler out. We all turned in pretty early because our morning started out around 4:00 a.m. The next morning, we went down and had breakfast which had a pretty good assortment (bagels, toast, danish, eggs, bacon, yogurt, cereals, milk, coffee, tea, juices, etc. Our flight to Barbados was 9:55 a.m., so we checked out and caught the 7:30 a.m. Shuttle. Upon our return, we were given the Trio Suite (3rd Floor). All suites were wonderful (both coming and going), extraordinarily clean, extremely quiet, and comfortable. The kitchen cabinets were stocked with all the conveniences of home for cooking and eating. We checked in at 7:30 p.m., after the last Shopping Mall shuttle picked up from the hotel, so we dropped our luggage into the room and asked the front desk to call us a taxi. It arrived about 10 minutes later and was around $23 to the Mall. I can't remember the name of it but it is huge. We ate delicious food at the Kobe Steakhouse and had a fun time. We caught a waiting taxi found easily outside the eating establishments. The next morning, we ate breakfast again and since our flight back to Vegas was not until 4:00 p.m., we asked for a late check-out (1:00 p.m.) and washed our clothes from the last 2 weeks in the Guest Laundry. You can purchase detergent and softener in the hotel store. We ordered pizza for lunch (from menus slipped under the hotel doors) at 11:30 which was suppose to be delivered at 12:00. Unfortunately, it was delivered at 12:55 and was cold, but the Front Desk was very kind and told us we could stay in our room to eat it. We warmed up the pizza, ate, ran the dishwasher, and checked out around 1:35. Oneof the Shuttle Driver's saw us coming off the elevator and took us directly to the airport instead of making us wait until 2:00. Our experience with this hotel could not have been better.

The breakfast buffet has much better choices at Hampton Inn. I never had any internet wireless access problems at Hampton Inn, but often found the signal dropping while at Hyatt. Security was better at Hampton Inn; you have to use your room key to activate the gates to the parking garage and to take the elevator up to the guest rooms at Hampton Inn, whereas at Hyatt Summerfield you just park your car in an open lot surrounding the hotel and there is no room-key control of the elevator.

This hotel was the best value we could find in south Florida for an upscale suite hotel (in particular, for a 2-bedroom suite). Overall, this is a pleasant, comfortable hotel, with courteous and helpful staff. However, it has a number of problems as well. Cleanliness: To be fair to the property, one cannot expect housekeeping staff to thoroughly clean the equivalent of over 100 small apartments every morning. However, except when we complained, what housekeeping did each morning was make the beds, change the towels, and throw the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and turn it on, then leave. We found the suite slightly dirty (particularly the bathrooms) upon arrival, and it appears the suite would only be fairly well cleaned between guests, regardless of the length of stay. We expected a more thorough cleaning at least every few days, but this did not happen. Rooms: We had a two-bedroom suite, however, in size it was smaller than other Summerfield Suites we have stayed in, and not quite as nicely decorated. There was one clock in the entire two bedroom suite (c'mon, this isn't Vegas), and were only two telephones in the entire suite (one in each of the bedrooms). We were severly lacking silverware and cups. Otherwise, the rooms were well furnished and equipped. Both bathtubs had a small leak so they did not stay filled. The living room had a flat panel TV (37 inch), each bedroom had a TV. We had free wireless internet, although it was about as slow as dial-up. The beds were pretty comfortable, and the air conditioning was efficient, although noisy in the living room/kitchen area. Buffet: What the last review said was generally true, the buffet (which had terrible food) was overwhelmed by hotel guests. Many items ran short, particularly over this holiday period. For example, they were out of lids for paper coffee cups for three days. A hotel like this generally has a mix of business travellers (waking early, eating light) and tourists (waking later, eating more or not at all), so the buffet can usually accommodate this trickle of guests with modest provisions and a small dining room. At this location, the buffet was just overwhelmed. The smaller evening happy hour had shortages also, but fewer problems. Overall, it was best to slip in, get a piece of fruit, toast and coffee, and escape to one's room. If the breakfast is a consideration, avoid this hotel. Staff: The staff were friendly and courteous, but ambivalent about the hotel running out of items such as kitchen towels and laundry bags. The shuttle to the airport did a nice job getting us to our flight, they have two nice vans and two drivers, but it is not a 24-hour service. (It cuts off at 10:30 p.m.) Security: While we were at the hotel, a guest had their portable NAV system stolen out of their unlocked car parked in front of the hotel. However, Miami police were parking around the hotel for the next couple of days. The immediate area of the hotel seemed safe enough, and we had no problems. I would advise locking your car and being aware of your surroundings. (It is Miami, after all) Location: The hotel is located in a narrow strip of hotels and office buildings between the airport to the north and residential Miami to the south. The nice areas of Miami generally are the south (Coral Gables, South Miami and Kendall) and the beach (Miami Beach, Key Biscayne). By driving south 15 minutes or east 15 minutes, either area could be easily reached. I ventured into the working-class mainly-immigrant area several blocks south of the hotel for some Cuban food, and felt the area was fine, but it is not the best area. The hotel is pretty convenient if you have a car and are flying in and out of the area and need relatively easy access to different areas of Miami. Key Biscayne has a very nice family beach ($5.00 for parking, north-east side of the island, called Crandon Park). You can avoid crowds of tourists by dining and shopping in South Miami, Kendall and Coral Gables. Just south of the hotel there are 24-hour Walgreens and CVS, we never seemed to find Publix (the supermarket) open by the time we returned to the hotel area. Pool, Fitness Center, Business Center, Barbeques: With the exception of the \"business center\" (4 computers with super slow internet) which seemed always in use, mainly by teenagers, the hotel facilities were generally nice and available. We did not use the pool or barbeques but they seemed nice enough. This type of hotel usually has no restaurant apart from the complimentary buffet, and this hotel had no restaurant and none adjacent to it. Price: At $204/night, this was 25-50% less than what this hotel would cost if it were located in Ft. Lauderdale or Miami Beach. However, the hotel has plenty of competition, with Homewood Suites and Hampton Inn (both suites hotels) nearby. I found the cheapest price directly on the hotel website, although I believe they can be booked through Priceline for less (probably a blind booking.)", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgium", "Title": "\u201cConfortable suites but inapropriate breakfast buffet\u201d", "Author": "jcparmentier", "ReviewID": "UR12215452", "Content": "I stayed 9 nights with my family in december 2007 for the Christmas holidays and we were accomodated in a one bedroom suite with 2 double beds.

We arrived at the Miami Airport 1 pm sharp. As instructed by the hotel employee previously, we called the hotel for the free shuttle to pick us up. We were told the shuttle should arrive around 1:15pm. Later, the employee called and said the shuttle was running 30 minutes behind. He told us to get a taxi to the hotel and the taxi fare will be taken care of by the hotel. I was skeptical, but since I had no way of knowing when the shuttle is actually going to arrive, we went ahead and got a taxi. When I arrived at the hotel, I put the taxi fare receipt on the counter,. Without my saying a word, the front desk clerk handed me $14 cash. We paid $61 through Hotwire for the room. It came to $73 with taxes. We had a one bedroom suite with full kitchen. Everything looked really nice, new, and clean. The king size bed was comfortable with new linens. The kids slept on the sectional sofa bed. Our room was facing the street and a corner of the airport (I could see the tails of the planes), but it was surprisingly quiet. If you are very sensitive about sounds, you may have to request rooms in the back of the hotel. They had freshly baked chocolate chip and peanut butter cookiesin the lobby aound check-in time. We also had free dinner (Thursdays until August 31) that night at the hotel. The next morning, we had free breakfast buffet (every morning). Free coffee, tea, and soda were available through out the day. We saved quite a bit of money on dining by staying at Hyatt Summerfield. The hotel was within walking distance to Publix. We purchased many essentials that we could not put in our carry-ons. In the evening, the kids had a blast in the pool, making new friends in the process.

We paid $279, which doesn't sound like a great bargain, but it was cheaper than two standard rooms we could find at any comparable hotels. The suite was clean and comfortable and the bathrooms were a cut above average. For those who couldn't find the wastebaskets, they are in he cabinets under the sink in both bathrooms. We didn't use the pool, but it looked fine; more like something kids would enjoy at the end of the day than a place you would want to spend the afternoon. For dinner we walked around the block to a Cuban restaurant in the same shopping center as the Publix grocery store. It was pleasant and reasonable. The breaksfast buffet was more than ample, with many choices: cereal, yogurt, fruit, french toast, bacon, various breads (including bagels) that you could toast yourself, and crossiants.

The pool was very nice and never busy. There was not a lot of inside or outside noise that we ever heard in our room and I am a very light sleeper. We had booked a 2 bedroom as we were travelling with our son (16) and daughter (12). It was very nice to have the two very large rooms with enough space for all our luggage and us. The beds were very comfortable and there were two nice bathrooms. The kitchen was a real convenience if just for snacks and drinks. The only inconvenient part is the location as it is quite far from alot of the tourist type things. One way cab fare to Dolphin Mall is $25. Downtown Miami we were quoted as at least $40.

The hotel is happy to pick you up anytime from the Miami International airport, which is about a 5-10 minute drive but they will not drive you to the bay/port from where cruises start. We checked into a 1-bdr suite. The suite had a separate living room with attached kitchenette and a separate (there is a door in between) bedroom with attached bathroom. The kitchen has a dishwasher, microwave, and fridge; you may want to bring your own dishwashing liquid. The infant bed was a proper bed and not just a pack-n-play; but they did not have blankets for the small bed. The shower was among the best I have ever used, in terms of adjustable water temperature and pressure. The rooms are spacious. The carpets spelt fresh even with the generally high humidity of Miami. There is a VCR and TV in the living room and a separate TV in the bedroom. There is high speed free internet access (wireless). The hotel is a block away from a strip mall that has a gas station, a pharmacy, a Chinese restaurant, a fast food place, and a big supermarket (Publix). There is also a hospital nearby. The hotel has a bunch of coin-operated washers and dryers, but all except one were non-functional for the 4 days we stayed at the hotel. In May 2006, they charged $2 for a wash and $2 for 30 minutes of drying time which seemed a bit steep. The room did have an ironing board and iron but the board was wobbly and creaky. There is plenty of free parking. The neighborhood seemed very clean and safe. There are no great places to eat within walking distance. Some of the best restaurants in the city are at least a 20-30 minute drive. There is a nice swimming pool (no laps though) and a nice whirlpool (both shut at 10 pm). The pool area seemed to run out of pool towels often. There are several outdoor grills in the pool area. The morning breakfast is complimentary. The breakfast was not great but there was fresh fruit, cereals, scrambled eggs, milk, coffee; just the usual fare. The staff was very helpful, smiling, and just wonderful.
