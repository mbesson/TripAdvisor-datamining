My room was a Deluxe King, which was very roomy and comfortable. Any of the staff members I encountered were very pleasant and seemed committed to making my stay enjoyable. There were little things that could be tweaked, but nothing to make a big deal about. The bathrooms could use some updating and the decor, while lovely in some spots, is a bit tired. Some minor annoyances: there were only 3 pillows on a king sized bed, there were a few 'out-of-orders' on things like ice and pop machines and the remote for the television worked only part of the time. I had the sense that if I'd wanted to make an issue of any of this, the staff would have made a concerted effort to make it right. A high note was the room service!

As an out-of-towner coming to Toronto for the weekend, I jumped at a deal to stay at The Sutton Place, $125 / night. When we arrived, the front desk staff who checked us in was strictly on auto pilot. She offered little eye contact and just went through the motions. Perhaps she was having an 'off' day. Our room was acceptable, but much smaller than I expected for a fine hotel. It actually felt cramped. However, everything was very clean and the beds were wonderfully comfortable. The one big bone to pick for us was the noise; noise from Bay Street (our room faced Bay) and noise from the hallway and the adjacent rooms. The walls can't be properly soundproofed, and the windows must not have the soundproofing qualities needed to keep street noise at 'bay' (no pun intented). Making matters worse, there was no air conditioning unit or source of white noise in the room to drown out all those irritating sounds. We requested that a fan be sent up to our room and thankfully the hotel obliged. We had it blowing at top speed all night. It was the one thing that allowed us to get some sleep. No doubt a room facing away from Bay Street would take care of the street noise, but there might still be the matter of noisy neighbours and hall walkers. It always puzzles me why some hotels forget about the noise factor. The number one reason people use a hotel is to sleep afterall, and I for one don't sleep well with a freeway under my window.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMarch Break Stay\u201d", "Author": "Karl R", "ReviewID": "UR126133999", "Content": "My Son and I took a trip to TO to see the Mayan show at the ROM and we stayed at the Sutton Place while in Toronto.

A bit over priced, but it's average for the city. Helpful doormen and concierge. Now the Bad... I was close to the elevators and at first it wasn't much of a deal, however, as the night wore on it became a constant noise you couldn't get away from. The TV remote was either broken or in need of some fresh battery. The toilet flushed only after many attempts. No fans in the bathrooms. I don't think the ice bucket and tongs have been clean in a week, so sticky I washed them myself. Now the Ugly... After the first night wondering what that smell was... I discovered a rotting apple under my bed. Clearly from a previous guest, but the staff missed it after their \"cleaning\" then and again after my first night cleaning. Since it had that \"cider\" smell I would guess it had been their for at least 4 days. As I checked out, the front desk staff didn't even ask how my stay was, just wanted a to know how I would pay my parking bill. I told them about my experience and they took notes and said they would tell the cleaning staff. No offer to make it right, no apologies, just a thanks for coming.

The individuals on staff at the Sutton Place Hotel Toronto are wonderful. I continue to come here as I have been for eleven years or so now, approximately five times a year, sometimes more, for 10 days to two weeks at a time and I am always received courteously, with warmth even when the front desk staff are at their busiest. The housekeeping staff are responsive, polite and kind always trying to provide anything I ask for. The restaurant staff are friendly and accommodating, the concierges are knowledgeable and helpful. The doormen are efficient and welcoming. The various managers are responsible and serviceable. What more could you want? For the price this is the best central accommodation in The Yorkville/University of Toronto/ROM area and the best in the city in my opinion. Some people are just picky and too hard to please I suppose. Everyone who works at this hotel is obviously dedicated to their job and involved in a personable way with clients who come and go. I believe that it is the staff, their flexibility and their amenability that have made the Sutton Place Toronto a home away from home for the many of us who are not impossible to please.

We had a lovely time visiting friends & family, sightseeing, shopping, and dining out. However, the trip was soured in great part by our stay at the Sutton Place Hotel, which was terrible.. We booked through Hotwire.ca and got a good price for a Queen bed room. Upon arrival we were given a room with a queen bed in it, sure enough. However, the room was apparently created from some sort of storage area: very small, low ceiling, peeling wallpaper placed over cracked walls with mildew and mould, a tiny closet, an out of date, dingy bathroom, a burned out lightbulb in the desk lamp, etc. I called the front desk, asked for another room and said the one assigned was not satisfactory, whereupon the desk clerk snapped \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wrong with it\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. When I started to explain the room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deficiencies, she cut me off and said \"Fine, we'll switch you\". There was no apology, nor offer to come up with another set of keys or request for us to return to the front desk. We went back to the front desk where I was asked by the desk clerk \"Are you the one who wants a new room\". I explained that, yes, I was, and thanked her for accommodating us. As I turned away with the new keys, my partner observed that the clerk looked me up and down and made a rude face in my direction. While unpacking, we noted there were no robes in the closet, as advertised. We called down and requested that 2 be brought up. We tipped for this service. We toured the hotel and stopped in the main floor bistro for drinks and a snack. The attitude of the waiter left much to be desired, as though we were inconveniencing him by sitting in his area. Note: another evening, same waiter, same attitude. The housekeeping staff was a whole gem unto its own. Three days in a row the counters and mirrors were not wiped (coffee stains and splattered toothpaste marks were present before and after \"cleaning\"), The floor wasn't swept/mopped, as evidenced by a disposable contact lens and Q-tip on the floor beside the emptied waste basket when we walked in after cleaning was done. The bathtub wasn't washed, as evidenced by the hairs in the tub. Hmmmmmmm.... guess who didn't have a bath during their stay??? My small bottles of salon shampoo and conditioner, filled to the top on day 1, mysteriously were half-empty on day 4. I only use 1 tbsp per shampoo and was surprised to see so much missing when I next showered. We asked for a non-smoking room, which we received. However, there were smokers in other rooms on the floor, one in particular smoking cigar(s)... It was nauseating having to pass through the stench of the smoke as we went to and from the elevators each time. On our final night, a group of 18-20 yr olds stayed in the rooms beside and across the hall from us. From 9:00pm until 11:30pm they yelled, swore, slammed the doors as they ran back and forth, their dog (!!) barked. We called security at 11:00pm and complained, and were told that only because it was after 11:00, a security person would be sent up to speak with the guests. The guard told the partiers that there had been a complaint about the noise and could they \"keep it down and not slam the doors\". Of course the idiots said \"sure, sure, we're going out anyway\"; after another half hour of yelling and door slamming, left. We feared that they would return in an even worse state when the nightclubs closed. Sure enough, at 2:00am, we were awakened to loud swearing, yelling in the room next to us as well as in the hall, and doors to both rooms slamming. Despite another warning by Security, the noise/fighting continued and the offending guests were not asked to leave. Kudos must be given to the young woman on the front desk when we checked out the next day. We had been charged for an extra night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s parking and made mention of this to her. She immediately adjusted our bill and apologized for the error. My partner mentioned the disruption to our previous night and asked what the hotel was prepared to do in compensation. The young woman listened to our complaint and immediately offered to remove some charges from our bill, which we accepted. The only other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153positive\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd encountered during our stay at the Sutton Place was the discovery of the hotel spa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s registered massage therapist, Raissa Trusevych.

The radio was not difficult to program; you'll be surprised at how difficult some can be. There wasn't a robe in the room, which I would have thought would have been there given the class of hotel. The location is good. It is close to restaurants -- there's one across the road, two in the building next door (plus a burger joint and a pub) and a fair number up Bay street. A block east of the hotel is Yonge street. Yorkville is 5 minutes walk. If you can't find a restaurant there you are beyond hope. West of the hotel is the U of T.

Having never stayed at the Sutton Place before, I was quite looking forward to my night there. First, the good. The location is great, a short walk to the subway station, reasonable parking rates ($25/day) and an easy walk to Yonge St and Bloor St. The hotel is very clean and full of marble and shiny brass like most others. I was given a room on the fourth floor. My room was quite large, although the bathroom was quite small. Nice queen bed and modern television, clean, but a little tired and dated. Bed was clean and comfortable. Now the not so good. When booking a hotel, there are two overriding features for me: a good night sleep and a good shower in the morning. Here the Sutton Place fails miserably. As my lower floor room was located close to the corner of Bay and Wellesley Streets, I got to listen to road noise until the wee hours when exhaustion finally over took aggrevation and I finally fell asleep. Sleep was short lived as the early morning commuter traffic quickly replaced the nightcrawlers and I was once again resting, but not sleeping at the Sutton. The hotel can't help the road noise, but they can surely use noise insulating glass etc like others do to drown out the outside noise. Still cranky from the lack of sleep, I got up to have a shower. Here, like most other major hotels, the Sutton has managed to restrict the amount of water flow so that it still counts as a shower even though you barely get wet. I am not sure what this flow rate is, but it doesn't seem to matter how much a room costs, all hotel managers have this secret formula to make sure only minimal water actually reaches the tired traveller. Nothing like an invigorating trickle to get the blood flowing in the morning.

Filthy carpet, a big hole in the wall, stained sheets, and the very small bathroom that was never properly cleaned for ages. Kitchen was also a little creppy with a loud fridge and very old microwave and dishwasher.

The furnishings attempt to give the room an 'upscale' feel, however, come across as being tacky - something one would expect out of the 1980s. The bathroom was very small and not the most functional. Beds were comfortable. Linens were clean and crisp. Didn't sleep the best because there was a lot of noise coming from the hallway. When in the lobby, on two separate occasions we heard customers arguing with the front desk clerk and vowing never to stay there again. Definitely does not create the most inviting atmosphere. I found the staff to be just OK. There were many bodies in the lobby, however, I am not sure what they were supposed to be doing. They certainly did not go out of their way for us (ie. opening the door). I think that in order for this property to remain competitive, a significant renovation is required. Given that the hotel market in Toronto is rapidly changing (for the better), competition is going to be as tight as ever. I'm not sure how this property could survive in its current condition.

This is not the Ritz, or the Four Seasons, so don't expect that. I bought a hotel package on hotwire.com and after being notified of what hotel we were given, I immediately checked this hotel on trip advisor. I was a little worried and skeptical when I saw all the negative reviews, but after my experience there, my mind has completely changed. I don't know if I was given a room in a newer part of the hotel, or a room that was just renovated, but I have almost nothing to complain about. Service: Upon check in we were greeted very warmly by two women who immediately upgraded us from our double room, to a king bed suite. We didn't even ask for this, they just did it on their own which was in my opinion, excellent customer service. The lobby was beautiful and all of the staff were very friendly and accommodating, making sure that your every need was met. The Room: Beautiful and clean. Yes, this is an older hotel, however our room was spotless, the beds were very comfortable and we had a nice view from our balcony. We were on the 3rd floor facing east and had no problem with noise from the streets below at night. The rooms are not modern looking, which I was originally worried about after reading about the \"old\" rooms on tripadvisor. What I found was a room that had tons of character and charm, and unlike a room I have stayed in before. It was like a mix of 1930's glam with the modern amenities of today (flat screen tv, upgraded appliances). I really thought the room was very nice, very comfortable, and extremely clean. Like I said before, I don't know if I stayed in a newer area, but nothing about this room was old and dingy. This kind of leads me to believe that some of the rooms are newer and some are older, because I really don't understand how anyone can complain as much as they have if they stayed in the room that I did. Our coffee pot was brand new, still in the plastic, and sheets looked as though they had been untouched by anyone. The bathroom was spotless, which I rarely say about a hotel. I travel often, so I have seen my share of both good and bad hotel/resort rooms. This was certainly a good one. I did not go higher than the floor I was on, so I can't comment on how higher floors looked. Also, there is room service with a huge menu that looked very good. I didn't order any though because it was very expensive. Location: Decent location, however it is a little far from being right downtown ( CN Tower, ACC,etc). It took about 30-35 mins to walk right downtown, but on a nice day it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no problem. This hotel is located right across the street to a Tim Hortons which was nice, and also very close to a huge variety of restaurants such as Sushi places, Shawarma, Cafes, Seafood, Steaks, Sandwiches, etc. Every type of food you could want is within a short walking distance. This hotel is about a 15 min walk to the Eaton Centre. My two complaints: The maids/workers in the morning were extremely loud. They were slamming doors ( hopefully not intentionally) constantly from about 730am until around 10am. I think maybe my room was next to a storage closet because you could hear them go in and out almost by the minute. My other complaint, both the AC and the heating were not working, and neither was the fan. I am the type of person that always sleeps with a fan on for black noise, and was somewhat disappointed to find out these didn't work. For me, I know that if the fan was working it would have blocked some of the noise the staff was making in the morning. Also, you have to pay $25 for parking at the hotel. Just an FYI. Overall, I would definitely stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. Since I am not sure whether or not some of the rooms are more new/upgraded than others, when you book this hotel I would ask to be put in a newer room, just in case.

Our apt. rentals where side by side. When I opened the door to our apt. I was suprised since it looked nothing like the pictures on line. We started looking around. IN the kitchen there was cake or cooke crumbs all over the floor. My husband checked out the bathroom and came back saying that there was some southern hair on the toilet, on floor and hair on tub. At first (after a long travel) it was like ok we will just clean it up and then I said no way man! We are paying for this room, no room cleaning while we stay here and such.--- We left and went and took a look at our compnaions apt room. They had a much bigger room, clean and it was very nice and much updated. That was enough for me. We went to the desk and I wanted to spk w the clerk that checked me in but she did not want to--- so I spoke to the man that was there and I asked that we spk on the side since my point was not to create a problem. Maybe a maid was having a bad day. I told him the issue and so he asked if he could show me something else and go from there. I said sure. We no longer where on the 27th floor but on the 5th floor but when he opened the door I was floored. It was huge suite. I needed a fridge so we go a fridge for free and internet was also includied.

If they had been anywhere near that room or even on the lower balconies they could've clearly heard the noice....I recorded it on my cell phone video & THAT should tell you how loud this party was for well over 1.5 hrs. I said to her that perhaps the Toronto Police needed to look into this then, at which point she put me through to a manager. He was less than sincere, though he did say that they were sorry and would try to address the issue. Only then, did the noise stop. We were able to fall asleep about 4:45am. At check out we were not even asked how our stay was....so I assume that it was not a concern of the hotel's. Needless to say, we will not return.

I'm in the concert touring business and have stayed in this hotel with several different artists (Paul Potts, Franz Ferdinand, The Cult etc). You would be surprised how some of the supposedly more notable big city hotels struggle to cope with the needs of a touring entourage, whose members - band and crew alike - spend anything up to 300 nights a year away from home: but, struggle those hotels do. \"Master Room & Tax Account\" would still appear to be a foreign language to many \"cool\" hotels. Frank Campo and Glenys Lacey, at the hotel, are well versed in the the simplicity of smooth check-in procedures for large groups, yet they still seem to find the time to deal with the detail surrounding individual guest requests. For my part, I recently spent four consecutive nights in Toronto there with the opera singer Paul Potts. With a Japanese tour imminent, my assistant and myself took it upon ourselves reorganise the layout of my already-spacious room, to resemble more of a production office: this didn't phase Frank whatsoever and Glenys even had the porter deliver another desk to the room, to assist with our workload. I'm quite a fan of the Sutton Place group, having spent time in both the Vancouver and Edmonton properties, down through the years. However, the Toronto location (within walking distance of many attractions and the city centre) remains my firm favourite. There's something of a \"days gone by\" feel about the hotel, harking back to an era of impeccable service and understated style. I'm looking forward to going back there soon!

None are perfect but in all my years of reviewing hotels I have never endured what I did at the Sutton Place. Let's start with a minor issue that I was originally willing to overlook. I booked a room for $120 and paid an additional $44.25 for the hotel's \"early-in, late-out\" package, which claims to allow guests to check-in as early as 11am and check-out as late as 2pm. I showed up at 12:30 pm and was told my room wasn't ready. So much for the early check-in that I paid for. Luckily I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a room to be ready...but I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if I had tried to check-in at 11am. Upon getting into my room I immediately placed the 'Do Not Disturb' card on the door handle. I did some photography of the room for my article using the natural light and made some notes about the room and its amenities. I locked my camera gear in the safe, put one of my bags in the closet and left the camera tripod in the corner of the room. I left the room (with the 'Do Not Disturb' card on the door handle) and proceeded to another hotel that I was assigned to review. I did not sleep at the Sutton Place. The next morning I returned to the Sutton Place and discovered that my key-card didn't work. I noticed that the 'Do Not Disturb' sign was gone. Concerned, I returned to the front desk and -- in a show of poor customer service -- was blamed for the card not working. \"You must have had it close to your credit cards or cell phone,\" the clerk said. I returned to the room and entered. My bill, which had been slipped under the door overnight, was on the floor. The room had been inexplicably tidied-up (even though I had left the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the handle) and -- to my horror -- my bag and tripod were gone. Luckily the camera gear that I left in the safe was still there. I called the front desk and a manager called me back quickly. I demanded the return of my belongings and an explanation of why someone ignored the 'Do Not Disturb' sign and entered my room at some point in the night. He promised to investigate and knocked on my door within a few minutes holding my bag and the tripod -- which he said he recovered from housekeeping. He couldn't explain why my belongings had been removed even though the 'Do Not Disturb' sign had been on the door and the room belonged to me until at least 2pm. I was livid. He offered to comp the room (which is literally the very least he could do under the circumstances) and said he would do an audit to find out who made the unauthorized entry into my room and decided to clear it out of my property. Had the camera been missing from the safe I would have called the police. There is no excuse for what happened. The Sutton Place gets a failing grade.

This was shown as a 4 or 4.5 star hotel. I then went on trip advisor and read a number of reviews that made me start regretting my decision to go through hotwire. We booked a queen sized room and didn't realize how small the bed actually was, so we called down to change our room and upgrade to a king size room. They told me that was possible, but it was a $40 upgrade fee. I agreed because not only the bed was small, but the room was rather tiny too. All of the other reviews mentioned how outdated the rooms are - which they were. The rooms were tidy, clean and the bed was comfortable, but the furnishings and phones were very out dated. You can tell this was an extremely nice hotel at one point in time, but is in need of an update badly. Everything about our trip was just \"ok\", it didn't knock my socks off, but it was nothing to complain about - until late at night. We attended a concert and came back to the room a little late and wanted to have a drink in the room out on the balcony and enjoy the city lights. We ordered a bottle of wine and some some beer. Not a few minutes after did I hear someone at the door - thinking that was way to fast for room service - but didn't think much of it - UNTIL SOMEONE WALKED RIGHT INTO OUR ROOM. The hotel staff gave keys to our room out at 1:30am. As you can imagine, both parties was confused and annoyed - so I called down to the front desk. WHen I spoke to the manager - I was told \"it was just a mistake and they were sorry\". Well, after reading a number of other complaints on the website about things gone wrong and no consideration/compensation or anything else accept for an apology was given - I was a little annoyed. I asked the manager specfically if they were planning on doing anything - and he said well hotwire already paid for your room, so I can't refund anything. I said no \"i paid for my room\", but it was purchased through hotwire. He again told me he couldn't do anything. It was only after I was angry on the phone did he agree to comp my room service charge that we just ordered along with the upgrade AND our breakfast charge. After that was agreed upon, I received a phone call telling me they could not comp the wine per Senior Management. First nothing was offered - then what was offered was being taken back. Needless to say, I was even more annoyed, frustrated and angry. After another heated conversation with the manager, he told me not to worry and the charges would be reversed. I was not looking for a handout - but having someone walk into your room at 1:30am was not acceptable - but not evening being offered anything after that happened was simply wrong.

The website shows a well lit, handsomely furnished suite with dark gleaming paneling on the walls, sparkling chandelier, warm study... the reality was far from comforting. The room had an air of disuse, we turned on all the lights but could not dispel that dark, uncomfortable feeling.

The kitchen tap water ran brown, the tap in the ensuite was broken. The water stopped altogether for a few minutes while I was in the shower the following morning!

Not only did they make me feel uncomfortable, but thy never cleaned the room very well, there was dust on the curtains, I found black stains on my duvet, and I even found notes left by previous guests next to the night stand. The bedroom and the parlor room was spacious, but the decor was worn. The white furniture had scuff marks on them and the former wet-bar (no longer stocked) underneath the T.V. in the Bedroom had weird brown-goopy stuff in it. The staff \"solved\" the problem by just locking the cabinet. The phone in the bedroom didn't work, I called the front desk and nothing was done about it. The room had two bathrooms that were small. If they ever renovate this hotel, they need to just make one killer bathroom in their suites. I think it's gross when the shower curtain touches the toilet and when there is little counter space. I also believe it's not a coincidence that they never show pictures of their bathrooms on websites. I think mini fridges definitely need to be added, especially when other hotels in the area such as Windsor Arms, the Intercontinental Yorkville, and the Cosmopolitan include them in all rooms. The HD TV's had remotes that never functioned properly, and it was a pain to change channels. The pool was gross, it had scum around the edges. There wasn't any lights in the pool either. The sliding doors in the pool area that lead out to the balcony/terrace was very cool though. The women's sauna was broken. Room service was overrated. The fruit always looked bad, the eggs Benedict was just average. A litre bottle of water was $7 CAD with a $2 delivery charge and 15% service charge. God forbid you went out and brought back take out food or a bottle of wine, they would charge you to use their silver ware or glasses.

The location is also good because Yonge street is there and you can walk to Dundas Sq. / Eaton Centre in about 15 minutes (or you can be lazy and take the subway)!

Rooms: We stayed in a Sutton Double room which was pleasantly large with nice furniture and decor. However, it was the room we stayed in which caused me to give the review an overall 3 rating rather than a 4. There were several issues which arose within 20 minutes of entering the room. Firstly, we noticed our room used to be part of a connecting room, and so we could hear practically everything being said next door - even what TV show was being watched. On the first night when we were jet-lagged from our 7.5 hour flight, the female in the room next door was arguing with her boyfriend ALL NIGHT so we never got even a wink of sleep. Secondly, the in-room safe did not work (we tried several methods several times) so we ended up calling reception and then about 5 people came to our room to fix one safe??? Anyway so in the end they re-activated it or something and it worked (but it wasted like 30 mins of our evening). And last but not least, our room had a balcony with a really lame view - the roof of floors 1-3 of the hotel - but the view was not the problem. The balcony door did NOT lock! We therefore felt quite unsafe since we were not on a high floor (Thank God we got the safe working). Service: The receptionists were rather efficient and check-in took like 2 minutes. There was also free coffee in the lobby on some mornings - depending on what time you got up. Value: Overall we got a rather good deal on the room as we booked a flight + hotel through expedia.co.uk.

I read the reviews cautiously, hoping others travellers were either totally jaded or given poor on line discounter rooms. I booked on their web site, joined their member club and thought I was homefree to at least a satisfying stay..... I booked a 2 bedroom/2 bath LUXURY suite with a balcony. At check in ( at the very late hour of 3 in the afternoon!) I was told that there were no balcony suites available and that the 2 bath units were all taken by guests checking in earlier. I then asked if we could change to 2 single balcony king rooms and were told, yes, but at a rate nearly double what I had prepaid. No apologies, no attempts to rectify the situation, just glassy eyes. Our luxury suite was a very tired 70's condo style apartment. The carpeting had seen many a party, the furniture was a curious mismash of older traditional hotel furnishings and hideous big box store discounted items. We has 2 flat screen TV's without HD capability. The bathroom was large enough for one small person and adequate if they didn't want to shower. There is no fan and very poor lighting.The shower head was installed sometime during the Carter administration and not only was placed too low for anyone over 5 foot, but sprayed water EVERYWHERE. We were given 2 towels for 4 people. A Mariott Fairfield provides better quantity and quality of toiletries. As a member of their loyalty program I was entitled to free internet - a ridiculous charge of $18 a day , with a non operational business center - this 'privilege was ony 'won' after 2 calls to the desk and a personal visit. The pool and health club area is an insider secret. It is nearly impossible to find ( it is listed as being on the on the third floor, but ris really on the second- insider tip, get off on the 2nd, make a right from the elevator, go to the door ,marked men's by the white piano). The health club is adequate, most of the limited equipment worked. The pool is VERY small and best for a short person who enjoys doing short laps in very cold water. A very nice sunning terrace is off the pool with tables and chaises. Do not attempt to bring your own beverages or food there, even in plastic cups; you will be 'busted' - something that has never happened to me at a true 5 star resort. Summary:Location is central, but not on the pulse of things- its a 15 minute walk to Yorkville and 20+ minute commute downtown. Parking is typically overpriced. Public areas are still quite elegant, but declining. Restaurant is unimaginative and very overpriced ( try the grocer down the block ( Rabbas) for take out and incidentals. Rooms are very overpriced for a dearth of style and service.

I booked two nights, and if I could have gotten my money back and changed hotels, I certainly would have. After using Hotwire several times, I was confident that we would get a beautiful hotel and room, and this is the first time that we have been disappointed. The hotel is located on Bay Street, right downtown. It was a convenient location, with lots of places to go nearby within walking distance. There is underground parking available at the hotel. You can either park yourself, or use a valet. We parked ourselves, and it was $25/night. Not too bad for Toronto. Checking-in was easy, and the ladies at the desk were very nice, and helpful. When we checked-in we were given a room on the third floor, with two double beds. I asked if it were possible to get a room with a King, and was told that the whole hotel was booked and they had nothing available. We went up to our room on the third floor, and it was quite large. Everything was clean, and nicely made up. The view from our room (3018), however, was the roof of another building that went up at an angle. So, it basically looked like we were in a cave. I went into the bathroom, and it was not even as big as my bathroom at home (which isn't saying much!). It was quite cramped. There was no light in the shower, and the curtain was only maybe an inch or so from the ceiling, so when you closed the curtain it also was like being in a cave! And the shower head wasn't very good either. That evening when we went out, we checked with the front desk to see if it would be possible to change rooms the following day. They had another room available on the 10th floor with a Queen bed, so we said we would change to that one. We were planning on being out the following day, so they asked that we have all of our things packed up, and they would move it to our new room while we were out. The ladies at the desk asked that we just come back to the desk when we returned to the hotel, and we could go to our new room and our things would be there for us. That night when we returned, I noticed that I could perfectly hear the conversation the women in the next room were having. If you're looking for a little privacy, this is not the place. The following morning we woke up, and went out for the morning and early afternoon. When we returned we went to the front desk, and got our key cards for the new room. Our luggage had not been taken to our new room as discussed, however, so we had to arrange all of that. The new room with the Queen (1003) was much smaller than the previous one, but at least we could sleep together! The view onto Bay St. was also an improvement. No improvement on the bathroom situation, though. In the evening we went down to the pool. It's quite a bit smaller than other hotel pools I've been to. The water was a little chilly, but we went swimming anyway. A lady with two children came down while we were there, but when they felt the temperature of the water the mother decided it was too cold to go in. The poor little girls were disappointed in that. Off of the pool there is a really nice patio area with lounge chairs and patio tables and chairs. If you are looking for a place to relax, this is a really nice spot. The following morning I was looking forward to enjoying the morning paper, as I had the previous morning, but unfortunately they didn't deliver one. The only thing they left us was the bill for parking. As I said earlier, we have used Hotwire before, and have enjoyed really nice hotels such as Delta and Westin. If I had booked a 3 star, I would have expected something along the lines of Sutton Place. I had booked a 4 star, though, and didn't feel like this hotel was in the same league. It really needs a make-over to come up to parr with other 4 stars. The prices that they ask for normally are a little high for the quality of room you get. I don't even think that the price I paid through Hotwire was much of a deal considering.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cThree Stars at best\u201d", "Author": "holla_eight", "ReviewID": "UR31561412", "Content": "Now to begin we got a deal on the room so my complaint can't be that harsh, however the rooms were no better than the holiday inn, in fact the only thing impressive about this hotel was the lobby everything else just seemed sub-par.

The biggest complaint was the bathroom- so small that two of us could barely brush our teeth at the same time.

But seeing as I got the room for a special rate ($100 CDN per night) through a promotion they were running, my review will be a little kinder. I arrived by myself for one night and then my husband was joining me the next day after work for our second night. He self-parked and said that the lot was underground and that the spaces were a little tight but manageable. It was just nice to have an underground lot, especially since it was pouring rain. It is $25 with full in & out priveledges. If you are coming and going a lot, it might be worth it to pay the $33 for valet. I walked into the hotel and it's gorgeous. They describe it as European Elegance and it's definitely that! You feel like you've just walked into a hotel in Paris. The decor is old but has a lot of charm. Although there was a lineup at the check-in desk, they were very quick and I only had to wait a few minutes. The staff do seem beaten down though. I didn't get many smiles and they were very monotone when they spoke. No one seemed happy to be there. I got to my room, it was a standard room (1 queen) with a balcony. From what I could tell, all the rooms on the east side of the building have balconies and the ones on the west side do not. Now, just so you know, I have NEVER complained at a hotel or restaurant in my life. I am being serious. My husband is the one who usually has a few words if he is unhappy but I avoid confrontation at all costs. Now, saying this, I broke that record with this trip. The first room on the 6th floor, although standard, was still fine... except for the balcony door wouldn't shut properly and the room was freezing. The doors to the balcony are very old. So I went down to the front desk and told them that I needed another room as the door was broken. The girl gave me a look of disbelief which just made me mad but I kept it in. Still, she gave me a new room on the 10th floor. I walked into that, this one was the same standard room but without the balcony. It reeked of smoke. I turned around and went back downstairs. At this point, I am not happy. I am still soaked from the rain, I am dragging 3 bags and one of the elevators was broken. This time, it was the same person who checked me in. I told him the room smelled of smoke and he said \"this is a non smoking hotel\". UGH! I told him that I understand that but the room I just walked into reeked of smoke and although I can't explain how it happened, I need another room as my husband is asthmatic and smoke really bothers him. So he started looking through his computer for a room and finally said \"I will see if there are any bigger rooms available\". You would think that upon the first room not being okay, if they had any upgraded rooms, they would have given it to me. But I really felt like because I got a deal on the room, I was being treated differently. And the silly part is that the promotion for the rate was put on by the hotel, not a travel site. Anyway, he found me a King room also on the 10th floor. This room was perfect - no issues at all. It had a balcony with a door that shut properly and did not have any bad smells. :) The king room is probably 20% bigger than the standard room but does feel much more open. There was a big flatscreen tv (maybe 47 - 50 inches?) and lots of closet space. I thought to be nice, I would call down and thank the man at the desk for the room - but when I did, he didn't seem to care at all. Ok, so Accents Restaurant (in the hotel). I had a friend meet me for dinner, it was 10pm and the restaurant was open until 11pm. I had a coupon for 50% off the food that I had received when I booked the room so we thought we check it out. We went down to the restaurant and it was very fancy. We felt out of place in our jeans but as it wasn't busy, stayed anyway. The host immediately said \"the bar?\" and we said \"no, dinner please\" and he proceeded to look at his watch, say \"oh yes, there's still time I guess\" huff and take us to our table. He seemed upset that we were ordering dinner!!! I had the chicken club and my friend had the fish & chips. My chicken club was awesome! I couldn't finish it so they kindly wrapped up the other half for me. The fish was hand breaded, stacked on a pile of chickpeas and roasted potatoes and there was a homemade tartar sauce poured ontop of it all. I had a bite and it was excellent! I'm not sure if it's worth it for full price though. The full price of the sandwich was $15 and the fish $17. When I gave him the coupon, he seemed very upset. I did tip on the regular amount though which seemed to lift his spirits. I think they are used to people only calculating the tip on the reduced amount. The bed was okay. It's supposed to be some sort of special chiropractic bed. I personally prefer my pillowtop bed I have at home. The next morning, I ordered room service. Had the eggs benedict and it was delicious!! Since I didn't put the card out the morning before, it did take about an hour for my food to arrive but I expected that. If you put the card out, you get delivery of your food at the time you request it. I wasn't going to order interenet to my room but since I had the entire day to kill before my husband was going to arrive, I called down and ordered it for 24 hours. It's $16.50 which is definitely expensive but I do have to say that it was fast! I was able to stream music while playing an online game and never had any problems. And I was accessing it wirelessly. I will say that the benefit to this hotel bar none is the balcony!! You don't get a fantastic view or anything but not a lot of hotels offer balconies and during the afternoon when the sun came out for a bit, I sat out there and enjoyed it. The only downside is that there aren't any chairs out there but the desk chair worked fine for me. The water pressure was no good in the shower but that's to be expected with an older hotel. I did go to the pool - it is a small square pool, deepest point is 1.17 metres. It's still nice if you just want to wade around and relax. I did some laps and that was fine too. Keep in mind that the sauna is turned off so I would recommend turning it on before you get in the pool if you want to have a sauna afterwards. I did check out the workout room and it was quite nice! The final morning, I awoke to our bill that had been slipped under the door - and it was so wrong! They had charged us for 2 nights of valet parking when we only had 1 night of self park. They charged twice for the internet but I only ordered it for 24 hours. They charged me for a long distance phone call when all I did was pick up the phone, dial a number (without the 1 infront) and get the Bell Canada voice telling me to hang up and dial again (so I just used my cell instead). Upon checkout, I gave her the list of items that were wrong and she credited my card. Honestly, if I had paid anymore money, I would have been furious!! We stay in Toronto every year at this time as my husband has a work function. Honestly, I won't stay here again. Too many problems. We had a much better time last year at the Mariott Courtyard over one block.

Booked on Priceline as a 4-Star hotel, for about $100CDN/Night; booking other 4-Star hotels for similar prices in the past. Hoping to do some Christmas shopping over the holidays, we wanted to be downtown. Upon arrival Saturday afternoon, the doorman told me parking was $25/Night with no in/out privileges or $36 a day with full privileges. I went to check in and asked the front desk if there was cheaper parking anywhere? \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No sorry, you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find cheap parking in downtown.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd On the corner of this hotel (Bay / St. Patrick) is the St. Basil Church, where we paid only $17 to park for three days (no in/out privileges)! At least the money went to the local church instead of a hotel chain. (Thanks helpful hotel staff...) The hotel was deserted, and we only saw one other couple during our stay. The lobby was decent but empty, with more hotel staff then guest to serve. The tiles were painted, and although I understand the charm of Victorian d\u00c3\u00a9cor, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a fine line between classy and out-of-date. Unfortunately, this hotel is out of date! For the prices they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re charging, I was disappointed. We got a free room upgrade, which was not a big deal considering the hotel was completely empty. The room we got appeared to be standard, which makes me concerned about what the regular rooms looked like. The room itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t that bad, and served its purpose with a comfortable bed, furniture, and LCD television with lots of additional channels. The bathroom was small, and the top vent connected to the outside. This usually isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal, except we were there during a snow storm and could hear loud winds all night coming from the bathroom. The worst part was that the connection outside caused the bathroom to be freezing cold, with no temperature control to warm it up. The location of Sutton Place is excellent, lots of shopping, restaurants, and we utilized the TTC subway system (www.ttc.ca) to get around ($9 for a day pass: good for couples or entire families on weekends). We loved riding the subway, which was fast, avoided usual traffic, no parking, and the cold weather never affected us. This was the first hotel I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to where I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open my window coverings\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 There is absolutely no view available, with a huge business office across the street on one side and looking into condos only several metres away on the other side. (See pictures of view) I decided to go for a workout on my first morning, which took me forever to find the gym. Listed on the 3rd floor in the elevator, it was nowhere to be found. I wondered down to the 2nd floor, where it was dark and deserted. After wondering through the old hotel like a haunted movie, I found a small run-down workout area, there was no heat, and half the machines didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work. No thanks! So I thought to myself, the pool has to be close\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 And it was, a small square pool that measured about 8m X 8m and at its deepest measured 1.17m, making it more of a large kids pool then anything else. Over dinner, we discussed how long the hotel was going to be operational. Considering they were charging the same prices that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve paid at the Sheraton & Hilton in downtown Toronto, I really don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see how they can compete. And with nobody in a hotel with well over 30 floors, they obviously are not doing well. This hotel is comparable to the Delta Downtown Toronto (only blocks away), which measures 3-Stars. The Delta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prices reflect that quality, and they are always full for such a huge hotel. Perhaps it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time to update the quality of Sutton Place from 4-Stars to 3-Stars, reflecting its out-dated d\u00c3\u00a9cor and average satisfaction rating from everyone.", "Date": "December 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAwesome room!\u201d", "Author": "netgeek", "ReviewID": "UR22230475", "Content": "I was really quite nervous about coming to this hotel after reading the reviews.

The television appeared to be relatively new and had a large, thin LCD screen; it was very nice. Unfortunately, bathrooms are a bit on the small side, but were adequate. We had a room on the lowest floor, with two \"full-sized\" beds (no, not queen size) which were certainly big enough. Room also had a marble-topped wet bar behind doors; this was of no value to us except for the small refrigerator. Generally, with better services and amenities this property could approach a 5* level. I found it odd that the room contained a coffee-maker (located on the dresser), but there was no electrical outlet nearby. Had I wanted to use it, I would have had to carry it into the bathroom - the wet bar also lacked an outlet. The point here is that this amenity was not well implemented and I wonder if this is symptomatic of the way this hotel operates. Another example of poor execuion is to designate my room as \"non-smoking\" but with a connecting door to another room that was apparently \"smoking\". My room smelled fresh at time of check-in, but after a guest checked-in the next day into the adjacent room, my room reeked of cigarette smoke. Here again, assuming the guest was not smoking in a \"non-smoking\" room for over two days, it seems poorly thought-out to have a connecting door between smoking and non-smoking rooms. Location is good, within walking distance to the trendy Yorkville neighborhood. We prefer to use public transportation as much as possible when we visit cities, and the Sutton Place is close to a subway station and a bus route is just outside the front door. We did not use any of the hotel facilities: pool, food & beverage, parking, etc so cannot comment on those. The minimal interactions we had with front desk staff were satisfactory, but we were definitely not impressed by the alleged \"friendliness\" that other posters have noted. Staff provided the bare minimum assistance without elaboration on two occasions, even though there were no other guests at the desk. Not a big deal, but it's one more thing that will keep this hotel from operating in a more upscale market niche.

The bathroom is undersized compared to more modern hotels. Housekeeping seemed to take FOREVER or perhaps my room just happened to be at the end of their rounds?

As far as I'm concerned, she should have said that from the start...\"no, but I'll go grab some for you in the restaurant\". Her tone was snotty until she returned with the napkins. Whatever!

Yet the young woman at the desk (Vida?) patiently worked with Housekeeping to quickly find us a room matching our criteria. The room was fantastic: a huge comfortable 1 bedroom apartment with full kitchen, living room, dining area. enormous separate bedroom and tons of closets. The bed was one of the best our busted up bodies have slept in. We also had our balcony from which to enjoy a week of absolutely beautiful sunrises. The food from Room Service was very good and delivered quickly by friendly people. The Housekeepers on our floor were always helpful and extremely courteous. The location is perfect. Museums, downtown, Kensington Market -- we walked to everything. Nonetheless, cabs, buses and subways are close. When we needed directions to Niagara Falls, the friendly staff gave us a sheet with perfect directions. My wife and I are hard working family people.
