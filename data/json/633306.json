Sarah, the owner, were really helpful to answer our needs through e-mail. The hotel itself is really cute. The pool is not so big but it is clean and really artistic. We choose the Ocean View Villa, okay, it is not really ocean view from your terrace, but you have a view when you have a look from upper room. The building is excellent, the bathroom is nice. The only minus is the aircon is not cold enough for the high ceiling, so the upper bedroom is always warmer as downstairs. The staff are friendly and helpful, the breakfast is great and the restaurant serve delicious food. We spent most of our eating time here. We love the way they serve 'sate ayam', it is cute :)The beach is full with fishing boats, so it is not so convenient for bathing. But the local people are friendly. Overall, we love Life in Amed and would not hesitate to reccommended it to others.", "Date": "Oct 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR134165084", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "lady_mermaid"}, {"Content": "Loved Life in Amed       cottage", "Date": "Sep 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR907428242", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kedaabby"}, {"Content": "Other Folks Overrate This Place Life in Amed is fine. The garden is lovely, and the big, pricey bungalow by the sea has nice furniture and a fantastic view. But the regular bungalows are quite dark, the food and massages are lousy, and when you leave, the staff will hit you with small and heretofore unmentioned charged for using the computer or the snorkel.

We moved to this hotel after our first hotel, Blue Moon Villas, ended up not being quite what we'd hoped (see separate review).The reviews below are spot on - this is a special hotel with a wonderful staff. They catered to all of our needs with patient smiles. Susie at the front desk is a real gem and helped us arrange snorkeling trips etc while we were there.We had a marvelous dinner at Sails' just up th road (I can't say enough about that restaurant - and the view! WOW!), and snorkeled the Japanese wreck, which seems to be a must-do but we found disappointing. The snorkeling on the beach at Life in Amed was some of the best we experienced in Bali - clear water, great coral and fish. We saw these amazing blue starfish out about 200 feet from the shore - amazing. The only downside is that the ladies who give massage are a bit too aggressive.... they literally sit on the beach and come up to you immediately when you open the door to your villa Massage today? How about tomorrow? When you leave?? They reminded me a bit of seagulls sitting on the beach. We did avail of their services and they give a good massage. But as soon as the massage was over how about massage tomorrow? later today? They need to survive and make money, but they need to tone it down... other guests mentioned the same thing to us.But I don't want that to detract - go to Life... you'll be happy you did!", "Date": "Aug 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR544256976", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lucyandethel"}, {"Content": "A Magical Place -- 1 of the Best in Bali! We traveled all over Bali and this place holds a special place in our hearts. Not only is it elegant but it is magical and the staff couldn't be more accomodating.The rooms are gorgeous, all with 2 levels and traditional Bali touches and open air showers that are great (walled so there is privacy). We stayed in the direct beachfront unit with a bedroom upstairs, one downstairs, a living room and a huge outdoor bathroom with big tub and shower, too (for about $100US). Other rooms are half that but not quite as big (but still with a living area and 2 floors).There was a frig and t.v. and white water views that couldn't get better. The rooms had A/C. The pool is nice and our kids loved it.Booking was easy. We arranged it by phone directly with the property and they even called us to confirm and had our room waiting and all kinds of staff waiting to help us with our bags.Breakfast was a la carte but included, so you ordered whatever you fancied, and it was delicious and well-done with hearty tropical fruit smoothies included. Dinner and lunch were excellent, too, and we ate every meal there.Snorkeling straight out the door was truly amazing and it was the first time our 5 year old ever went. Incredible tropical fish and living coral reefs. We loved it! The sand is fine and gray and the water is turquoise and filled with gorgeous marine life.The hotel staff looked after our baby so we could go snorkeling, let our kids play the traditional instruments (there was also live Balinese music at night) and let us use their internet to check email. They helped us arrange a ferry trip to Lombok. The manager even gave our child a mini-ride on his motorbike (just in the parking lot).They also arranged for two women to come give us massages after our children were asleep for an amazing price.We did explore some other places in Amed and even all over Bali, and it just doesn't get better than this! The place is owned by a Californian and run by the sweetest Balinese couple you could imagine and all of the staff are just as nice and helpful. The grounds are beautiful with manicured lawns, traditional Balinese doors and sculptures, fountains and comfortable furnishings. Truly, Life in Amed feels like a different, enchanted reality when you are there.", "Date": "Aug 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR675951090", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BookAngel"}, {"Content": "Loved Life in Amed       The pool", "Date": "Jun 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR886621172", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "esmeLiverpool"}, {"Content": "Great little place, very quiet, lovely retreat       One of the two ginger kittens!", "Date": "Jun 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR983370412", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PMH2317"}, {"Content": "Lovely little place       The resturant", "Date": "Feb 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR446615041", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "saesae"}, {"Content": "A little lodge in the village Just got back from a 3 night stay at Life Amed. The traveling party consisted of 3 families, each with kids (ranging from 7 months old to 12 years old).Life Amed is a charming property located right smack in the middle of a fishing village. Overall, it is a great value. My husband, toddler, nanny and me stayed at the most basic villa (king bed downstairs and 2 twins in the loft) for USD70 per night. This is inclusive of a decent breakfast (selection of french toast, eggs, fried rice, pancake, and coffee/tea/fruit), service and tax. Now, the details.The good:-As mentioned above....the value. The restaurant was also very affordable. I remember a plate of rice with bbq chicken was rp 35,000. The food was decent, but is a bit bland for my taste. We all agreed that the Western food tasted better than the local selection.-The staff was super duper nice and quite efficient. I mentioned a creaking bathroom door, and they fixed it in a timely manner. We were sitting down by a bale at night, and someone brought those incense sticks to drive away the mosquitoes. -The atmosphere inside the compound is charming and laidback. You feel like you are vacationing at someone's holiday compound rather at a hotel. -There is a shallow pool for little kids and a bigger pool for the adults. -Right next to the beach. The kids get to play with the sand, watch the jukung boats. And at lowtide in the afternoon, we looked for crabs, seasnails etc on the beach. The not so good:-The location. The back of the property borders a village. This in itself is fine. But, the villagers literally sit in front of the hotel, facing you. It's just odd to lounge around on a reclining pool chair when there is someone 2 meters away staring at you.-We heard dogs barking away at 11pm and 4-5am. Not every night. And not everybody was affected. But the one night that it happened, our 2 year old stayed up between 4-5am. Not great. We went to Blue Moon and Anda Amed for dinners as well. Both had more fancy and slightly better food and better view (since they are located on the other side of the street and are on a hill). This means however, there were a lot of stairs to climb up and down. With little kids, we much preferred Life Amed.Overall though, I loved our visit to the area. It is quiet and beautiful. The drive from Denpasar was filled with beautiful vistas, especially the last 1 hour. Just gorgeous.", "Date": "Aug 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR116208350", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "pigletthepug"}, {"Content": "Seaside Views and Village Tranquility", "Date": "May 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR753969077", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mjcasta"}, {"Content": "Love LIFE AMED       amed life pool and grounds", "Date": "Nov 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR752446382", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Shine13"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608478-d633306-r22738210-Life_in_Amed_Boutique_Hotel-Amed_Bali.html", "HotelID": "633306", "Price": "$107"}}
