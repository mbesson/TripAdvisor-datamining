Not for folks who want to lounge around in the hotel all day but very serviceable for the majority who want to see the sights and have a quiet, safe, clean base to return too.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NETHERLANDS", "Title": "\u201cDo not even consider to stay here\u201d", "Author": "JAY119", "ReviewID": "UR86346902", "Content": "The worst experience ever!!!! I made a last minute booking for 2 nights and I paid 20% of deposit at the time of reservation. Upon arrival, a woman - I assume she was the owner or a manager - told me the room that was supposed to be mine had got a broken toilet so that she could not let me stay in her property. She called another person who also owns a B&B nearby and asked him to take me to his. Unfortunately, his B&B was full that night. She and he were talking in Italian for a while and finally she told me tha he would show me another one which is run by nuns and very clean and nice. It was already 9PM, so I just followed him. The manager of Al Gran Veliero waved at me and that was it. The nuns place was....just....OH, MY GOD. I refused to stay the night and found myself another hotel room. I phoned the hotel booking agency that I booked Al Gran Veliero B&B through and asked to cancel the booking as they failed to give me a room that was confirmed. 3weeks later, I'm still waiting for my refund as the B&B does not approve it. First, they let people book a room in their property no matter they are capable to take care of the guests or not. Second, they charge certain amount as a deposit for booking and even if they did not accomodate the guests, they do not return the money back. Third, if there is a refund request or complaint via other agencies, they simply ignore pretending they do not have anyone who can communicate in English. Stay away from this B&B unless you want to have a \"unforgetable memory\" in Rome for the rest of your life.", "Date": "November 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmington, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cA good choice for the independent traveler\u201d", "Author": "travelfreak53", "ReviewID": "UR49143916", "Content": "We stayed two nights at the Al Gran Veliero B&B this October. We wanted a cheap hotel, close to the Stazione Termini and this place met our needs just fine. This is not a situation for a traveler who wants consistent support by a hotel staff, because there is none! We had to tell them when we made our reservation what time we expected to arrive. We had to look carefully for the building because there is no sign outside. We buzzed to get in and a woman was in the office. She took our money and explained the key system (five different keys for the different entrances and interior doors.) She took us to our rooms and that was the last we saw of anyone affiliated with the place. The rooms were clean and orderly, with a little fridge and a flat screen tv. The bathroom was tiny....we had to step into the shower to close the door to the bathroom. It too was spotlessly clean. A previous review mentioned the towels; granted they were mismatched and obviously air-dryed, but for the price, I'm not complaining! The location was ideal for us, a five minute walk from the station. We were also able to walk to the Colosseum in about 15 minutes. The breakfast was provided at a restaurant around the corner; we were able to have a cappucino and brioche to start our days. It's not an unlimited breakfast buffet, but it was sufficient to get us started. We were also close to a couple of nice restaurants where we were able to get dinner after our long days of touring around. All in all, I would stay here again. The one inconvenience was that we were unable to leave our luggage there for the 1/2 day we were touring around before our 14:00 train. We had to pay to leave them at the train station and it would have been nice to have been able to leave them at the hotel, as is usual. Except for that, I found this to be a perfectly acceptable lodging solution for the budget traveler.", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Al Gran Veliero Bed and Breakfast", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d646329-Reviews-Al_Gran_Veliero_Bed_and_Breakfast-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$73 - $125*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "646329", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3f/89/3f892fa8127b7406538ff0dedd5424421large.jpg"}}
