{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great value - Have booked to return! It's a fact of life: there is no pleasing some people. Our stay at the Ambassador was very pleasant and great value for money. The location was fine - it was nice to walk off dinner returning to the hotel from restaurants downtown. The location was handy to all buses we even walked to Ala Moana Shopping Center, Ward Center and Diamond Head from here.Some reception staff were very friendly and helpful - just couldn't do enough for us. Greeted us with a genuine smile every time. Some other staff .... well, how friendly are you at work? Not that they were rude in any way.During our stay the foyer was under reconstruction. This was carried out in a well co-ordinated manner. I welcome the improvements being made (with minimum interruption) other people may choose to whine about any minor inconvenience.The standard suite room was h - u - g - e. Furnishings and kitchen somewhat dated but fully functional. Beds comfortable, daily cleaning was fine. The garbage trucks were a bit noisy early in the morning but the reality is, hotels generate trash which needs to be collected. Name a hotel in Waikiki which does not use this service.The pool was basic but fine. Nice to cool off or lie around. Business Center was handy for internet access.A few tips for Waikiki while I have your attention:Frozen mac choc coffee at Vintage Coffee Stand Ala Moana (excellent sandwiches from sandwich bar 15 steps from there).REAL Frozen smoothies at the back of International Markets (just add a shot of Malibu to the pina colada)$20 for a 4 day Oahu bus pass available at ABC shops.Beach fries with ranch dressing at Dukes Go to Moose McGillycuddy's for excellent great value breakfasts / food. Half price vouchers for this and many other deals available in This Week in Oahu and similar booklets free in street stands.Excellent meals at The Cheesecake Factory though hard to get a Sunday Brunch which was not sweet.For the ULTIMATE romantic fine dining - Hano Hano room top level of Sheraton Hotel.Oh .... and did I mention staying at the Ambassador?", "Date": "Jan 8, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR111579344", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "PoppyPete"}, {"Content": "Parking charge criticism Our one major criticism, besides having no free wi-fi, is that the hotel charges a lot for parking. While it's fairly easy to find street parking at night after cruising around a bit, we think the hotel should provide FREE PARKING to guests, as their huge parking lot is often empty! Even if they were to provide FREE PARKING to guests staying 5-nites or more, or even charging less/per day, we think that would be more aloha of them. As it was, seeing an almost empty parking lot was tragic. Economically, the hotel should smarten up; they could be making a little more money from charging guests $5/day, instead of making nothing when they charge $15/day. At that rate, we were willing to cruise 5 minutes to find street parking.We've stayed at the Ambassador several times over the years and enjoy our stay, because of the value, and as others say, it's well-located, clean, no-frills and has a friendly staff. Also, the hotel is located on one of the few two-way streets in Waikiki. This is a plus when you are driving, or having people pick you up at the hotel. It's easy to find and access.We recommend the rooms on the higher floors, and like the one-bedroom corner suites, as they are very spacious and have huge bathrooms and closets. The showers are small, but the water pressure is ok. The towels and linens are budget quality, but they don't pretend to be a 4-star hotel. The elevator works fairly fast. We like the open-air corridors design of this old, concrete hotel.We only hope the hotel reassesses their parking policy.

What a mistake. Not sure where to start so I'll start at the beginning. After spending 20+ hours traveling to Hawaii we finally got to our hotel. We got to our room and even though I booked a king bed we were stuck with two twin beds. Secondly we were right next to the elevator (DING all night long); third the A/C unit was extremely noisy AND had a bucket underneath it on the balcony to catch all the water dripping from it. I called the front desk to complain and was told that's the only room available and the beds are not guaranteed. Not the grand honeymoon we were expecting. We stayed one night there and luckily our travel agent booked us into the Ohana east for only $10 more a night. What a difference. The ambassador is at least a 30 minute walk to the international market place and everything else worth seeing.

So, in preparation I hit the Internet to search for what I thought would be a near impossibility - a cheap hotel in Waikiki. Imagine my surprise then when I found this place. Pessimist that I am, I expected to have problems or meet a real let down, but nothing could be farther from the truth. The front desk was friendly (and the women good looking, especially the shorter one in the Hawaiian dress!), the rooms were clean and large, and parking was right on the premises. Being directionally challenged myself, the front desk workers were helpful with directions, even giving me the location of the local Wal-Mart (which, by the way, had the best price on Macadamias anywhere on the Islands). Washers/dryers are available on premises, and the hotel is in the heart of everything and plenty of shopping, food, and fun within walking distance. I don't see how you can go wrong with this place.

It's an older building with a modest decor, but for what we paid we felt we got a great deal. We got a room on the 7th floor which is great for the views. We recommend getting a room with a kitchen, it's a huge life savor. (The hallway to the rooms are exposed, so you get a nice view and breeze...) Our room was spacious, and clean and had everything we needed. The room didn't have a coffee maker but there was a great coffee shop in the lobby where we got our morning latte and pastry. Staff was courteous and check-in and check-out was fast and friendly. If you prefer resorts then this might not be your place. I prefer to spend my money on other things while on my trip, sometimes the hotel is just a place to lay my head at night.

We had stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court (across the street from Ambassador) on two previous trips, also booked through PH for about the same money. Our 2nd fl room at the Ambassador was a more spacious than Maile's room, and we had a pseudo-kitchenette (counter/ sink, cabinets, and fridge, but no coffee machine or microwave) but we were put into a room w/ 2 doubles and would've had to pay to upgrade for a room w/ a king bed instead of two double bed. Both places are no frills, cheap, clean lodging, which is fine since you'll spend most of your time out-n-about. Our biggest complaint was the ridiculously loud trash trucks or tour buses that came by at 5am every morning hauling or loading something that caused a loud ruckus and had to back up to do it, making even more noise with the back-up beeping alerts! Not once did I hear those noises while staying at Maile, which is literally across the street! We wouldn't have minded an obnoxious wake up call like that at 7 am since we would have been up anyways, but 5 am is a little too early for that much noise! Since Ohana is a chain of hotels in Hawaii, we think they're a little more attentive to detail and have more options as far as rooms go. We asked several times about changing our room due to the noise and bedding option but the front desk was not very helpful with either complaints.The only reason for the low rating is that for the same money, you can do a lot better by staying at Maile Sky Court. These are your basic no-frills hotel rooms and you can expect to get what you pay for... clean room, clean sheets, a place to rinse off the sand/salt and sleep.

Honolulu is just loaded with cheap hotel rooms but your mileage can vary A LOT! Last trip over I had stayed at the Park Shore, but I took a chance on the lower internet rate at the Ambassador, scared of what I might find! I was pleasantly surprised. The internet rate lands you a room on the lower three floors, and while I was a little concerned with street noise, the window coverings were very adequate, and noise was not an issue. As other reviews have stated, this is an older building, and there is nothing about it that is vacation-like. It is: A hotel. What was so nice was the cleanliness that was maintained along with a larger room; Perfect for a business trip like I was on. The staff was more than jovial and helpful. The parking was $9/day, reasonable for Waikiki. As always I suggest, if renting a car, get the smallest one available: Waikiki parking spots are tiny by mainland standards. The location of this property is close enough to the action if you want that, and yet near to the park at Fort Durussey (sp) and the elegance at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. One other nice little detail: if you wanted to go to the Hard Rock, it's easy walking distance. Same with the Convention Center. There are essentially no on-site amenities with the exception of the pool, small, but again, very nice and clean. As a business traveler I am extremely keen on clean and water pressure in the shower. Both of these expectations were met, and very nicely I might add. I'm sure this is why this older budget hotel receives three stars on the web and not 2 1/2 or less. By the way their little shampoo bottles? I loved their brand! If you need breakfast, you can walk around the corner to the (attached) Thai Restaurant which serves a budget breakfast with open air dining. If you need good Kona Coffee and pastry, there is a shop just outside the door, and if you forgot toiletries, there is an ABC store attached - of course there is one ABC store for every three tourists in Waikik. There is also a TGIF just accross the street at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. I can recomend this hotel for anyone who gets ill over paying $150 or more a night for a hotel while on vacation. It is a very well maintained property.  If this is a once in a lifetime vacation I would say two things: number one, skip Ohau and get yourself over to the other islands (Kauai is my favorite) and number two: if you are making Waikiki your destination and want a memorable Hotel experience, bite the bullet and pay for the Hilton Hawaiian Village or Halekulani experience. Remember: Honolulu is a very large metropolis with nearly a million people.

(Ambassador Waikiki was great) My wife and I stayed here In May 2004 on a rock-bottom priced tour (less than $400 RT from Japan incl three nights hotel and airport transfers. The place was great--and I don't just mean for a discount hotel.For reference, we were in a room in the Ewa Tower on the 8th Floor. Microwave, dishes/cups for two, fridge, iron/board, safety box in room (abt $3 day paid at front desk upon checkout). Everything was clean and well ordered. Window faced wall several meters away. Hotel exterior includes laticed brick so indoor hallways have a breeze blowing through and feel like outdoor halls, not stuffy. Room was as large as at Sher Waik, but no lanai, of course.Front desk staff always helpful, one or two not very cheerful but all definitely very helpful, as was housekeeping. Dollar rent-a-car nextdoor, Keo's fabulous Thai Restaurant adjacent to ground floor (becomes a full-menu American-style breakfast house until noon at Denny's prices). Well-stocked convenience store also adjacent. If renting a car this location spares you the drive through Waikiki, so you can head right out towards the freeway for a drive around the island or out to shopping destinations.Not a brand-new hotel, but we never saw the conditions others described.

The paint was peeling off the walls, the carpet was filthy, only a small bare light bulb over the sink in the bathroom. The TV did not work - all stations were nothing but snow. There was one station that one could see if you could see through the snow and the wavy white lines. We told the front office people twice about this and both times they promised that it would be fixed but it never was. Our wakeup call each morning was at 5 a.m. with the noise of delivery trucks, slamming of doors, and the annoying beep, beep, beep sound that trucks make when they back up. Just as we were about to go back to sleep, it would start all over again. We asked to be moved to an other room but they would not accomodate us. This was the worst place we have ever stayed at. We also had trouble with the parking key they gave us to get out of the parking lot - the one you insert that lifts the gate handle up. This happened three times that the gates would not open. We had to push the assistance buzzer. The third time it happened my husband pushed the assistance buzzer but no one would respond.
