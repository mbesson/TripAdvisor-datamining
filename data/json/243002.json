I was greeted by a very friendly receptionist who gave me all the information on the hotel, and of the surrounding areas of the hotel. There is a lift in the hotel so getting the bag to the room was no problem, the room its self was sufficient with a on suite bathroom (no bath only an open shower), a tea/coffee making area, flat screen TV (which the reception ask a five pound deposit for the use of the remote control, during your stay. I said no to that option, when I looked at the TV I found the manual controls on the side of the TV as well as the on/off switch), I had a single room (but it had two single beds in it), a telephone and one chair. The room was very clean, and a maintenance man came round and fixed some lights. Which I take the previous occupant had reported, there was the bar of small soap and shampoo in the bathroom. I managed to get the room for thirty five pounds including continental breakfast which consisted of tea or coffee, toast or bread, with spreads or cheese and three different cereals and hot or cold milk. The full price of the room was 90 pound plus, at that price I would have hoped for a better breakfast as the other hotels I have stayed at over the years in London have done better breakfasts. But for the price I got the room for, and being central (Earls court underground station at the end of the road) I think overall it was a valve for money and I got a good night\u2019s sleep with no noise.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hunter,Ohio", "Title": "\u201cAll that's needed and value too\u201d", "Author": "stillmrscalabash", "ReviewID": "UR123262590", "Content": "Exactly what we needed, no more, and certainly no less.

The hotel is located quite close to the Tube (~5 min walk to Earl's Court) which is convenient especially for those travelers coming from Heathrow as it's directly on the Piccadilly line. The surrounding area seems nice enough. The hotel itself is located on a quiet and safe-looking street, and the area around the Tube looks like it sees quite a bit of tourists, as there are several exchange bureaus and other hotels. I did read reviews for the hotel beforehand (which I always recommend!!) so I pretty much found the hotel to be what I expected. The receptionist that greeted us was helpful and friendly. Another receptionist we dealt with was equally helpful - we had to leave very early in the morning to catch a 5am train to Paris, so she booked us a cab in advance, taking care to inquire about how much luggage we had and how big of a cab we needed. We stayed in a triple room, which was one twin bed and one double bed. The room is very tiny and with 3 suitcases, there wasn't much space to move around, but keep in mind that London is a very populous city, and for the price you're paying, you can't possibly expect the room to be sized like an American hotel room. The bathroom was also small, but adequate, with only a shower, no bathtub, and I found everything to be clean. It is true that there is no TV remote in the room, though we didn't try to watch TV. There's no AC and if you open the window, you will get some noise from the surrounding buildings. During one night, there was a England football game going on and quite a bit of shouting from the neighbors, but I found that to be a cultural charm. Breakfast is included in the price, and is pretty typical of European hotel breakfasts, with bread, toast, ham, cheese, cereal, etc. The breakfast room is really tiny so it can get quite crowded. I stayed on the 4th floor and was unable to pick up a wireless access, but I did get a signal downstairs. Wireless is free.

We checked in we went down to our room (in the basement). I typically don't expect all that much from a hotel but this room costs my friends and I $625 for two nights........ which seemed WAY over-priced. The room was set up with 4 single beds and had less than 1 foot (.3 meters) between the beds. Very cramped for a room that cost as much as it did each night. Now if this was a Hostel, I would have understood, but it wasn't and I was very disappointed. Something that I must add that was a large disappointment was in the evenings how loud it was. I sleep through nearly anything and everything and I woke-up on a few occasions throughout the night because of loud drunks outside. In-fact we even at one point has someone throw a half full soda bottle at our window. Others in the hotel yelled out the window to tell people to shut-up but we never addressed it in that manner. One of my friends is a very light sleeper and was up all night because of people screaming and swearing. Completely disappointed in this behavior. A few good things about the hotel was that it included a Continental breakfast, the front desk personnel were very helpful, the public transportation was about 5 min walk (Earls Court tube), and there was a local grocery store close by to pick up things we had forgotten. The breakfast was very basic and included bread, cheese, butter, jam, some dry cereal, boiled eggs, orange juice, tea and coffee. Very basic but suitable. The personnel working at the front desk were very helpful - to the extent of check-in my friends and I in on-line to our flight, and provided very helpful information when inquiring. The public transportation (Earls Court tube) was only about a 5 min walk and easy to get to from the hotel but was approximately a 20 min ride to Waterloo (London Eye) area. All in all the hotel just seemed to be too over-priced for not being located closer to downtown London area and the size of the room.

The steps down are indeed steep and the lift (worked fine) was on the wrong side of the building, so we would have had to go through the breakfast-room, which was closed... So down the steep stairs it was. When we opened the door to the room, we almost hit the wall on the other side, it was that small!

The breakfastroom is pretty small, and when many people came at once, it was a minor chaos. Really good service though, I think there was atleast 3 women constantly bringin new bread, juice etc. The actual breakfast consisted of toast, cereals, eggs, cheese, jam, milk, two kinds of juices and tea/coffee. Being included in the price, it was absolutely fine, but nothing special. The housekeeping was a different matter, sometimes they didn\u00b4t leave new towels (ran out), and they came in despite I\u00b4d told them not to.

When I mention this to the hotel they said it was because I use the bathroom and glass...Can you believe this??? I ask for another room and they refuse. If you look for an hotel in london not too expensive I suggest THE ROYAL NATIONAL. 100% BETTER.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cbad memory...\u201d", "Author": "Kenlosangeles", "ReviewID": "UR5877158", "Content": "I don't recommend this hotel because they will send you to another hotel. I booked this hotel for 2 nights by contacting the hotel directly. The stuff was friendly through emails, so I was excited to stay at this hotel and I and my mother went to the hotel on the date we booked. The stuff then said there are NO ROOM available, and told us to go to another hotel nearby. We walked kind a far with my mother with pain on her thigh, and found that the other hotel is very very tiny and dirty...... We called back to Westbury and said that I want to cancel this reservation since this is wrong, and the stuff said \"then come back here, we have room\" !!. I didn't think my mother could walk back to Westbury, so we said so and canceled the booking. After I come back from the trip, I found out they charged for one night since I canceled after check in time. I booked another hotel and that was awsome, but it put bad impression on my whole trip to London. I don't think everyone would go through this, however this hotel is doing bad business and I don't recommend this hotel.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne,Australia", "Title": "\u201chorrid\u201d", "Author": "TravellingRookelbury", "ReviewID": "UR5435700", "Content": "We booked this hotel over the internet. It sounded reasonable and was fairly cheap (90 pounds for a quad room). When we got to the hotel we were all a bit horrified at how decrepit it looked. It was worse inside, narrow stairs, no lift, bags of dirty linen in the hallway and pieces of plywood nailed over holes in the walls and extremely hot and stuffy (no air conditioning). The room was not bad, we could at least walk between the beds. The only room for our luggage was in the cupboard and we had to take one case out at a time in order to get to our clothes. The television didn't work and it wasn't replaced until the next day. The second television worked but it still wasn't a clear picture. The best part was when we were leaving., the woman at the front desk and a man whose main job seemed to be sitting in the foyer and watching television decided to have a huge argument in front of us in a foreign language.
