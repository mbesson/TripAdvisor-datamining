I asked reception for another pillow - took a while to explain what a pillow was - and I guess she didn't understand because the pillow never did turn up. I went to reception to ask about it but after queueing for 15 minutes I just gave up. Service in the restaurant was hit and miss. Some staff were really good and on-the-ball but some didn't seem to know what they were doing. We noticed a lot of inconsistencies between the 2 nights we stayed and ate in the restaurant. Food in the restaurant was ok in the evening - meat was lovely but vegetables were cooked too far in advance and were mushy. Breakfast was terrible - fried egg was rock solid, bacon was nice, sausages were cheap and greasy and beans were stone cold. Room was spacious considering the location being in central London. Cleanliness was ok just about everywhere - although I didn't look too closely. Air conditioning unit was very, very noisy though and kept waking us up.

We were pleased to see that there was a full size computer in the lobby which we used constantly. The charge for the computer was 5pounds for one hour or 3pounds for half an hour. They had a buffet breakfast which was included in our package. The buffet consisted of a full cooked breakfast and also continental including fruit, cheese, yoghurts, pasteries, cereals etc. etc. If you would like omelettes they would cook them on request. We wanted cream with our coffee (rather than the milk they seem to use in their coffees) and that was no problem at all. We found the breakfast staff attentive and helpful you just had to ask and they would provide! There were plenty of free newspapers in the lobby every day so you didn't have to buy them. One tip re general travel in London. We purchased London Transport Travel tickets before we left Canada for 50pounds per week. These tickets cost a lot less if you purchase outside the UK. These tickets covered all six zones on light trains, underground trains, trams, buses.and meant that you could hop on and off all forms of transport with ease. It also eliminated the long line ups. You have to request them well in advance from your travel agent as the actual tickets are sent in the mail.

A more accurate name would be HI Bond Street (as Bond Street station is closer) or HI Debenhams (as the store is close by)! It is in the part of London better known for its medical specialists (Harley Street area). The hotel is part of an older terrace. Our room was on the 3rd floor, quiet and clean. It was a little small but more than met our requirements. One nice touch is that the wardrobe had double wall-to-ceiling mirrors on the doors. The HI had the new HI logo, meaning that it had been enhanced above normal HI levels. This was largely true, though the TV was an old-fashioned CRT type with few stations - BBC1, BBC2, ITV1, C4 and Five, also Sky Sports 1/2/3, Sky Sports News and Sky News. I believe newer HIs have more choice, so perhaps these will come.

The menu was excellent and one could get just about anything. Also on Marylebone - Starbucks and a Barclays ATM (no charge for Bank of America customers, btw). For dinner or lunch near the hotel, try James Street - burgers and sweet potato fries were really good at Gorilla Burger and Made In Italy had terrific pizza and salads. Also Selfridges Department Store has an extensive food section where you can get drinks, fruit, desserts, sliced meats and cheeses, bread, etc, although pricey.

That is Holiday Inn in London. We reserved 2 rooms for 5 nights in Holiday Inn Oxford Circus. We are apalled at the abysmal service levels from the hotel. The reception needs atleast 5-6 reminders for any request, often sends in wrong bills and threatens to charge the same to us, the duty manager and the reservations manager are not available for 3 days at a stretch... and to add to it receptionists known nothing and can't help at all. A surprising fact - one orders room service and upon cash payments - the change never comes back. Those serving decide to stay back with the change ranging from 1 - 4 pounds and not return the same. And this took place 3 times. I am surprised if the hotel is equipped to handle guests who come to London for pleasure. Its definitely not a pleasure putting up with such a hotel and its arrogant staff ( especially front office, reception). Can't blame the managers because they chose to talk through the receptionists only. To share honest feedback about the dirty hotel rooms and service levels, we wanted to meet the manager. To our surprise, no manager was available from Friday until Monday. Even on Tuesday - Wednesday - we made repeat attempts to meet but the receptionist finally told us that they cannot allow us to meet the manager as every one is in meeting. What a fantastic customer service ! We travel a lot and stay in many countries. This is first time we saw such pathetic conditions in a Holiday Inn hotel. One must visit India, Germany to see Holiday Inn standards. Its epitome of best customer service & great comfort in India and is amongst noted 5 star hotels. But we saw a old - poorly maintained property in Holiday Inn Oxford Circus- London. The breakfast restaurant stinks of food and egg, same breakfast menu for all the 6 mornings that we were present - bad hygiene. The experience leaves us with lot of disappointments. While my organization has made a decision not to stay any more with Holiday Inn but my purpose of writing this mail to bring to your notice the current status. We incidentally also stayed few days in Holiday Inn - Aerial ( Near Heathrow) during this trip. While the hotel looked like a budget hotel but everything else was just great. May be this feedback lands up in the right desk or the right bin, but i am making an attempt to convey an honest feedback. Its up to the people to take it up or discard it totally. ** I am also conveying my feedback to the GTA travel agency/ Kaleidoscope through which i booked.

My only complaint would be housekeeping - they clearly wanted to get in our room, get it cleaned & go home so despite the 'Do Not Disturb' sign they tried to get in about 9am but failed as we had the safety chain on.

I booked this room in Feb 09 and you would have thought it was early enought to get a good room. The room we got 173 was right over the reception and entrance and so it was noisey. The next morning I asked the girl at reception if we could change and she was friendlier than our experience previous night. We got moved to room 273 which was only one floor up, which wasn't too bad. But for anyone booking I would suggest you ask for a room at back of hotel, as road can be noisey. The room was compact, but it was clean and ensuite was fine. We didn't spend too much time in room as we were out shopping and sightseeing and only came back to room to change to go out in the evening. The breakfast was good with a good selection.

Reception area well set out, bar/tourist information by the reception desk. We were allocated a twin room on third floor (room 390), the corridor outside our room smelt of mildew or something similar. There was an ice dispenser at the end of our corridor, which came in helpful for keeping drinks cool. Room was larger than anticipated - and was pleasantly surprised. Probably about 10 foot high walls, plenty of space to move around in. Furnishings were a little tired, and the ceiling paper was showing signs of damage, but all in all a comfortable room. View of private flats opposite (I had requested a quiet room), Good aircon, double glazing and windows opened if required. Puzzled by the fact the room had an ashtray even though it was non-smoking. No mini bar in room, but room did have a safe. Bathroom was small, but a full length bath and good water pressure on shower and bath. Bathroom toiletries more holiday express than holiday inn (ie lux shower gel and shampoo combined in one dispenser on wall). Enough wardrobe space for a couple of nights (small single wardrobe). Had problems with the room next to us making far too much noise far too late at night, but one call to the duty manager sorted that out, which I appreciated grately. Breakfast was OK on Saturday at 945 am, but barely warm bacon. Asked straight away if wanted tea/Coffee, and the pot was on my table by the time I came back from getting fresh fruit. Sunday at 0830 much better. and hotter items. Wide variety of choice, and you can ask for eggs done another way if you don't like scrambled/fried. Evening meal which was included was actually a carvery/self service, starter of salad or soup, main course plenty of choice for meat eaters, (lamb/beef, canelloni, beef pie, beef mince, chicken in a white wine sauce) less so for veggies (1 dish of a stuffed aubergine). You could go back for as much as you like. We went for our meal at 630pm, and there was no one else there, the waiting staff kept their distance, and I didn't feel as though they were rushing us. I asked a waiter why it was so empty and he said it got busier after 8pm. Desserts were not so interesting (cheesecake, chocolate torte, fresh fruit salad, icecream). There is an ASK just around the corner from the hotel if you fancy Pizza/Pasta/Italian. But it is hard to beat the location for the price. The location is nearer Bond St station than Oxford circus, behind Debenhams, on a quietish road.

In-room Internet connection is very important for me, so before booking - I verified that the hotel provides it. Room was fairly small and a single room means a single bed, which is not what I had expected. Don't expect any interesting views, as the location is a back street and nothing like Oxford Circus, as the name suggests. I paid 12.5 GBP for 24 hours Internet connection, but guess what - as soon as you enter the room - the WiFi signal drops from 100% at the corridor to 0 to 50% inside the room. So I couldn't really connect unless I located the laptop on the floor next to the door, which is not a decent way to surf. Staff was not very friendly or helpful about it. Reception told me they would call me back in 10 minutes, but never called or did it after half an hour. They tried to give me another room, but it was at the smelly smoking floor and it had the same problem. It turns out that I'm not the first guest to complain about low (or no) signal in the room and I consider this as providing misleading information, saying that the hotel provides in-room Internet access, if many of the rooms suffer bad signal.", "Date": "December 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel\u201d", "Author": "lynsayk", "ReviewID": "UR11517952", "Content": "My daughter and I visited London to see a stage show and stayed at this hotel.

Hotel itself adequate - 5 minutes walk from Selfridges and Bond Street tube. Small frontage, through revolving doors to find a small reception desk with a bar area to the right. The restaurant is downstairs - small but comfortable but I imagine could be very warm. There is one lift so waits could be lengthy. Our room was fairly good - as there were 3 of us we had a room with 2 double beds - I believe most rooms only have 1 bed. Decor was a little scruffy - paper scraped off walls etc, but clean. Bathroom was tiny but looked as though it had been refurbed recently. Air con was very efficient. Badly let down by staff! The reception staff didn't seem to care about the guests at all. We arrived early, checked in and asked to leave our luggage. The concierge (I assume that's what he was, but he only seemed to appear when luggage was around) told us to follow him to a room full of cases and told us to leave our things in a space. He said we didn't need a receipt. When we returned alte afternoon the receptionist called for the concierge on an intercom. 15 minutes later and 2 more calls we were still waiting. When the guy eventually turned up he again led us to the room and told us to help ourselves - he obviously hadn't a clue which cases were ours. I would certainly not have left our things had I known this. Breakfast was similarly poor service. There was a small continental and hot selection, all self service, but trying to attract a waiter to get coffee took an age, even though there were plenty of staff there. It was the same each morning. On our last evening we needed clean towels, and despite being told 3 times by reception that they were 'on their way' it took over an hour to get them. Our check out was fine, but we had noticed on other days that if more than one party was checking in/out at a time there was a significant delay. It was a disappointing visit - we have stayed in several Holiday Inns and have never had such poor service.
