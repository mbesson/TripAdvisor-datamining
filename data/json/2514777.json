Hotel des Arts in a convenient location, nearest metro stops are Abesses and Pigalle, within walking distance of Sacre Coeur and lots of local bars/restaurants. My only negative comment would be the poor breakfast which you have to pay an extra 7 EUR per person, it's all cold stuff with jams etc. Do not pay for this as there are lots of boulangeries a walk down the hill and there's a Broiche D'Or down the hill next to the Pigalle metro where you can eat a set breakfast eg. hot drink, hot baguette & sweet pastry sitting in. Also, more value for money is going up L'Arc du Triomphe - 360 view and La Defense - wonderful glass elevator and large shopping centre too, not Eiffel Tower.", "Date": "January 17, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Residence des Arts", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d197429-Reviews-Hotel_Residence_des_Arts-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$207 - $381*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">14 Rue Git Le Coeur</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Latin Quarter</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75006</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2514777", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a8/71/a8711dee01e0508b77309fcdfb13275e5large.jpg"}}
