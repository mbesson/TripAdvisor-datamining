If you are coming through flight, Terravision as well as other buses run every half an hour or so for all the airports from the station. Rome is a beautiful city which is also very rich in historical monuments and attractions and almost every tourist attraction is at walkable distance from this hotel. We stayed there for 5 days and took Subway (Metro) just once while going to Vatican City, rest of the places like Colossium, Roman Forum, Trevi, Pentheon etc can be reached by walking. The locality was very safe even at late night. We returned at 1am on two nights still felt very safe. Hotel: Room was of just sufficient size, and clean. There was a wardrobe with electronic safe. Bathroom was also average sized with basic toiletries. The staff knew good english. Hotel's breakfast selection was one of the best and most vast I have ever seen. Cereals, toast, fruits, beverages, meat.. everything was there. Air-Conditioning was perfect - although we visited Rome in the scorching heat of August, still the AC was sufficient to cool it down to a temp where you would feel the need of douvet. Internet was very expensive (\u00a34/hour) so we didnt use that. But still I will rate the service as \"poor\" because we had a broken shower that would throw water in every direction while in use and would wet everyhing like floor, mirrors, clothes, toiletries, etc. We complained about it the very first morning, but it didnt get repaired for the next 4 DAYS!! Although they did something to reduced the breakage, but still it would squirt water in all directions and spoil the whole bathroom floor. That problem kind of kept ruining our experience for 5 days. Nearby: Because it is so close to City Center, there are lots of restaurants just 2 minute away from the Hotel (especially infront of the Train Station) and they serve delicious, fresh, authentic Italian food at reasonable prices. Other services/shops close to the Hotel are: Bicycle, Scooter rentals, shops selling tourist guides/tickets, internet cafes, flea market etc. Conclusion: Excellent location, average sized rooms & bathroom, amazing breakfast and in case you don't face any problem like the one I have mentioned above, you will enjoy the stay!", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cService was excellent\u201d", "Author": "Stephenfamilyofsix", "ReviewID": "UR123191959", "Content": "We were booked to stay in Augusta Lucilla for two nights at the end of our Italy trip. We chose the hotel as some friends were also staying there. Upon arrival at the front desk our reservation was for the following evening and night after, not for our first night. To make matters worse there were no rooms available to accommodate six of us. After some discussion and review, it became very obvious that I had made a mistake with the dates. Promptly the desk staff jumped into action and contacted nearby hotels and negotiated two rooms for us to stay in at the same rate. The porter also helped us move our luggage to a hotel 100 metres down the road. As our friends were staying there, we were also invited to have breakfast with them in the hotel despite now staying elsewhere. Unlike some of the recent reviews regarding poor service our first experience was excellent, in fact above the call of duty. Anyway we finally got to stay in the hotel for our second night. The triple rooms were small for three people. Our room was facing an internal stairwell. Not a good view but was much quieter then the rooms we had the kids in, as it was facing the street. There was an issue with the hot water in both rooms however it was resolved after an hour or so. Our flight was not until early evening so we asked for late check out (6PM) and for 40 Euro\u2019s extra, one room was made available. There was also no request made to pay for the second night despite my booking error. The hotel is in a very convenient area. Close to the Termini and plenty of restaurants nearby.

The neighborhood is touristy full of small hotels, so I imagine it's relatively well-policed. Our double room on the top floor was very modern, with a sparkling bathroom and working A/C. However, it was extremely small (not uncommon for Italy) -- there was just enough room to walk around the bed and not much more. We did not encounter any problems with noise at night. The hotel staff was helpful, providing maps and making calls to museums for reservations. Their attitude was very much a down-to-business one, though, so don't expect to be greeted with warm smiles and inquiries about your stay. The dining room was large, with many breakfast options -- sliced meats, eggs, croissants, juice, yogurt, fruit salad, etc. The pastries were sometimes burnt and much of the fruit obviously came from a can. You're not going to be blown away by breakfast, but it's edible and can hold you over. (Also on the subject of food: Don't expect too much from the restaurants in the immediate vicinity -- they cater to tourists and the food is subpar.) There is a charge for using Wi-fi.

This hotel offered a good price for a four-person room in Rome, but its location is what sold me. And the maps didn't lie. This hotel--even with two small children in tow--is truly only two minutes from the Termini metro station. An additional minute gets you into the Termini building itself. Why is this useful? 1) Rome's two metro lines only cross here. And 2) there is a taxi stop and a bus station hub at Termini. Let me also join the fray in heartily agreeing with everyone that this is a solid 3-star, not a 4-star, but with modest 3-star pricing, were you really expecting a 4-star? As for the breakfast, I have to say that the breakfast should be evaluated by European standards. This is a European hotel, after all. In the breakfast room, you'll hear many Italians, a LOT of Spaniards, some French-speakers and Eastern Europeans and only a smattering of English-speakers. You'll notice that the Europeans seem to be enjoying their breakfast just fine. They understand that to get a latte, they have to mix the very thick almost syrupy black coffee with the milk (conveniently kept hot for you in a boiler) in a carafe and take it to their table. Also, why would you expect your bacon to be cooked American style (crispy) at a non-American hotel? *Tip*: If the coffee bothers you that much and you don't want to make your own latte, you can nicely ask the breakfast-room attendant to make you a cappuccino at the professional coffee machine in the bar, as at least one Spanish family did every morning. ;o) But if you ask her for a latte, she'll just point you to the coffee and milk dispensers. What you get at this hotel: * Perfect location--quiet--and less than 5 minutes to Termini. This is also a l10-minute walk from Santa Maria Maggiore, one of the major churches of Rome. You could also walk to the Colosseum and Roman Forum in 20 minutes or so, but the metro is so convenient and inexpensive. There are also oodles of excellent restaurants in the adjacent street--Via Principe. * A quiet room, with walls that are padded and fabric-lined, making for a peaceful night. * Breakfast included. Although some reviewers were less pleased with this feature, our four-person family found something to eat every morning. And if you set your standards to a European Continental breakfast, you'll find many choices. * Friendly staff. * A minibar that you can use to keep something small cold if you move things around. * A safe in your room. What you will NOT get: * Free Internet access--in fact, a 1-hour access code will cost you 5 euro. * A business center with a printer. Although there is a single terminal for which you can purchase access. * An in-house restaurant for lunch or dinner. * A gym. * A pool. * Easy parking--at least not that I could see. But this is the hotel for a group intending to make full use of the public transport system, which is not as extensive as some other European cities' but certainly one of the most affordable. Overall, the location is tough to beat. Especially with small children who don't want to walk long to the metro or to dinner. And the price was tough to top in that neighborhood as well.

Getting from the airport (fuimicini-spelt wrong probably sorry :) ) we got a 8 euro bus, which took about 45 minutes but was comfy enough and the cheapest option, findin the bus stop was interesting at the tuourist info office were rude and un helpful and as of every thing else in rome it was not well sign posted (serious map skills are needed in rome) the bus stops right next to termini station. on the way back we took the train, very comfy and at 11 euros it was quick at only 30 mins (non stop) and also departed ontime.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not 4 stars\u201d", "Author": "Vierdank", "ReviewID": "UR57899522", "Content": "I can't really understand all the very positive reviews of this hotel.

Location is great. An easy walk to Termini. We walked to most venues. It is situated down a side street that runs parallel to a main street ( Carvour ??) that runs straight down to the Forum area. Easy access to subway thru the Termini. There is a market store in the lower level of the Termini where you can grabs some water, snacks etc. and many restaurants nearby. We liked \"il Tavolinetto\" restaurant on 46 via D'Azeglio # 46. Go out Hotel entrance , turn left and walk to the next corner ( 50 meters?) and it is right on the corner. The hotel is clean, and quiet and near many other hotels. The rooms are modern and well furnished but I would agree with a previous writer about the smaill showers. Not a problem..but smaller than North American standards. Staff were friendly and reactive to any request we made. Breakfast is ok. We found that the bacon was almost never cooked well and we found that in two other Italian hotels so it must be a custom on how to cook bacon. Otherwise, you can get a reasonably filling breakfast to allow you to start your day. We returned late evening each night and always walked to the hotel. A quiet street, but never felt uneasy. We would recommend the Augusta and would certainly stay there again on our next visit especially since we now know how close it is to many attractions if you don't mind walking. In hindsight, we should have probably taken the hop-on, hop-off bus and the subway more often so as to spend more time at the attractions but we love to explore the side streest etc. and meet many interesting people and find little \"treasures\" of places and restaurants that would not be found by many tourists.

There was a lovely bathroom with an even lovelier shower but no bath. My fault laid in the breakfast. Lack of fresh fruit - meant we actually bought our own and took it into the breakfast room. The daily choice of Tinner Fruit Salad, Tinned Pineapple Rings and Ring Prunes/Plums was just not nice. There were plastic packets of the thinnest cheese imaginable - and you often had to fight with the plastic to get the cheese out. There were a selection of rolls, breads and pastries but we found that the baskets a bit off-pointing as they over-hung the bacon hot plates. There was a corn flake which were not corn flakes, natural yoghurt and some dried up cake. There was ample supply of water for teas and a nice selection of teas, plus coffee and hot milk. The hotel was in a good location - 5 minutes to the railyway station and metro - though we walked most places. The Colissium is about 20 minute walk away, and the main shopping street about 15 - once you get your bearings. The hotel was located in what I can only call a hotel neighbourhood as every other building seemed to be a hotel - some which appeared nicer than ours, some worse. There were some restaurants in the area but these all seemed to close by 11 pm. We arrived 10ish on Wednesday evening, and thought we'd get a bite in the neighbourhood as we were hungrey - nothing was open. We walked back to the station - nothing open. We then went back to the hotel and ordered some teas at the bar. We couldn't charge out hotel account as it was a separate entity from the hotel, and they only took cash too. There was a restaurant in the hotel - where one took breakfast - which I can honestly say I never saw anyone eat in. The staff appeared friendly - but never really acknowledged you as you and went on your way - day or night. They all spoke relatively OK English. Just watch the step leading to the staircase and lift. Tripped up on it a few times as it was quite a shallow step and not indicated. I have no complaints about this as such - breakfast withstanding - but I thought we did pay too much money for a 4 nights stay.

He then preceded to laugh at me when I said that this was not stated on the website and that I was not happy about the situation. To top it all off when we were checking out he was even ruder saying that we needed to pay the balance. We were under the impression that we had prepaid and since it did not state either way whether we had I asked could I use their internet to check my online banking to see if it had been charged. He again stared blankly at me and raised his shoulders in the now all too familiar gesture of 'I am not going to help you at all so why do you keep expecting me to?'. I was welcome to use the internet as long as I paid for the privilege. For a finish he didn't charge me as I was staring to get quite irate and asking to see the manager.

The cleaners tried to come into our room at nine in the morning and then never came back to clean the room after we had left but that's happened in so many hotels I wouldn't hold that against them.

I must compliment the hotel on its friendly and helpful atmosphere. First, location: We found the hotel to be a great location and excellent value for money. The hotel is located about 5 mins walk from the railway station (10 mins from the platform that goes to Rome Airport). This was incredibly convenient when arriving at FCO as we simply got the train into Rome and then walked to the hotel. Out of the station, go right up the hill and then turn left past just where the tourist buses all stop. Tip: There is a SPAR shop as you leave the station which has bottles of water for 0.39E rather than the 2.99E they are everywhere tourist corner shop. The hotel was kind enough to allow us to drop our bags early, enabling us to explore Rome. This exploration is helped by the tourist bus stop at the end of the street the hotel is on. (Don't worry - it's a small side street and little traffic goes by the hotel). You can get a open top bus pass for 2 days which will help with easy access down into the heart of Rome. For some reason some bus tours were twice as expensive as others - we choose the cheapest and it did everything the others did - the route is the same for all of them, they all give headphones to listen to the recorded tour guide. Proximity to the station also means quick access to the subway. In the evening, if you want more convenience and lower price travel than a taxi, the subway is a quick way to get to various parts of Rome (but not all of it). One evening though, we walked to the Colosseum and back directly - it was pleasant and didn't take as long as we thought it would - about 20 minutes each way. Note: the subway only takes cash. The breakfast was included in our rate and the hotel provided a large selection of food covering different countries food. I think they did a great job of ensuring everyone would find something they liked. The desk staff were friendly and helpful. We were joking with them as we came and went. They made us smile while being efficient at their jobs too. Other Rome tips - rather than buying lots of water, you can refill bottles from fountains all around the city. SPAR stores are tucked away hidden out of sight for the locals to use, but are much better value than the tourist stores that are on every corner. At restaurants, try and engage in Italian.

I'm glad I forked over some extra cash to stay here instead of the usual backpacker's hostel. Getting to the hotel took a little bit of walking as I had no map and was relying on finding via Massimo d'aglezio. Let me simplify directions, as they are not well described on the hotel website: after taking the express train from Fiumucino Airport to Termini, take the exit onto Piazza Cinquecentro. Walk past the white taxis waiting at the stand, then down the plaza's left side, past the Termini Subway station and the bus stop. After about a minute and a half, toward the end of the plaza you'll see some luggage salesmen and a pharmacy and pizza/gelato store. Look up and you'll see the road going off to the left and a sign above for via d'Aglezio. Turn left here and walk 2 blocks and the hotel is on your left. Once there, I was delighted to be able to check in to my room well ahead of the check-in time--after a sleepless night at London Gatwick, this was a great perk. The room was spacious, impeccably clean, and well appointed. The only English TV channel was CNN international, which was a bit disappointing but I wasn't in Rome for the tv. The bathroom was clean with a warm shower. Comfortable, if firm, bed. The breakfast is included in the stay, and was great--I enjoyed the scrambled eggs, the croissants (though a tad hard compared to those in France!) and some wonderful coffee. After weeks of hostel \"breakfast,\" this was a real treat. The location around the hotel is a tad quiet and somewhat dodgy but it must be said that even the best parts of Rome are somewhat dodgy. However, the convenience to Termini metro station is unmatched--it literally took a minute to walk to the train, both the A and B lines. From there, the Colosseum, Spanish Steps (the most convenient metro stop for the city center attractions like Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, etc), and Vatican City were just minutes away. After exhausting mornings exploring the ruins or the winding streets and piazzas, you will be very glad that the hotel gave you both a great breakfast and is so close to Termini, you can take a mid-day break, drop off your shopping bags, and regroup for the evening visits. The front desk staff spoke great English and were able to give helpful advice about what to visit in the city. The bar is open til midnight but is not really worth your time--perhaps a quiet nightcap but you're better off having a drink at a cafe before heading back to the hotel. All in all, I could not have asked for a better place to stay (for my modest budget, anyway) to finish my trip through Europe. Clean, quiet, comfortable, and in a wonderfully accessible location--if these are things you value, the Augusta Lucilla Palace should be high on your list of prospective Roman hotels.

We booked directly with the hotel having obtained a cheaper quote directly (240 euro for 2 nights - double room). The booking was made around 6 weeks in advance. As a comparison, lastminute.com offered the same type of room at the time of booking for \u00a3360 - almost twice the price! The location was excellent if arriving at Termini station, it is less than 5 minutes walk. The hotel is situated on a quiet(ish) side road and has recently been refurbished. The foyer of the hotel is simple but clean and the front desk well staffed and friendly (for Rome!) There is a breakfast room on the ground floor but no restaurant in the hotel. Personally I found the breakfast to be fine for a continental breakfast with plenty of selection and satisfactory enough to keep me going with a until the next cafe was reached! To be honest, if you want a luxurious breakfast and exquisite cappucino in your hotel rather than experiencing the best Rome has to offer, then this place is probably not for you! The room on the third floor was spacious with a large bathroom and shower cubicle (no bath). Our view looked over the street but was quiet most mornings and evenings. Room was large with a small sofa/table area, large wardrobe, fridge and large double bed. The tv is a small flatscreen but there is far too much to do in Rome to watch tv in the hotel! I thought the price and quality of the room was excellent for a short trip. I find this 'side' of Termini station much more appealling for a short stay and very convenient. There are some great little restaurants and trattoria's a short walk from the hotel as well as all the local buses to take you all over Rome and run until 00:30hrs.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bottesford", "Title": "\u201cnice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "TheTruth12", "ReviewID": "UR21474044", "Content": "The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the main train station , there are plenty of resturants near the hotel .

The hotel is situated on a quiet road, so there was no trouble with noise. There isn't really much of an atmosphere in this part of Rome however and finding a happening spot to have a drink in the evening involved a journey. Nearby there are couple of good restaurants - I can recommend la Gallina Bianca, which seemed popular with the locals and Cotto Ristorante, which is very trendy with excellent service. The hotel itself I thought was quite pricey - 120 pounds per night for what we got. The room was small, with a monitor-sized flat screen TV. There was a mini-bar. The bathroom was clean and both the room and bathroom were well decorated with everything in good working order. I understand the hotel is in the process of creating roof-top bar, but I don't know when that will be finished.

The \"king-size\" bed was a touch short and quite firm, but my 6'4\" husband settled for having his feet hang off the end. The individual room air conditioning was EXCELLENT. After two very busy, hot days touring Roma in early September, our room felt great! The bathroom was new, clean, and a good size(especially for Europe). The continental breakfast spread seemed standard for Italy, but with no warm offerings. Service was attentive. Internet access was steep, so we didn't use it. Might have been nice to have, but we were OK without. The TV was small but we never turned it on - too much to see and do outside the room! The tiled hallway was a little noisy, but we only heard a few doors closing in the late evening, not during the night. However, we are sure our neighbors \"appreciated\" us rolling our bags down the hallway at 6 in the morning when we left. :) Location, location, location! Just two short blocks from the Termini, we LOVED the quick access to the metro, busses and train - all easy to use in Rome. In the late evening, when we returned to our room, we'd open the window for a bit and listen to the music and singing from the trattorias around the corner. Nice touch.

Some of the destinations you can reach easely just walking, and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. One thing though: the breakfast is tasteless, with few options, bad juice (awfull, in fact), at the level of a 2 star hotel.

The young man behind the desk said that it was \"A four star hotel, much better than this one\". The ALP was very closeby, in the next block infact and very smart it was too. It had obviously just been completely refurbished and there was still work being done at the front. We were given a double room on the second floor. There are two lifts as well as the stairs. As with many hotel rooms in Rome (as in Paris and London too) it was on the small side - enough room for a double bed, wardrobe, desk, minibar etc. However it was beautifully appointed with fabric covered walls and good quality fittings. The en-suite shower room was excellent too. There was an efficient air conditioning system and double glazed windows to keep out most of the city noise, although this is a fairly quiet street. There is also a flat screen TV; the only English language channel was CNN News if that sort of thing is important to you. Breakfast was included but this was very average. It is becoming a worrying trend that many hotels in Europe seem to have settled for the same bland breakfast fare. Reconstituted fruit juices, tasteless coffee, processed cheese slices, tinned fruit segments and \"draught\" yoghurt. There was however plenty of cereal, bread, croissants, cakes and cold meats to compensate. The breakfast was no better, but no worse that in those hotels in wich we have stayed over the past two or three years. Shame really! The hotel staff are very helpful and all speak good English. The ALP is in an excellent location, close to the Stazione Termini (10 mins walk) and close to Metro/bus/tram routes that will take you all over the city and beyond. The area has many bars and restaurants all offering good food. Some are better value than others. When in Rome NEVER order without looking at a menu or price list. If you do sit down and then decide it's too expensive just get up and leave - it's the done thing! Generally speaking the establishments next to the major sites are the dearest so go up a side street or two to find cheaper (and usually better) fare.
