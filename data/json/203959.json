We were even introduced to the manager and with being a hotel of this size we felt even more like royals but later found out that the manager a Mr Torigiani is always this friendly with his guests, congragulations keep up the good work and hope to be back next year,this time I will treat my wife.R  L Burrows", "Date": "Sep 7, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR377665763", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "rabu"}, {"Content": "Brendan/Globus need to delete this hotel On a nine-day tour, this was the only hotel that was disappointing. The dinner and the breakfast buffet were dismal, at best. Although we were warned by our tour guide that the food was not very good. The rooms were shabby and the walls were so thin you could hear every word spoken in the adjoining rooms. The furniture, furnishings, toiletries, towels, etc. were very cheap. Out of a group of 37, most of our travelers complained about the beds being so hard it was difficult to sleep. The icing on the cake was when a big bug crawled across my bed and woke me up in the middle of the night. On a brighter note, the staff was very helpful and professional.

We stayed at the Raffaello Hotel as part of our Globus tour. The room and bathroom size were adequate. There was mold in the shower but there's probably mold in my shower at home.

It was obivous that our room was a smoking one, although there were no ashes left behind, just the stale smell of smoke. Please note that in April, there is no air conditioning (the temps were in the 70's) and your room key placed in the slot on the wall beside the door, turns on the lights. The breakfast provided was okay but the group dinner provided by the hotel was very blah. It was like an Americanized version of Italian food. We were in Tuscany, we wanted real Tuscan food! In sum, the food was disappointing. The hotel is some distance from the historical center of Florence. Some people in our group took the bus as the center of town was not walkable.

I thought breakfast was fairly adequate and the staff was nice as well. I think the Raffaello must be inexpensive for a 4 star which is why Carrani put us there. The reason it's probably less expensive is because it's not near the historical part of Florence at all which is sad.
