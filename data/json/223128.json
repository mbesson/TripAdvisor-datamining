That makes it convenient to the French Quarter action, but removed enough to be very quiet. There are several restaurants within a few blocks, and there are Walgreens and CVS stores within 2 blocks for convenience items. I didn't notice this the first night, but for our second stay, the bed was rock hard and terribly uncomfortable. Combined with the 5am false fire alarm (stuff happens, no big deal), it made for a very poor night of rest. While I'm complaining, I'll mention the annoying elevators. The \"door held open too long\" beep literally starts after about 1 second. Also, on at least one occasion, the doors would not heed the \"door open\" button and nearly closed on a child. The cab ride to and from the cruise terminal is comfortably brief, but slightly pricey ($7 per person for 4 people) for such a short ride. While not an overwhelmingly special hotel, the combination of price and location earn it high overall marks. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars due to the second poor night (especially the bed).

I love the intimate vibe of the Renaissance with it being an upscale chain of boutique hotels: big city amenities with a small town vibe. I knew what we were getting when I booked a \"small room\" at the Pere Marquette in New Orleans but I figured since we would be at JazzFest all day a small room would be fine. In actuality it was fine even though the room was probably 11 x 15. We couldn't open two doors at the same time, ie, if the closet door was open we couldn't open the bathroom door. But, being nit-picky, I do have some minor complaints: 1. There was bad Internet and TV service in the hotel rooms. As a matter of policy I do not believe it's appropriate to charge $19 per day for Internet service but it's even more outrageous when the Internet doesn't work! There was a basketball playoff game one evening but the TV cable wasn't working so we only saw some colorful images on the TV. 2. Trash can? Is there any reason a hotel can't afford to put TWO trash cans in the room--one for the bathroom and one in the room? 3. Towels! I'm a staunch conservationist but when I'm paying $290 per night for a hotel room I do want plenty of clean towels. I had to request additional towels every single day I was at this hotel. Sorry but 2 bath towels, one hand towel, and one face cloth do not cut it in New Orleans. We are morning shower people and after a full day in the heat and dust at JazzFest I really need a shower before dinner. That's 4 towels a day which was dang near impossible to get. And that's it. Room service was good, quick, and fairly reasonably priced. The front desk receptionist was a font of knowledge.

It is just one block from Bourbon Street and 2 blocks from St. Charles Ave, allowing you to easily walk to all of the fun things to do and see, but far enough away from the Mardi Gras festivities that you can sleep in peace (when ever you decide sleep becomes necessary in this crazy city). My only gripe would be that the on-site parking lot was pretty expensive- $35/night, and they charged us extra for being parked there during an \"event\" (a Mardi Gras parade on Canal St), even though we'd had the car parked there for 2 straight days without ever using it once.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Stay\u201d", "Author": "Stephie_Pie", "ReviewID": "UR124756642", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel.

My king-sized bed was comfy, and there were adequate electrical outlets for all of my electric doodads. There's a TV, desk, kinda old-looking easy chair, and a coffee maker, mini fridge, and safe in the cabinet under the TV. The room I was in wasn't the biggest room I've ever been in, but hey, by New York standards it was pretty large! Did not feel cramped at all, I'd guess it was 'average sized'. And now a word about the bathroom! I liked that it was spacious (and clean!). There wasn't a tub, but a small shower stall. The neatest thing I thought was that the shower head was on a rail that went up-and-down, so it could be adjusted for height, in addition to pivoting all about.

Beyond the front desk there's a retro-decorated, stylish bar that was busy every night, a plush lobby, coffee bar, and the well-reviewed Mila restaurant.

Internet is wired only and expensive, but in the lobby it's free wifi that's the fastest hotel internet I've ever seen. The furniture was adequate but nothing special. The window looked out on a colorfully-lit swimming pool. Everything was clean and in good condition. I liked the framed photo of a New Orleans front door featuring my room number. The friendly concierge told me there's one in every room. Nice 4-star touch! Room service was reasonably priced with an interesting menu. The concierge answered my questions about the city quickly and accurately. It's a convenient location but not lively - the downtown financial district is almost ghostly quiet at night, but just a short walk from Canal & Bourbon. Some of the rooms are oddly shaped due to the triangular layout of the hotel building. My room had the TV in an alcove that was not visible from the desk. But the solid building is quiet and I rarely heard any noise at all from inside or outside. In the neighborhood I walked past some truly glitzy hotel palaces, like the nearby rich-relative J.W.

There are better hotel choices including the Renaissance Arts on Tchoupitoulas. The location of the Pere Marquette on Common Street is convenient, just two blocks down to Royal, turn left and you're at perhaps the nicest entry point into the Quarter. However, Common Street is thick with traffic and dark due to the looming tall buildings. As a result the foyer has a cave-like quality to it. I found the front desk staff indifferent but efficient enough I suppose... just not particularly friendly. The concierge was poorly informed, telling one in my group that the Katrina museum in the Quarter was open and free, only to learn after a walk into the Quarter that the museum was closed for the holidays and that there would have been an admission charge. Milo, the restaurant, suffered from the same cave-like, chilly ambience that characterized the foyer. The wait service was checkered. One morning the wait for breakfast was so long that the manager finally appeared, apologetic, and gave us a couple breakfasts on the house. Perhaps the worst aspect of our stay was the parking. The wait for our vehicle was at least 15 minutes and we had to be physically there to call for it. This was the worst parking service of any hotel I have ever stayed at in New Orleans, and I've stayed at a fair number. The hotel isn't awful. The rooms are quiet, but don't expect a view.

I am very glad that I did. I arrived on a Monday for a business trip and stayed through Wednesday. The bar was very nice and was running a Monday night football beer special and it is hard to not love $5 draft beers. I read a lot of complaints about Renaissance bars, but I really enjoyed this one. Parking in NOLA is hard and expensive and the valet parking at the Pere Marquette was no exception. It does have unlimited access to your car, however, the staff which ran the valet was SLOW. Definitely order your car early and then double check that they are working to retrieve the car. Rooms were nice and very Renaissance. My room was an ADA room. I did not ask for it, and I chose not to get moved. Normally I do not like the ADA rooms if there are standard ones available. I just find the rooms to large and empty for all of the access they create. My largest pet peeve with Renaissance hotels, which I did not realize seems to be the rule, is the no room wifi. They have free LAN connected internet if you are a rewards member, however, no wifi. They do have wifi in the lobby. I like to sit in the recliner or on the bed or on the couch while I work. I am not always confined to the desk by their one meter LAN cable. Oh, I had to have my billing corrected as it was charged on my final bill. No problem getting it dropped off. I did not use the restaurant as I love going out to eat in NOLA and the restaurant just looked expensive and not that different. Location! The location is super convenient for the French Quarter (one block off of Canal). That was the reason for my last minute change and I am very glad that I did seek the change. I would stay here again next time with no hesitation. Hit the bar, I think that you will be surprised at how nice it is and reasonably priced.

This hotel only has expensive (fee: $32.48) valet parking and the valets were milling around not doing much when I inquired as to the hold up. The one I spoke with said they needed to move the cars. He said something to another guy who was just standing around at the valet window and magically they got in the cars and started taking them upstairs to the parking. We waited just another couple minutes for them to get the cars out of the way so we could enter the parking area and get out. Once inside, the lobby, we loved the four (I think it was 4) vignettes they have set up across from the MiLa Bar. They were very inviting and cozy (though we did not have time to partake). Check in was a breeze and the two ladies were very pleasant. Upon arriving at our room, we found it quite chilly! The temp was down to 68 degrees - but that was easily fixed. The bed was very comfortable, but their small pillows left much to be desired. The bathroom was very large with a nice walk-in shower. There was no problem with two of us using the sink & mirror at the same time. The side panel on the shower did leak at the bottom onto the floor, but it was not a huge issue. There was absolutely no view out our window. We were on the 14th floor and could not even see the street because the building next door was so close - all we could see was into their windows - so we just kept the sheers closed. Upon leaving, we had another round with the valet. It took them nearly fifteen minutes to retrieve our car!

Weather for this time of year is unsettled and there was rain & sun every day which only added to the 'moodiness' and allure as long as you had an umbrella. The hotel location was ideal for walks within the French Quarter, Warehouse and Central business districts as there are many excellent galleries and restaurants. Walking around the area you could tell that a massive amount of renovation had taken place as most buildings were recently upgraded, painted, redone or all even the unsavory ones.

We told her that it never came and within 5 minutes there was someone at our door.

Marriott) were available through AAA.com. Described as a boutique hotel, it had a hip, artistic lobby with bar and Starbucks, but it wasn't overly \"boutique\" in that snobby way I've seen in \"boutique\" hotels in other cities. We arrived by car just before the start of a Saturday night Mardi Gras parade, and streets were blocked, and the parking garage entrance was blocked-- we had to run out to the parking valet to get him to move the pylons. Mardi Gras stresses most every hotel and restaurant especially downtown, and some services were irregular to unavailable. For example, the parking valet came through for us by going to get the bellman's cart and acting as a bellman since no bellman was available. The room was nice, not tiny, as I expected from the word \"boutique.\" The bathroom was huge compared to the room, with tasteful marble-tile floors, huge mirror, and shower (no bath) with a handheld shower head. Water was hot, but shower pressure minimal. Good, comfortable King bed, with a warm comforter. Small refrigerator in the room which wasn't working. The hotel is located in a good spot, 1 block off Canal Street, around the corner from the Roosevelt Hotel (and its famous Sazerac Bar and Domenica restaurant), and a good family-owned sushi bar, Yokohama, across the street. That said, downtown New Orleans, like other downtowns, is lively, and New Orleans likes its police sirens-- especially during Mardi Gras season. Note on Mardi Gras: If you have a car, you're not going anywhere during the parade or just before or after. Even getting across Canal Street into the French Quarter by foot may be impossible since parades come down St. Charles and turn onto Canal, and you can't cross the police barricades. On Mardi Gras morning we had to take a cab from the hotel, onto the interstate and around to the back end of the French Quarter to meet friends. The cabs are reasonably priced, though, so it's often worth taking a cab, especially if you don't know your way or if it's late. A highly rated restaurant, Mila, is in the P\u00c3\u00a8re Marquette, but we were told it was closed over the weekend (not clear if this was every weekend, but very strange for Mardi Gras weekend). 1/2 block away at the corner is an all-night convenience store, Brother's, where you can buy fried chicken and fries all night.

You get the best of both worlds - good close-by location, without being the middle of the melee. The hotel is a great mix of old-school NOLA charm and modern conveniences. The rooms are well amenitized with everything you could want, large windows (though original historic, uninsulated) let in lots of light and upper floors offer great views of the city and surrounding neighborhood. There is a nice lobby bar and Starbucks consession that's open in the morning. There's a restaurant off the lobby which offers generally reasonable and unique choices. The staff/service is superb. Truly. I have stayed here at least two dozen times in the past 1 1/2 years, and have always enjoyed chatting with the staff, and on the rare occasion that there's an issue of some kind, it is always dealt with quickly, professionally and politely. The one and only complaint I have about the Pere Marquette is its room service menu selection. Don't get the wrong, the food is always good and the service great. However, as I'm often traveling for work for multiple nights (as I am on this trip - 7 nights), I get back from the day's meetings and need to work - and find it convenient to order room service. There are 3 \"sandwich\" choices, inclouding a burger, Texas toast grilled cheese (which is great) and a chicken salad croissant. There are two \"rotisserie\" chioces: duck and chicken. There are two \"grill\" choices: redfish and beel filet. And that, my friends, is the end of it. There are a few dessert choices and some apps - but 4 entree choices and 3 sandwiches. Really? Again, the very limited choices are always consistent and tasty (if a bit pricey). But, I've been staying here for years, and seriously, the room service menu does not change. I have asked the order-taker several times if there are \"specials\", and I am told that I may only order what's on the in-room menu. Really? Again, this is a great hotel - and ofen a \"sleeper\" when it comes to rates. There's a Marriott, a J.W. Marriott, a Ritz Carlton and a plethora of other upscale hotels in the immediate vicinity, and having stayed at all of the others, I prefer the Pere Marquette hands down. If you do some digging around on Marriott's website when booking, you can usually find a rate that's pretty close (if not cheaper) than the Courtyard that's around the corner too. I would recommend this place to anyone - and plan to submit a polite suggestion to management that they at least slightly enhance the room service menu. I doubt they'd like to know that they could lose a business traveler (me or others) over something so silly as updating a dinner room service menu selection.

My first impression was that of a long check in line with only one front desk clerk. Since 2PM is a prime check in time one would think that a single desk clerk would be insufficient. I had booked 2 rooms in either a two queen or king bed configuration. The room selection was not available due to the hotel being in an oversold position. The other nearby Marriott properties were also in oversold positions, so there was no chance at the reservations being fulfilled as booked. We were provided a queen room. Upon entering the room I found the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. A cruise ship inside cabin was larger than this room. To top it off it faced a brick wall and did not have a functional internet connection. I returned to the front desk and they had promised to switch to a king room on the second night of my stay. The next morning both of our rooms were switched to king rooms on a high floor with access to the club lounge. The new room was a standard king room as you would find in most hotels of this class. My problems did not end with the new room. The sheets were not large enough to actually fit the king bed and the pillowcases were stained. Housekeeping is clearly not doing their job. This was reconfirmed when I located a condom wrapper in clear view in the corner of the bed. Had housekeeping actually replaced the sheets from the prior guest they would have seen this. In addition to the poor housekeeping the hotel has several issues with their infrastructure. The walls are very thin often times hearing the TV in the next room. When the door closes to any room in the vicinity it can be felt several doors away. The hot water is hit or miss. One shower I could not get any hot water and the next morning the water temperature was too hot. If you do decide to brave this monstrosity then I highly advise to avoid any room ending in \u00e2\u20ac\u015314\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as these are insufficient to be called hotel rooms.

I was told by the bartender he wasn't the best for a Bloody Mary, so he got someone else to make the drink for us.

The water during my shower went from a nice flow to no flow, then came back on bursting freezing cold water. This happened twice during the shower. My husband had no problem with the shower, but could not get hot water out of the sink faucet, so he shaved with cold water. We reported the problem on our way out. The shower was fixed when we returned, but not the sink faucet. We met another couple for breakfast, and three chose the buffet while one chose just coffee. We had to chase down someone to get the coffee after quite a long wait, then we were charged for four breakfast buffets. $18 is quite an expensive cup of coffee. It took so long to get the check fixed, we decided to leave and let the hostess know we would pay when we returned. She had just finished revising the breakfast check as we were ready to leave. It took approximately 25 minutes to get the check fixed. As we were leaving, we noticed our rental car in the garage, and I asked my husband to get our umbrella. The car was unlocked, unattended, and we could easily have had things stolen. In fact, keys were in the car so the whole car could have been stolen! When we returned to the hotel, our room had been serviced, but no fresh washcloths or coffee was left in the room. We left for dinner, told the front desk about cloths and coffee. Yes, it was replenished while we were gone. However, when I went into the bathroom looking for washcloths, I couldn't find any. My husband found them by the coffeepot. Strange? Maybe, unknown to me, most people actually bathe by the coffeepot instead of in the bathroom. We had a cocktail in the lobby bar before dinner, and wine choices were extremely minimal. In fact, the only red wine choice was nasty tasting at $9 a glass. I was told by the bartender something to the effect that they are short on funds for wine. Also, upon our return from dinner, I had to use the toilet, as soon as I sat down, it began making a bizarre, almost shrill noise, and I jumped up so fast I almost peed all over myself. We went outside for a cigarette, and two housekeepers were on the elevators with us complaining about their jobs, quitting, and being run ragged that evening by the guests. My thought was if they had left washcloths and properly serviced rooms the first time, they wouldn't have been being run ragged. VERY unprofessional of them to complain about their jobs in the presence of guests. Just as we got to sleep there was a very loud static in the room. It lasted about ten seconds when a voice finally interrupted saying the fire alarm is a false alarm. I had been in the hotel business for 20 years, and I have never heard loud static as an alarm.

I had a rate of under $75/night making it well worth it. Location - This is really an ideal location for a couple of reasons. It's a safe location, and you're only a couple minute walk from Bourbon St., just off Canal. And you're also only a couple minute walk to the St. Charles streetcar stop. And being just outside the French Quarter makes for a quiet hotel but a couple minutes away from a lot of noise (if you want that). Getting a cab is also very easy here. The hotel lobby itself is quite striking - a bit modern, sharp, nice bar scene, and there's also a Starbucks and a couple of computers for internet use. The rest of the hotel is pretty nice looking too - I liked the little jazz touches (pictures) throughout the hotel, and the potpourri next to the elevators on each floor. Most of the decor (flooring, furniture, furnishings) appears to be on the newer side and this helps make the hotel physically attractive. The ice water with oranges/grapefruit in the lobby most hours of the day was a nice touch, especially when coming in from the heat. All of the staff I encountered were very friendly. That being said, there were a couple of service glitches. First, there is usually only one person at the front desk at a time (although I did notice two on a couple of occasions). Thus, if you need something at the front desk, you could end up waiting 10 minutes or more. This happened to me when the key to my room stopped working and I needed to have them rescan the key. Also, they didn't make up my room one day. I called when I got back to the room late in the afternoon and I said \"no problem\" about the room not being made up but I asked for fresh towels. When I had still not received the towels a few hours later, I had to call again. Oh well. But when they did make up the room, they did it well. I suspect that the service issues are probably the result of hotel being understaffed. But one thing that was very efficient were the elevators. You will never wait long for an elevator. My room - overall good enough size and again, the furniture and carpeting were in very good shape. I wondered about my bed mattress though as it sloped badly near the edges. Also, one of the windows had a pretty big crack. There is high speed internet in the rooms (12.95 I believe, although it's free for Marriott Silver and above) and a decent sized desk should you need to work. The internet connection was pretty fast, although not wireless. There was also a good size safe in the room. The room itself seemed pretty quiet and the hotel was sold out a couple of nights. Either I had very quiet neighbors throughout my floor or the walls are pretty thick. I was on a club floor (17) but the club lounge on the 19th floor was closed every time it should have been open. So if you are Marriott Silver or above, don't stay here expecting to have continental breakfast or drinks in the club lounge. The bathroom was slightly small, but had decent counter space. I liked the Lather brand soaps/shampoos. My room featured a stand alone shower only and it was a little tight. Water pressure was definitely an issue . . . pretty light . . . but worse was water temperature. Often, the sink did not have hot water, and it varied throughout the day without reason. The shower temperature frequently changed too, but I was never without hot water in the shower (although at the same time I wouldn't have even warm water in the sink). The pool area is pretty poor. It's on the 3rd floor outdoor deck and features a handful of chaise loungers with torn fabric, a very tiny pool about the size of a very large hot tub, and mostly shade throughout the day. If a pool is important to your stay, don't stay here. The fitness room had a few treadmills and a couple of ellipticals - at least one of each type featured non-working controls and the machines are pretty dated. There's also an exercise bike and some dumbbells.

The hotel is located in the Central Business District, only one and a half blocks from the French Quarter. The spot provides a quiet environment away from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon Street, but also gives the convenience of many restaurants, shops, bars, etc. all within walking distance. The St. Charles streetcar is also only a two block walk and will take you straight through the center of the city, making frequent stops from one end to the other. While this Renaissance has a snooty French name, it has been renovated with trendy decor. The guests skew younger, providing the hip lounge with an active bar scene. The stylish lobby also contains free internet access, several seating areas, a Starbucks (unfortunately only open in the morning), and complimentary fruit-enhanced water. The front desk service is very helpful, though somewhat inept. My friend and I had a reserved a portion of our stay through Hotels.com, and the remainder through the hotel directly, as it provided additional availability. Upon check-in, the front desk attendant had confirmed that he would blend the bookings so that we would not have to change rooms or be otherwise inconvenienced. However, our digital room keys stopped working on the day our first reservation expired. We had to revisit the lobby to amend the situation, which was aggravating. We also had an issue with the concierge. I had called down one evening to inquire about local food delivery options. The concierge kindly offered to drop off some menus. We were initially very impressed by this, especially since it would be providing competition for their in-room dining. Well, of the four menus we received, two did not even deliver to our area; one was too hectic because of Jazzfest and not available to come to our hotel; and the last was Domino's, which we refused to order in NO. In the end, we wound up with the hotel room service, but we loved the food! Our mixed greens salads were topped with edible, fresh flowers; sunflower seeds; and a light lemon vinaigrette. Our cheese platter included a bold bleu, stiff Parmesan, and creamy brie. These delectable dairy selections were served with homemade raisin bread toast, fig and berry compote, and apple jam. We were able to make tasty little sandwiches from the fantastic selection. We also received glasses of ice water, slices of cornbread, and amazing cheese biscuits with our tray. Needless to say, we were very satisfied with the meal and quick service. We also took advantage of the fitness center, which offered three treadmills, two Precor machines, and some free weights. Each machine was equipped with its own television. Additional amenities included fresh fruit, cold hand towels, full bathroom with shower facilities, complimentary headphones, a water cooler, and a vending machine for Gatorade. The attached pool was on the roof of the third floor, providing a calm oasis, but little sun as the area was fenced in by larger neighboring buildings. We were satisfied with our clean room as well. The bed space was a bit more cramped than most and was missing an additional seating area. However, we were provided with a large television, desk, and vast selection of coffees and teas. The bathroom was spacious and modern. The shower was refreshing, but could have benefited from stronger water pressure. On a whole, we were content with the accommodations.

It's a historic building, but the design has that sleek, hip feel that Renaissance seems to be striving for. We liked being in these surroundings, and we liked the people who work here. ROOMS: They were a bit small, but perfectly nice and featuring local art. The beds are great, and so is the shower. You'll get all the usual in-room amenities. The only odd thing to report was the in-room coffee. You can make two cups, one regular and one decaf. We would have each liked a cup of coffee with caffeine -- didn't really understand why they couldn't leave enough for both of us to get what we wanted. SERVICE: Everyone on the staff was universally friendly, from the check-in to Starbucks to the valet. The service itself was hit or miss. On the negative side, we asked for a bottle opener that never arrived. On the positive side, we spoke to a bartender who took the time to determine our tastes and then recommend new drinks that we might otherwise never have thought of. On the negative, our bags never quite made it downstairs upon checkout (our request apparently never made it to the bellhop; should have found him myself). On the positive, we were given $15 in free Starbucks coupons (treated like cash) just for being Marriott Rewards Silver Elite. And the staff at MiLA Restaurant was also fantastic. OOOOOH THAT SMELL: Other reviewers have commented on the scent of the lobby. I didn't notice the smell more than once, and only when my girlfriend commented on it. But she noticed it whenever we were near the hotel's main entrance -- nice scent, but overpowering to her. Not a big deal, unless you're sensitive to it and spending a lot of time at the registration desk. RESTAURANT (MiLA) -- I'm going to write a separate review on this fine restaurant. I am always split between wanting to see more of the city and spending at least some time in the hotel that I've paid to be at. In this case, I read the reviews about MiLA and decided this would be a great place to eat a nice dinner. We were not disappointed. Our table tried several things on the menu, including dessert. Each of us had our favorites, but we all agreed that MiLA was one of our better meals in awhile. VALUE: We actually used points to pay for the room, but the actual cost would've been $119 a night. I've seen it available for $99/night, as well. For a hotel of this caliber, that's a bargain. NOISE: I didn't hear any noise from the other rooms, nor did we hear any noise from the street. But drunk hotel guests coming back to their rooms at 3, 4 and 5 in the morning were no treat. Is it that hard to keep your voices down in the hall? I think sober people know that, because returning guests got louder as the night wore on. We can only hope that maid service returned the favor and woke up these loud guests early! :-) INTERNET: You can print your boarding passes in the lobby if you're flying out. That's convenient. In-room access is free if you're a Marriott Rewards member with Elite status. I think it's $12.95 otherwise.

There is also a computer right near the concierge where you can print out boarding passes free of charge. Little things like that, as well as complimentary water with lemon, are nice touches. Check in was fast, and as requested, they had our room ready 5 hours before check-in time. Our room did not disappoint overall, but there was definitely an odor of smoke and there was a plastic bag (looked like a garbage can liner) over the smoke detector. We notified the front desk and they said they'd put an air filter in the room. I'm not sure whether they did, as the room continued to smell, as did the hallway, even though it was a non-smoking floor. The pool was nice, but small, and may not have had enough seating on a busier weekend. The gym was also nice. The staff was friendly and accommodating the entire weekend.

As a former local, I wasn't put off by the location of the entrance or the fact that we'd be 1 block from the parade route. The first weekend is pretty tame in comparison with the second weekend. My son loved being able to walk from the hotel to the parades. And that was especially convenient for the evening parades. I have to agree with other travelers about the scent. As soon as I exited my taxi from the airport, I could smell the fragrance that's being pumped into the lobby and into the street. As first blush it was attractive, but then it became cloying and annoying. Check in was easy, but I was unimpressed by the lobby. It is nice that they have a computer dedicated to flight check in and a printer solely for the purpose of printing boarding passes. And I loved that they had free internet access on desktops right near the in-hotel Starbucks. Unfortunately for me it was also very close to the bar....LOL! The room was tight and the space was not used in the most efficient manner. But it was clean. And the bed was comfy enough, although the last 2 days of our 4 day trip my back was hurting. The pros - the most and best lighting options of any hotel I've ever stayed in. An amazingly huge bathroom. The air vents were anywhere near a place where they blow directly on the bed - for me a plus, for my husband a minus. The negs - not so thrilled with yet another hotel that does not have shelves for towels (ick!). They had two hooks near the shower and a hook on the back of the bathroom door. There was no tub, which isn't a problem for me and my husband, but my pre-school son was not at all happy about having to use the shower - admittedly it was Euro style and on a hose, but he still cried the entire time we bathed him. Also, I don't know whether it was the location of our room's windows or if it was the vents in the room, but we got the strongest scent of meat on the grill during dinner hours. It was particularly strong on the Friday night. When we walked out of the hotel I looked up at our windows and saw that they were in line (albeit 15 floors higher) with the vents from the restaurant. It was annoying, but the smell was gone by about 10pm - around when the kitchen shut down. I'm a Marriott member and so, we were put on a high executive floor meaning we had access to the executive lounge. This came in handy in the AM for free quick coffee and a bite to eat, but they are closed on the weekends in the morning. In the evening they had hors d'eourves and free soda and water. And best of all Zapps potato chips. Which they ran out of by day 2 and never replenished during our trip. Otherwise, I found the staff to be pretty helpful and accomodating. They also allowed us an extra hour for check out. I had to cajole them, but they eventually gave in the morning of check out. I also got two bills and they assured me that I'd only be charged once, that one had an error on it so they printed a second one that was left under my door. Come to think of it, I need to go check my statement to make sure I was only charged once.... All in all, I think you get what you pay for with this hotel.

Decor and staff were great. I like the crisp, clean lines and modernly elegant boutique atmosphere. The lobby lounge was beautiful. The room was clean, spacious, nice and relaxing.

This street actually turns into Bourbon St. once you cross Canal st.) I never even needed a car or taxi. I walked easily to the French Quarters, Harrah's Casino, and French Market. If you don't want to walk to the French Market, the street car trollies are just a block or 2 away. I'm a single girl traveler and had no problems walking back to the hotel at night.

One expects more when requesting a concierge room--which wasn't initially given, and had to be asked for, even though the room rate indicated the upgraded room. This room was very noisy--the hotel room doors slammed constantly and the traffic continued all night with the horns beeping, loud stereos, etc. Yes, this is New Orleans, but some people like to sleep a few hours a night. Coffee machine could not be readily accessed to pour water into it unless you had the small hands of a 5 year old. A very poor design.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised. I booked the hotel through the organisers of the conference I was attending at a rate of $95 per night. I had requested a double w/ two double beds since I was expecting a friend to join me. In the end she couldn't make it so I asked if the room could be changed to a king on arrival. The front desk was very obliging and made the change instantly despite being very full. They also had a package I had sent prior to arrive to the hotel brought to my room right away. The room (717) was a good size and clean. I think it was designed for disabled access. It had a closet, desk, good size bathroom with shower/bath. The room was surpisingly quiet even though it was next to the vending area for ice and vending machines. I ordered room service the first night I was there. The hotel is still not running the full room service menu but did provide a shortened version for use. I ordered from this and 5 minutes later someone from the hotel knocked on the door and told me that the menu had changed slightly and asked me to choose something else. Whilst not ideal, the food followed soon after and was really very good. Breakfast was not included in my rate, but there is a Starbuck's in the lobby that does coffee and fruit/yogurt which is ideal for breakfast on the run. My room was made up by the time I returned everyday around lunchtime. The hotel was excellently placed for eating and drinking, just one block from Bourbon Street and the French Quarter. The hotel does have a restaurant as well and a small bar in the lobby. It also has a pool (outdoor) and a gym, but I didn't use either of these. Overall, I thought the staff were friendly and helped as much as they could. Speaking to other people at the conference, I think this hotel probably fared better than some of the others in New Orleans. I think it is a good choice for business or pleasure given its location and the facilities offered. My only gripe was the information provided by the hotel. They displayed the folder showing the standard information about all Renaissance hotels and their services, even when it is clear that they are not yet offering all that they used to pre-Katrina.

The hotel restaurant has been moved to the lobby on the first floor. They are renovating the original. The menu is somewhat limited but the food was wonderful and well presented. Streets around this hotel are under construction and that made it somewhat diffucult to drive. There is still much to do in all of New Orleans to get things back to pre-katrina levels. What ever this hotel lacked, it made up for with excellent staff and small touches that made you feel welcome. They bend over backwards to see if they can accomodate you.

They let us know our reservations were confirmed but that the hotel's restaurant, lobby, and bar would be closed for renovations; the rep was effusive in his thanks for our not canceling our trip. We felt very good about being loyal to New Orleans--and Marriott. HOWEVER, when we arrived at the Renaissance Pere Marquette, we were told our reservation was no longer valid at the pre-Katrina rate. \"It will be substantially higher,\" said the female desk attendant, who was very gruff and curt with us. She claimed our reservation was a \"corporate\" one--not one through them directly (???). When we asked to see the manager, someone (not the manager) came down and was sarcastic in stating that he could not honor our previous reservations--we would have to pay much more to stay there. They also told us no other rooms were available in the city. (!) We're not sure what's going on but we're contacting the city's hotline on price-gouging to find out how they can investigate them not honoring corporate reservations.

We paid $85/night via priceline.com. This is a great hotel. Everyone was extremely friendly, helpful during check-in, etc. Anytime you passed a maid, bellboy, etc anywhere in the hotel, it was always, \"HI, how are you? How's your stay so far? etc\" The staff was excellent. Overall, the hotel is very nice, done up in a modern style. The lobby is super air-conditioned, you'll appreciate this in muggy NOLA. The lobby is big, plush chairs. The overall hotel was kept CLEAN, including the lobby, the hallways, the rooms, etc. The rooms themselves are smallish, with one table and a Herman Miller chair, one king-sized bed (in our case), and a small bench at the edge of the bed. The bathrooms are spacious, but only have a shower, and no bath-tub, jacuzzi, etc. There is a safe in the room that is large enough to accomodate a laptop --- which is very nice, and got its use while we were there. There's a closet with plenty of hangers, and free robes for your use(we didn't use them) Overall the rooms are modern, up to date, very clean, etc. The maid always had the room cleaned from the time we left, 'til the time got back. We often slept in, and so we might leave at 11am, and be back within a couple hours. A lot of hotels don't pay attention to your schedule, or bang on the door at 9am or 10am. The cleaning staff was very attentive. The room size is quite acceptable at the price we paid. I would have been upset had I paid more than $200/night and got this room. I still think this hotel would be a bargain at twice the price, however. The in-room adjustable air-conditioner worked great, which is sometimes shaky in hotels in warm areas. There is in-room high speed internet access ($10 extra per night), but we didn't need it. My laptop picked up a free dhcp-providing wireless internet access from somewhere --- not sure if it was the hotel's or a neighboring business in the tall office building next door. The pool, btw, is small and only 3.6ft deep. There are perhaps only 8 chairs around the pool, but we had no problem getting in and out of the pool. The free health club/gym that was there had enough equipment including treadmills, weights, etc. The location is just outside of the French Quarter, one block west of Canal St, and one block North of Bourbon street. Definitely far enough from the noise/commotion, and not a bad walk to the French Quarter. Crossing Canal can sort of be a pain in the butt, but there are 'walk' lights for pedestrians. The St. Charles streetcar stops right at the edge of the hotel's street (Common Street), and provides easy access to various parts of New Orleans including Garden District, Riverfront, etc etc. The location is good. I saw some negative reviews of the hotel listed here, and I wonder if they even stayed at the same hotel as we did. We won this hotel via Priceline, and wondered what we had got ourselves into.
