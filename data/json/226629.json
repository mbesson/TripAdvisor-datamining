We were only staying 1 night and though to give it a try. Check in was great, but neither couple got the rooms we booked. My husband and I got a room with 2 beds and we requested 1 bed, and my parents had also requested a room with 1 bed which they did, but it was in the \"presidential suite\". Neither of us complained because it wasn't that big of deal. FYI - the presidential suite means it has a separate bedroom from the main living room and bathroom, there was nothing special about it. Anyway, both rooms were very nice, appeared clean, had microwaves and refrigerators, comfortable beds, and double sinks in the bathroom, all of which was really nice and we were pleasantly surprised considering the price we were paying. The outside of the buildings are pretty, however building 1 has outside entry rooms and building 2 has interior entry rooms so I'm not sure what's going on there. Breakfast was continental and it ends very early and there wasn't much left an hour before it. Loses when we went down so get there early. I would rate this hotel 3 out of 5 because it's a terrific deal and is very nice. You don't even get a fridge at the Radisson if you need a comparison.

Carpets were stained and ripped. Ceiling was falling apart in the bathroom. Smelled of cigarette smoke that they tried to cover up with Lysol. But that wasn't even the worst part. Our room was in another building from the main office. We had to drive around the back down a hill. So, saying that they are just across the street from the Grand Palace is not exactly a fact. We were told we wouldn't need a rental car, that we could get around in Branson very easily. Not a fact. Attractions are miles apart and the hotel is not a mere 25 minutes from the airport. It is 45 minutes to an hour and would have cost over $100 one way by taxi. I specifically called the hotel and asked how far it was from Springfield to their hotel. Again, they had their facts wrong. The night we got there, we tried calling the front desk around 11pm for a wake up call and no one answered after over 20 rings! We left early the next morning and were gone all day. We came back at 5pm to find no one had made the bed or replaced the towels or emptied the trash. We had been totally forgotten. I called the front desk. They sent someone down with towels. I had to ask them for another bar of soap...since the ONE they gave us the day before was used up. No replacement for coffee or shampoo were brought back the second time either. That night we called the front desk at 6pm to ask for a 5:30 am wake up call. They told us no problem...but we set the alarm clock in the room also just in case. At the last minute, I set my alarm on my cell phone...................You guessed it. No wake up call. The clock radio never went off. The only alarm to work was the alarm on my cell phone. We made our flight. This hotel was the most poorly run hotel I have ever seen. I would definitely stay somewhere else next time and be sure to rent a car with my flight ticket.

The pillow top mattress was comfortable and each bed had 4 pillows. Our room had a coffee pot, microwave, and refrigerator. For breakfast we had to walk down a hill to building 2. This part of the hotel had indoor corridors and best for handicapped accessible. Both building 1 and building 2 had elevators. The breakfast room was very nice and clean. The counter that was set up for breakfast was very small. They only offer waffles, bagels, English muffins, donuts, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juices, tea and coffee. The lady that set up the breakfast was very very friendly and kept the area very clean. If I stayed here again I would request building 2 which is a flatter area for walking.

The walls are also still old and so are paper thin...we heard much more than we would have liked to over the course of late nights and the early mornings. We were not given a price and were shocked to find out that it is not comparable (as we had thought) to the other Branson small scale inns on the strip. 72.95 a night...81 with their two taxes, for ONE bed in a tiny room. The \"fitness\" center consists of one fold up treadmill and one stationary bike. Our bed did not get made by roomservice on the Saturday we were there. The bed looked very nice but when you sleep on it you feel a different situation the next morning...neck pains, back pains...you name it.
