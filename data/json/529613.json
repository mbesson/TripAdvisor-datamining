Staff are very helpful, pleasant and have superb language skills, the Hotel itself is very comfortable and spotlessly clean. The little bar is well stocked and reasonably priced. My wife and I stayed in room 204 and although it is at the front of the hotel looking out over the street below, we heard very little noise and had no interuption to our sleep. The location is without dounbt one of Hotel Cecils strong points, 5 mins walk to the Spanish steps, 10 mins to Trevi fountain, 20 mins to the Coleseum and all sights worth seeing in Rome are within easy walking distance, including the Vatican which is around 40 mins walk at a slow pace. I booked Taxi service with Adele via email, and the drivers were both top notch and very reasonably priced. To sum up, I would highly reccommend this hotel to anyone wishing to go to Rome for a short break, its an excellent comepetitivly priced hotel well worth the money. ps, less than a minutes walk from the hotel (turn right on exit) is the T-Bone Steak station, an almost untouchable resteraunt serving some of the best food I had on our stay in Rome!", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for the money in Rome\u201d", "Author": "magdalena94", "ReviewID": "UR121869378", "Content": "After staying 5 days in a very expensive 5 star Hotel in Rome I had to find another hotel for one night before my departure. Walking around I came to Hotel Cecil. I liked my stay there better then in the 5 star hotel. It was cosy and secure. The staff was so friendly and made me feel good to be their guest. The location is the best, 1 minute from Spanish stairs, a few minutes from Fontana di Trevi and Villa Borghese. A lot of nice restaurants and little snack bars around the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable, small though but that was the case also in the expensive hotel. I liked the breakfast aerea and enjoyed a good breakfast compared to many other places in Italy. Food in Italy is fantastic, they just do not care about breakfast so much. But it was really fine and I did not come to Rome for the breakfast. A taxi to the airport was organized by the nice staff and it arrived on time. I wish I could have stayed longer and will for sure come back to this hotel.

In general, it was an OK hotel in an excellent neighborhood.

Rooms have decent size, bathroom was clean, location is really good. Blanket on the bad was terrible: it was clean and good looking but it was made of of some cheap synthetic material that we were not able to sleep at all. Breakfast was below the average comparing to Germany for example, but not bad. If you want to have early breakfast (stated it is served from 7.00 am) it might be a disappointing experience if there are not many guests in the hotel (as in our case): they may be 30 min late without showing any shame or guilt for it. But, in summary all was reasonably good till the last day. You are expected to check out at 11.00. We woke up early and had a coffee outside. We returned to hotel at 9.00 to have a rest for an hour or two before our flight. To our unpleasant surprise they did everything to kick us out earlier: cleaning lady knocked our door every 20 min even though we told her we were sleeping. Then some aggressive lady from the reception desk kept calling room next to ours (cleaning lady of course left the door open) hoping we will be annoyed enough to finally leave. Then, since it did not deliver result they hoped for, receptionist called us and with obviously faked \"kindness\" asked when do we plan to check out (it was 10.00 o'clock after more than 40 min being of making special noise in the corridor, knocking at our door and calling rooms next to ours). Have to say I never experienced something like this in my life! When we finally left the room (it was of course before 11.00) receptionist (aggressive, falsely kind lady, probably the owner or oldest employee) had nuts to ask if all was OK during our stay. Actually, it was before she decided to perform her \"kick the guests out\" show.

In fact, about the only good things I could say about it are that the location is fantastic (just a couple of minutes by foot from the Spanish Steps) and the staff is friendly. Other than that, the rest of my experience was pretty abominable. First of all, I was shown to a room on the second floor (202, I think), which was really small, very rundown and extremely smelly. I can't remember the last time I asked to change rooms in a hotel... but in this case, I would have actually changed hotels if they hadn't had anything else to propose because the room really gave me the creeps. The guy on the front desk was really helpful and gave me the key to another room. The only problem was that when I finally managed to open the door, there was somebody else's suitcase already in there. He'd forgotten it had already been attributed. In the end, it was not so much a case of third time lucky, but third time \"vaguely acceptable\"... as I settled into a room on the fourth floor. Throughout all of this, I had expended numerous calories walking up and down the (rather dirty) stairs because the lift took forever to come. The couple of times I did manage to catch it, it jumped down about 50 centimetres every time I stepped into it\u2014a little scary. What was even more frightening was all the hair that somebody else had left behind in my bathroom. There were hairs on the walls, the floor, the bidet and in the bathtub. Yuck! Before I headed out for dinner, I mentioned this to the guy on the reception and asked that they be cleaned away. The way he reacted made me think it wasn't going to be done... and I was correct. When I got back, all the hair was still there and the next day I had to fish it out of the tub before I could take a shower. Otherwise, the acoustics in the hotel were lousy. I could hear someone in the room on the other side of the corridor blowing their nose. The decor looked like it hadn't been touched since the 1950s and the whole place didn't look very clean. In reality, it definitely doesn't look anywhere near as good as the deceptive images on the hotel's website. There was no hot water in the sink in the bathroom and only a limited amount in the shower. There was no Internet connection in the room... and no space in the breakfast room. So, I didn't get to taste the continental breakfasts which other people raved about.

Great views from the rooftop garden. On arrival at the hotel we were warmly greeted, shown to our rooms which were on the same floor and next to each. As we were a family group, the hotel arranged, without our asking, to have the rooms located next to each other for convenience and enjoyment. The hotel Manager and all staff were very friendly and always greeted us with a smile and asked after our welfare. The Manager asked us daily if we had any problems and if we wre satisfied with the standard of our accomodation, service and cleaning. On arrival we were given a map of Rome, shown where things were and given advice about making visits. Throughout our stay the manager and staff helped with locating places to see and where necessary ,transport arrangements.The hotel areas and en-suite bedrooms were always clean and comfortable and air conditioned.

Trevi fountain ( max. 10 min. ) and Spanisch steps (really on 3 minutes walking) were really close to the Hotel. Further walking to the Colosseum, Vatican city, Foro Romana, the Pantheon, and other nice places was possible within 30 minutes to one our walking. Nearby we found some really nice restaurants, but around the trevi Fountain we found our place. Not to expensive but really nice and cosy was the 'Al Picchio' restaurant. Good food, nice atmosphere, and the staff is really Ok!! Further about the Hotel. After a day walking through Rome, the hotel lounge was a perfect place to evaluate the day. The Hotel staff was really friendly and always asking if you enjoyed the day. The rooms were Ok, and for a hotel build in the 16th century the rooms were clean, big, and the beds were ok. After a good night sleep the breakfast was good, More choice in food than an average person has at home. Croissant, toast, eggs, good espresso, and a normal choice of bread siege. Every morning before when walked out of the hotel, the nice reception lady asked if she could do something for us, or if we need some help to have a wonderfull day in Rome.

But as this was the last night traveling back from our vacation in Croatia, we targeted a $200 budget or so as we wanted to be closer in to the historical area and not deal with a super crummy room. Some things Americans need to be aware of about mid-range hotels (from my perspective, that's $US 150-$250 per night in the historical area) in Rome to give you context: - don't expect modern, remodeled rooms. Hotels commonly seem to have older furniture (1960's, 1970's). Cleanliness should be good. - you may want to make sure there is an elevator if you are a budget traveler with big baggage. - hot water with good pressure, and showers that have an overhead faucet are to be appreciated. Older hotel bathrooms frequently have just a small tub with a hose & shower head that goes a few feet high, so you have to sit in the tub to shower properly. The first thing that struck us upon arrival was the warm greeting and great service from the reception. Though I spoke Italian, the gentleman was eager to give an introduction to the neighborhood and offered in several languages. He pulled out a map, circled the hotel and then pointed out the sites near the hotel. We appreciated the warmth and pro-activity. The room was pretty much as described above. Room was very clean. Strong air conditioning with good controls. Furniture was dated. Bathroom had good overhead shower with warm water, strong pressure.

We said no, and to please show us another one. The only other one that was left was one for 200 euros, and since we were desperate, we took it. We had two suitcases and weren't about to waste a whole day in Rome looking for a place to sleep for the night. The room was the worst rip-off in the world. The bed was a large bed big enough for two, but the metal springs that the mattress was sitting on was sticking out and almost cut my leg as I walked by. That being said, when you slept in the bed, you'd inevitably roll into the middle because the springs in the mattress were so poor and the support from underneath was terrible. Then the bathroom had no mat to step on and no garbage pail was in the room, There were only two towels that they gave us, and one we had to share and the other we used to step on when we got out of the shower. But it gets better. There was no shower curtain or glass enclosure, so all the water from the shower ended up on the floor, we were slipping all over the place. There was a desk and a small TV stand that when opened, a bucket of dust like on the Munsters flew out.

One reviewer states the hotel is in need of makeover which ironically one hotel booking website (not Tripadvisor) states Hotel Cecil was renovated only 2-3 years ago. My friends and I booked 2 rooms over 5 nights. Their bathroom was clean and newish however, the water from the showerhead flowed in a stream as if it was coming out of a tap. Also, the shower was over the bathtub (or combination of both) - this is not an issue as long as there is a showerscreen!! Consequently, the lack thereof resulted in a very wet floor. My bathroom was a HORROR. They seem to have missed the bathroom when renovating: old orange and brown 70s tiles (yes, original). Not dirty but how can you tell how clean it is when it's so old? Tiny, tiny shower (or should I say recess) with a nylon shower curtain. I wish I had taken a photo of the bathroom so you could see just how AVERAGE it was. To the hotel's credit, conversely to the other reviewer, we found both our rooms had individually controlled airconditioning which worked rather well. Another good point was the double set of windows completely blocking out the noise from the street below. We found the desk staff friendly enough, however when it was time to settle the account at checkout, the matriarch of this family-run hotel declined our traveller's cheques (in Euros mind you), which was rather inconvenient as we had to go to the nearest Thomas Cook outlet to get them cashed. The other problem we had was with the breakfast. All food was packaged except for a basket of bread rolls. Packaged croissants etc etc. But the worst part about breakfast were the dirty glasses which still had lipstick stains on them. At first I thought a customer had returned the dirty glass by mistake but alas, a few on the tray were the same. This tray of glasses had been placed on the buffet only minutes before by the waiter with water droplets still on some glasses, indicating they had just been washed. Apparently not well enough! Unclean. I would certainly NOT recommend this to any of my friends and would definitely not return myself.", "Date": "July 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cFawlty Towers-esque\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3588604", "Content": "A group of us stayed in the Hotel Cecil in March. While the price was reasonable and the location unbeatable, the hotel itself was a major letdown. Rooms are in major need of an update and breakfasts inedible. 'Highlight' of the holiday was a faulty fire alarm which beeped every 3 minutes from 6.00am. The night porter was utterly unhelpful and refused to replace the battery despite complaints from everyone on our floor.
