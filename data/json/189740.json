The room rate was very cheap and the journey on the train into Central London is only 25minutes long, so not actually as far as other reviews suggest.

We weren't expecting luxury for our \u00c2\u00a344 double room but expected cleanliness and basic facilities. On arrival we were told they did not have a booking for us; they asked us to log on to our emails on one of their computers and prove our booking through bookings.com. They then advised that there were no double rooms available and could only offer us a twin room. We were tired after a long day house hunting so agreed. It took around 15 minutes to locate our room through the hotel's maze of corridors with insufficient signs and an awful musty smell. We eventually found it at the very back of the hotel and were greeted with lots of noise from the surrounding rooms as the walls were paper thin. The room was like a prison cell. There was no window, the metal bed frames were rusting, the bed linen was stiff, the chest of drawers (the only other item of furniture in the room) was falling to pieces and the TV on top had a broken aerial hanging off it. Also the loo seat was on the floor in the bathroom. We decided we couldn't stay in the room and trudged back with all our luggage to reception. After explaining that the state of our room wasn't satisfactory we were offer a room with a window. We checked this, and apart from the fact that there was natural light in the room it's general state was no better. We demanded a refund and were told that there was no manager on site to authorise it. They took our details and advised they would get the manager to action the refund when she was next in. I emailed them a week later to ask where the refund was and the manager apologised and advised she'd not received the note. She asked for my account details and advised it would be sorted the next working day. I chased again a week later as I'd still not received it and was told the same.

This hotel ticked both those boxes and we knew about the reviews so bit the bullet and booked it. On arrival we parked in the large car park which many London hotels do not have. There are steep steps that go up to the main reception area so those with buggies etc... may struggle. On arrival at reception we were met by a guy that must have been coming to the end of his shift as he really couldn't be bothered, but we checked in with no hassle and made our way to the 4th floor for our room. On arrive to the room which was a cluster of 4 rooms in a small lobby area, but strange but OK, we'll manage, we were pleasantly surprised. It was small, but clean, and the double bed, made out of two bed pushed together was huge and it didn't know it was two pushed together until closer inspection. The bathroom was clean but sadly in the morning we found the shower didn't work. We were in a rush so had to fill the bath quick and wash in the bath, not ideal but we managed. The bar is just off reception now and not down stairs as orginally thought. The bar is reasonably priced, \u00c2\u00a37.50 for one and a half pints of lager, two halves of coke and two packets of crisps. Breakfast is as previously mentioned so I won't go in to detail. But if you are not happy with the offerings, there is a decent Wetherspoons 5 minutes away as well as some good cafes. You DON'T have to eat in the hotel! Sadly though the walls are partitions and thin so you know everything going on next door...litterally if you know what I mean. So much so the kids asked in the morning what all the noise was next door so we told them it was workmen working nights! Our room was a the front of the hotel so there was some road noise, but we were so tired it didn't bother us. Local to the area is Crystal Palace National Sports Stadium, Crystal Palace FC, shops, tubes to central London. The hotel is being renovated so they are working to put things right. It's not the Ritz but like I said, we needed a budget hotel in this part of London with parking and it worked for us. We knew what to expect and got it. You pay for what you get so if you are not happy with this hotel, pay more and stay in a higher grade hotel...simple! I would stay here again but would check the shower works first!

We parked in the last available space in the front car park, between 3 foreign coaches and some white vans, which was perhaps not a good sign, especially as there is a minicab company in the hotel basement. We were greeted at check in by a charming man who was at pains to tell us that we could park round the back of the hotel in a secure car park - breathed sigh of relief! What other reviewers have said about \"the labyrinth\" is indeed true, but there is no smell and the rooms are well signposted. I really could not understand the room numbering system, and thought that a room number beginning with 8 was going to be on the 8th floor. We went up and down several staircases on the way to our room, but the view from the window suggested that we were at first floor level. The building went up in 1854, and that is presumably how they did things then! The room was small and clean with a very effective radiator, but unfortunately the bathroom was very cold as it had no heating at all, which is not good when it is -5 outside. In general, the building is suffering from a lack of basic maintenance, and a bit more carpet vacuuming would not be out of place. Breakfast (included) is provided in one of the many function rooms in the basement and consists of juice, cornflakes, preserves and freshly made toast (not do it yourself) and a choice of hot drinks. It may not be full English, but it starts the day. On leaving, we were really pleased with how difficult it was to remove our car - thieves would have no chance.

My boyfriend and I were really hoping for something a little more adult - not to mention the room looked like a prison cell.

The 4th room appeared ok at first glance and we agreed to take it. We changed out of our traveling clothes got ready to take a shower only to find mould all over the bathroom ceiling after pulling the shower curtain back. We also discovered the window wouldnt lock, and had a big crack through it (not safe at all). We then trudged back to the reception in our pyjamas and argued with the manager for another hour. Eventually he showed us a superior room - it was like night and day. The room was big and spacious and clean!!! I said 'we'll take it'. He told us there would be an extra charge per night. I told him that I would not pay the extra, and after more arguing he eventually agreed to let us have it.

The room that we got was on the 2nd floor, but due to the nature of the building, our room was not accessible by the lifts. We had to get there via a narrow flight of stairs, with an emergency door along the way. The worst thing was that I had a heavy suitcase with me, and thus I had to lug it all the way up the stairs! The room was small (not that we didn't expect that anyway, this being a budget hotel after all), although they still managed to fit in a queen-sized bed, and they even provide coffee and tea facilities. We had some problems with the bathroom though, as we had to let the water run for at least 10 minutes after turning on the heater before the water starts getting warm. Overall, I would recommend this hotel only if you have light luggage, not only because of the room locations as described above, but also the location of the hotel itself (it takes a 10 to 15 mins walk from the train station).

The person who booked us in tried to explain something about an authorised payment on my other half card but after three attempts of trying to explain whatever it was he was trying to say we just said \"Ah ok!\" still having no clue. We weren't told what floor we were on but a moody couple who were in our lift told us it was the first floor. we wandered along the first floor corridor and holding our breath walked into what can only be described as a cheap hotel room they'd have in a terrible porno. There was semen on the curtains, a huge hole in the wall, a dirty, repulsive bathroom, a burnt iron print on the carpet, no plug for the sink, a rubbishly tiled shower, and a toilet full of un-flushed toilet roll. Worst of all though where the rooms obviously once connected the door frame was filled by a piece of MDF not quite big enough for the hole so there was quite a sizeable gap at the bottom. We sat there for a little while on the only sort of clean thing in the room, the bedspread, and stared around mortified. Determined not to let it ruin our trip we set out to find somewhere to have dinner. Having seen a sign for the hotel restaurant we diced to take a ride in the lift up to the 5th floor. Upon getting there we were confused. there was a big white table in front of us and looking into the only other room available there were a few tables scattered around with a few older people sat there with a big plate of biscuits. There was nowhere to order food that we could see and there were tables that looked like buffet tables around the edges with tea and coffee dispensers and more biscuits. Bizarre to say the least. So we ran off to the nearest Wetherspoons instead. The night sleeping there was disturbed by the guest next door stumbling in drunk, the early morning staff moving stuff around outside and the housekeeping waking us up at half 8. All in all, we didn't really sleep in the stuffy, smelly loud hotel. The hotels ONLY redeeming feature? A REALLY happy fish in the reception fish tank. This place was disgusting and dirty.

Instead of a twin it was a room with two sets of bunk beds. One set seperated as twins. The built up set was so old that the frames were very rusty. There was on one electric socket in the room, which meant you had to unplug the television to make a cup of tea. The television set was very old and only had a set top aerial which provided a very poor picture, which became intolerable to watch. The room was dirty and this standard of cleanliness is disgusting when you have paid \u00c2\u00a359 this is not anything close to value for money.

The receptionist then asked me to bring my partner into the room to so that we could check it together. I replied by saying that I can check the room myself, my partner trusts my judgement. The receptionist then gets on his walky talky and calls for another member of staff who proceeds to tell me that he will not show me the room unless I 'show' him my partner. I asked him what this was all about. He then proceeded to tell me that when girls book rooms, then invite men into the rooms there is trouble and then the police have to be called. Of course I was not only offended by this (being a 31-year-old professional women) but absolutely astonished that a hotel that is meant to be provided a service felt that it was acceptable to act this way. I went back to the car and told my partner the situation and advised him that I did not want to stay at this hotel because I did not like their attitude or what they were implying but because he was so tired he said we should go and atleast look at the room. We went back into the hotel, and the member of staff took one look at my partner and said if that he does not want any trouble or the police to be called. There was absoulutely no reason for this. My partner asked him what he was implying and the member of staff told him the same story that he told me.

They should not be allowed to stay open and I agree with someone else's review that this place should be shut down.

Well, this was incredibly confusing because this place was like a maze and I found out its half way between floor 3 and 4 in a little side door.

I don't know why he did not just send someone with me to show me the way. Anyway, after about 10 minutes I found it up some very old and dated stairs. I entered the room and was pleased by its state but I could not bear the ordeal of getting to that room so I made my way back to reception and told the manager my dilemma. He told me there were no more rooms as they were very busy I told him there was nothing wrong with the room but getting to it was murder.

The hotel is outdated and needs an emergency makeover internally and a social skills course for the staff. On arriving at the hotel we were given a room which to find seemed like an episode of the cryptum factor! The room was in the basement with a shower that a homeless person would think twice about using and general decor that was depressing. We had to tune the TV in and there was a fire exit door outside our room that wasn't locked and could be opened from the inside and outside. When we challenged the reception staff they told me that i was lying and there was no way that the door could be opened from the outside, trust me a trained monkey could open that door and on that point would make a better fist of the role on reception than the sarcastic and surly middle aged Asian gentleman i spoke to who in my opinion is a disgrace and should be fired. I was not alone in complaining, in fact in the 10 minutes i waited at reception there were 4 other guest that came up and complained about a wide range of issues and some refused to stay and left. In hindsight we should of done the same. The beds were dirty and i think staying at a youth hostel would of been a better choice! There was loud music played until 2am so not much sleep was had. What i would say is that even though i have stayed in 5 star hotels before, i did not expect this to be a 5 star, in fact i had prepared myself for a 3 star hotel. In my opinion this hotel if inspected would struggle to achieve above one star. I'm not the type of person to review anything i buy but i feel so strongly about this hotel i had to write my feelings down, hopefully to persuade people like me who though 'well it's cheap, i can put up with anything for one night!' not to stay here. The guests are mainly tourists and that is the worst thing, this hotel is unfortunately an ambassador for the UK and i'm ashamed that people visiting the UK stay here, what impression is that giving to them of us in the UK. To the management of the hotel and the general manager who i was told to see the next morning and the only person who could deal with the complaints. All i can say to you is you must be very busy dealing with complaints and either you, your line manager or the owners of this establishment need to wake up and see that the 'hotel' you 'run' is a disgrace and i would be shocked if this is not closed down when inspected next.

Although my booking promised 'english breakfast' my request was dismissed with contempt, and I was handed two pieces of toast. I tried to get a hot chocolate from the machine but was told that it wasn't working. The coffee provided was so awful I couldn't drink it and had to wash my mouth out afterwards to get rid of the taste - I couldn't decide if it was the chemicals the cup had been washed in or just very cheap. I didn't like to think what might have been running round the room during the night. The next morning some half eaten pieces of toast were strewn around the billiard room, along with piles of dirty rags/curtains. I didn't expect luxury for the price, but did expect helpful staff and a certain level of cleanliness, and for the food to at least be edible. This is truly one of the worst hotels I have ever experienced.

The staff are extremely polite and always happy to help. The hotel in general, though aged, is cosy and the bar is well-stocked. The room itself, though I booked a double, actually had one double bed and one single bed, though this was not much of a problem at all. The room was absolutely clean but very rough around the edges - wallpaper was peeling behind the radiator and fixtures and fittings, though well taken care of, were showing signs of age (particularly the taps, which were hard to turn on and off!). Breakfast is served on the fifth floor with a gorgeous view over London which, in my case, was beautifully snow-covered for most of my stay. Breakfast, for those who haven't paid for the Full English, is very basic: toast, cereal, juice and tea/coffee. However, the Full English is freshly-cooked and extremely satisfying and costs an extra \u00c2\u00a35.00 should you choose to have it. I booked through Booking.com, which said that my booking included a Full English breakfast in the room rate; when the staff attempted to charge us an extra \u00c2\u00a35.00 for it, we simply showed them the print-out of our booking confirmation and that was that for the rest of our stay. The location is, on a normal day, pretty good: it's a five minute walk to Westow Hill which is lined with restaurants (I recommend Joanna's) and a twenty minute walk or two minute bus journey to Crystal Palace station with direct trains to London Victoria. Overall, the hotel is basic and not luxurious, but you could do much, much worse for the price - places like Crystal Palace Towers (nextdoor) and Astra Palace charge similar prices for rooms and service which do not meet the standards of Queens Hotel.

I used to live in Crystal Palace so I know the area very well. I read the reviews for this hotel (which were pretty bad) but it was cheap and I wanted a night out in London so I booked this hotel all the same. Although I had very low expectations given the previous reviews I was shocked by the state of this hotel. I paid \u00c2\u00a339 for a single room (which is very cheap for London) and I still feel that I have been ripped off. The Room The room was effectively in a basement, bars across the windows, no furniture in the room and generally very run down and depressing. There was a small TV in the room with 4 channels but the remote control didn't work and the tiny areal on top of the TV had a very poor reception. There were holes in the carpets and a single hand towel which was supposed to double up as a bath towel. I was given two very small sachets of shampoo which was nowhere near adequate. The bed had a single sheet for a duvet, and the walls were so thin that when someone walked down the corridor outside my room, my whole bed would literally vibrate. I'm NOT a light sleeper but this still kept me awake all night. I don't think it was just my room, other reviewers have also commented on this. The only way to describe or compare the room and the general condition of the hotel is something similar to the horror hotel programmes you see on TV. I need to point out that I have stayed in hotels and hostels all over the world and this is by far the worst I have ever stayed in. However I did say that I would provide an honest and accurate review, so the three good things about this hotel is the location, as it's near 2 train stations (Gipsy Hill and Crystal Palace) and it's on the night bus route if you want a night out in London. Secondly my room did have hot water, and finally it does have free parking which not many hotels in London offer. Breakfast Breakfast is included in the price, however this simply consists of toast (white bread only) and a couple choices of cereal. The orange juice was so watered down it barely resembled orange juice. It certainly shouldn't sway your decision to stay here, Crystal Palace does have some nice cafes which serve good breakfast. My Recommendation Like I said, I used to live in Crystal Palace so I know the area very well. My recommendation is to stay at the Jury's Inn hotel in Croydon (approx 3 miles away). On average it's about \u00c2\u00a310 more but it's definitely worth it. Don't worry I don't work for the hotel :-), but it's in an excellent location in terms of transport links into London, it's opposite a shopping centre and the rooms and breakfast are far superior. The only downside is that you do have to pay for parking, but if you arrive after 6pm you only need to pay \u00c2\u00a33. I hope you found this review useful. :-)", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cso called honeymoon suite\u201d", "Author": "annon5", "ReviewID": "UR85467924", "Content": "me and my husband went to the queens hotel for our wedding night and it was a total shambles. we payed \u00c2\u00a3150 for a room that really was standard. though much bigger. the only upside was the jacuzzi bath.

First impressions of the hotel were fine, when we arrived at the hotel the staff were friendly, we were given our room and key card straight away. We then had a long trek through the maze of corridoors and stairs (i can only describe the decor as 'the shining' like) when we eventually got to our room all seemed fine, but the problems were yet to start. Apparently our room shared a wall with a busy corridoor which shook everytime someone walked passed, the kettle in our room was broken, the mattress was stained, there was mould on the lamps, there was dubious white stains on the chair, the shower was unable to keep constant temperature, the curtains were hanging off, there was no wardrobe, the 'double' bed was two singe beds pushed together and there was no room service or wake up call service (unlike we were promised when booking the hotel). But honestly, this was nothing in comparison to what we hd in store for us. In the morning we were awoken by a dripping noise, assuming it was from a neighbouring room we ignored it and went for our 'continental' breakfast (which included stale bread you had to toast yourself, a large tub of cornflakes, in which i did witness a man cough into while serving himself some, and tea and coffee, but there were no cups so we were unable to have any) so hastily leaving the breakfast area hungry and thirsty, we went back to our room to pack our things, only to find the dripping noise we had head earlier was the sound of our ceiling leaking water onto the table and nearby plug socket. Phoning reception, i asked for someone to be sent down immediately to assess the problem. Half an hour went by and still no one had arrived, and the leak was getting much worse and a large crack was now appearing in the ceiling. I phoned reception again and was told to \"stop being silly, and someone was on their way\" very ubruptly and rudely. When someone finally turned up, we recieved no appology and were simply told to ''get out of the room\". On checking out, feeling angry about the service, hotel room, and attitude from staff, i made a complaint, only to be told there was nothing they could do about it and we were given no appology.

We got free drinks in the bar and we thought fair enough, things could happen. But after 30 - 45 minutes, they told us that we couldn't get our room for the night. We had to wait to the next morning. We where tired and the time was now after midnight. I asked the receptionist what he meant, did we have to sleep at the street or what? He told us that we could sleep in the lobby at the hotel. We refused to sleep in a lobby with 20 other people, so we asked for our money back and asked if they could help us to get another hotel. They told us we will get our money back. That's okay, but they did not help us with anything else. They gave us free internet to search for other hotels, but we had to call them ourselves with our cellphones. We did not know where to start, and did not know where the different places where or how to get around in London in the middle of the night. I asked for help, but the receptionists just ignored us.

As we had less than an hour until our family do we decided to get ready and deal with it. on the way out I asked the receptioinst for a pile of clean sheets to be left on the bed so we could use them to sleep in.

He had obviously grown comfortably numb to the nightly stream of complaints regarding the condition of the rooms, and had adopted a stock response of a cursory shrug of the shoulders and a casual handing over of a different set of keys without a single decipherable word passing through his lips. Breakfast was not good. I, like the rest of my colleagues and numerous other guests, had arrived downstairs only to be told that breakfast was in fact being served on the top floor of the hotel. It probably wasn't worth the effort to get there. It consisted of a rather poor selection of continental style offerings, with an optional extra \u00c2\u00a34.95 payable for a cooked alternative. I waited for the inattentive waiter to leave the room, and then simply helped myself without paying. My guilt was purged by the fact that I only managed one or two mouthfuls before returning to the sanctuary of the cereals. Final verdict: If you're arriving late, getting up early and budget is an issue, then you probably won't be overly disappointed. Places to eat: Avoid the hotel restaurant.

We were advised on booking that the hotel was under refurbishment and that we would be staying in the newly refurbished rooms, only one of the rooms out of the five had been refurbished. On arrival, they asked for payment upfront, on reflection the warning bells should have rung then. Our rooms were in different parts of the hotel not together as we would have liked, my partner and I was put in the basement which was uncomfortabley warm. The room was tiny, to the point that we couldn't move around it at the same time. It also had one small window in the corner therefore making it very dark. There were stains/marks on the walls and celling which were disgusting and we couldn't tune the tv in properly. The first night the toilet cistern would not fill up properly and was running like a tap all night which kept me awake. I got up early the next morning to have a shower, which was cold. When I went to the reception desk to tell them about the shower they said there was a problem with the boilers, something that I had realised myself during my cold shower. I also informed them of the noisy toilet to which they said they would have someone from maintenance look at it in 10 minutes, I did not see anyone from maintenance, they must have fixed it while we were out at the wedding. The boiler was fixed later that morning but that was too late for me as I had an appointment with they hairdresser and had to be ready early. Breakfast was included in the fee, however I would not have eaten there if it had been the last restaurant on Earth, the rooms had dirty walls so god know what the kitchen would have been like! My pregnant step-sister had the delight of not being able to open the window in her room as the kitchen staff had put chicken outside to rot right by her window which smelt terrible. She asked them to move it which they didn't, so as a results only opened the window as she left which would have been a nice smell for the cleaners, maybe they would have done something about it then. She also did not have a plug in her bath, therefore having to improvise. My 85 year old Grandmother also did not have a plug in her sink which she found very inconvenient .

It was booked for me so I was unaware of the poor reviews before I went. Despite the fact that the website photos look ok (well they would wouldn't they?) the interior smacked of a cheap tarting-up and repaint job. I aarrived at reception to find a couple complaining that their room was impossibly hot and had no opening windows and insisting to be moved, not a good sign. The (male) receptyionist seemed rather unhelpful about that. After negotiating my check-in with someone who's grasp of the English language seemed to be not great, I went along to my allocated room, no offers of help with luggage but no real problem since my room was on the ground floor. My key card wouldn't work but after trying three times someone seemingly inside the room asked who was there. I knocked and the door opened and I was greeted by a member of staf muttering something about he thought that room was not being allocated or something like that so he asked me to wait and helpfully went to reception. That seemed to get sorted and he came back and I was able to open the door and get installed. The room itself was ok but very stark it appeared to have been redecorated in the recent past but had very basic furnishings with no pictures or anything to break up the magnolia that was everywhere. Being July I didn't need any lights until late and then found at about 10 O'Clock that none of the electrics worked in the bathroom ie centre light, light over the sink, hairdryer etc etc. I managed because I couldn't be bothered to have to move or have someone come and mess with the electrics. The bed was one of the worst matresses I've ever had in a hotel and must have been a super-economy spring version bought as a job-lot. Breakfast was a farce. Although I'd paid for B&B accomodation, breakfast was just a choice of a few cereals and toast, all self service and a choice of tea or coffee, again self service in big pots. Like othere have found, the hotel couldn't keep up with the guests and it was evident that plates and cups etc kept running out and it was also impossible to find a table not already cluttered with used crockery and cutlery. I had to share with someone else because there weren't even enough tables anyway. Apart from being near Crystal Palace stadium it has nothing to recommend it.

They'd lost my booking!!!! After a brief discussion with an incredibly unhelpful manager, and me having to email them a copy of my reservation confirmation, they called me back with my reservation number, and reluctantly confirmed I could check in from 1pm. On arrival at the hotel at 1.15 we were initially told no rooms were ready, but then they miraculously found a room that was. We were given directions on how to find it, but were not warned about the obstacle course we'd have to pass to reach it!!! Very poorly lit corridors, with unmarked slopes in the floor and unmarked steps resulted in me tripping and bashing my arm on a wall. When we eventually found the room, it had 3 single beds, when I'd booked a double bed. So back we went to reception. Guess what.... they don't have an accident book, and I couldn't see any details regarding their public liability insurance displayed anywhere. Despite this, I made a written statement about the accident, the receptionist signed it and I was given a copy, being assured the Security Officer would record details of the accident in the appropriate records. Personally, I'm not convinced this will happen. Although the receptionist was as helpful as she could be, it was clear the manager really didn't give a damn about his patrons - we overheard him telling the desk staff that he didn't care whether there were weddings going on, check in was at 3pm and not before, and it was tough if there weren't rooms ready when geusts arrived. Well anyway, we're now nearing 2pm - just about the time we needed to get the taxi to the wedding venue - and we're finally given what was described as 'a lovely room'. Yes it was clean, yes it was a double, but was it 'lovely'?... not as far as I am concerned! The room was at the front of the hotel, which faces onto a very busy road, and the windows were not even double glazed. The bathroom was functional at best - the plug hole in the sink was full of hairs, and the paint was peeling off, where the bathroom was quite clearly damp. Needless to say we did not spend more time than necessary in the room, choosing only to sleep in there, and we waited until we'd got home this morning to shower! My sister - the bride - suffered a similar, yet perhaps worse experience. She too had called on Friday to confirm an early check in, only to find, once she got there, that her room wasn't ready, and she had to put her wedding dress on in the hotel toilets!!!!!!

Disappointing that the milk on the tea/coffee tray in the room weren't topped up. Masses of power points in the room and the tv was pretty good.

When we got there (after many hours, we sailed from Cherbourg in France) in the evening, we had to wait because \"the rooms are being checked at this time\". We waited for half an hour and then asked them to please give us the room we booked 7 months ago because we were very tired. We soon found out that the staff there barely speaks English! They gave us a key to a room and when we got there the doors wouldn't open, we went downstairs two times to tell them and then they found you they forgot to put 1 in front of the room number, so we had been trying to go into the wrong room for a while. We finally opened the door on the correct room and let me tell you it was the worst I have ever seen! Here's what was wrong with it : 1. Two bunk beds! We booked a standard triple room seven month ago and they give us a room with two double bunk beds! 2.There were candy wraps on the floor and a lot of big stains. 3. The oven was set on max and couldn't be turned off. 4. In the bathroom the trash was full with tampons and gross stuff like that! 5. No T.V 6. One of the two lamps there didn't work 7. It was really really small 8. No chairs to sit on 9. The desk was falling apart and didn't have all the handles. 10. What we saw out of the window was a dump! 11. You could see rusty pipes out of the wall. 12. You had to flush the toilet about 5 times each time you used it. It takes one hour to go to Oxford Circus with a bus and about half an hour to go to the first underground station in Brixton with a bus.
