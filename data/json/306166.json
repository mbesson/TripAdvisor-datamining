During my recent stays I have at no point been dissatisfied and I would have no question about basing myself here in the future. This well-located hotel is readily accessible from the airport without encountering traffic and is located short metres away from Marina Square and Suntec City as well as the Esplanade MRT; the Esplanade district itself is a short stroll away. Taxis are almost always on call here in contrast to some other locations around town. The public areas are sharply executed and well-staffed. This is also reflected in the rooms - floor to ceiling windows let in plenty of natural light and sharp views. There is plenty of desk space and an expansive and tastefully-outfitted bathroom with quality toiletries. The executive lounge too performs well with pretty views across Marina Bay and a high-quality execution of the Hilton breakfast buffet and afternoon buffet, with a high-tea buffet to boot. Breakfast at Oscar's is on the extensive side (an ice-cream bar at breakfast? certainly complements the made-to-order waffles nicely). However it is in service that this hotel distinguishes itself. From the courteous and helpful check-in, where real upgrades are given happily and proactively, through to the restaurant staff, the business centre staff and housekeeping, the service is not just obliging but thoughtful and comfortable. I usually ask a lot of difficult questions of hotel staff but I was never disappointed with an answer I received here.

I keep going back to the Conrad and feeling like it is a good choice again and again. Note I am a Diamond at the Hilton chain so I get 99% of the time access to the executive lounge, free breakfast, and free internet. That makes a major difference in terms of pricing when compared with other hotels in this city ( I'd say a 80-100 SGD advantage ... ). What I absolutely love about the Conrad: 1. The breakfast is royal. I love it. The selection is great and of high quality. I just reviewed the Sheraton and the Conrad has a much much better breakfast. 2. The gym is well equipped, by the pool, and usually was not super busy. Maybe just my luck. 3. The bed is heaven. One of the best. 4. The view from the rooms is nice but not as good as that from the Ritz Carlton as that hotel has a view directly on the bay. The hilton is obstructed by the Mandarin. 5. Service is great for Diamond members. They truly make us feel 'special'. 6. The freebies from the HHonors program are truly valuable. 7. The location: so convenient and so many places where you can eat, read, shop, etc. 2 mins from the reception. The not so good: 1. The rooms are becoming tired and not large. Ritz has bigger ones. The Fullerton bay has similar ones. Some folks may not like the TV selection but it never bothered me as I rarely if ever watch TV: only when there is a football game I need to watch at 2 AM! To reassure folks: other hotels do not fare any better in terms of channel selection. The TV at the conrad is like a 40\" flat panel I think. 2. The price of non-corporate discounted rooms is on the high side: I'd go to the Fullerton Bay or Ritz if the prices are the same. My overall recommendation for SIngapore: Conrad Ritz Carlton Fullerton Bay Take the one where you can have a great price differential. Fullerton Bay is nice for non-business folks. Location is fine. What does it have over the Conrad? Room design is better but some may prefer the Conrad given the privacy in the bathroom. Ritz: take it if cheaper and want the better view. The rooms are better than at the Conrad in terms of space and quality. One final note: The executive lounge at the Conrad could do better in terms of a more relaxed atmosphere. It has great views but : 1. I always feel like I am entering a Hospital waiting room awaiting news whether a dear one died or not after surgery. A bit of a relaxed mood would help. Business folks are not that formal. 2. The amount of time when food and drinks are available is rarely suitable for business folks. Think about it management: many of us come from Europe or US. We rarely will leave the Singapore office at 6 PM to make it to your set schedule early in the evening. Something to consider to adjust to your clientelle. No, it is not about having dinner there as I see some guest doing. I end up rarely going to the club as it is never 'available' when I need it.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cDoes not remain in the mind ....\u201d", "Author": "BO777", "ReviewID": "UR126896694", "Content": "These dated rooms.

Normally I stay at the Mandarin oriental, but this time I decided to try new hotels, the Fullerton Bay (see other review) and the Conrad which is supposed to be the best the Hilton group offers. I stayed 4 nights in January 2012 in a \"Club or Executive\" room right after the CNY. I'm sorry to say that I find it hard to find anything that I liked about this hotel. Here are a few things: - the general \"style\" of the hotel is quite old fashioned (and not in a good way) and you get a feeling you could be anywhere in the world -the Club was not at all inviting, but really basic -the pool area is more like in a 3* hotel - I only ate once in the main restaurant, it was more of a buffet restaurant, but the only place that was open in the afternoon - the room was tiny even for one person and very basic -the bed was so high I had to get a little chair to climb on it (and I'm 1,63 meters tall) - they ask more $ for the airport limo transfer than the MO which is a more expensive hotel -for some weird reason the concierge gave my room number while making a dinner reservation at an outside restaurant, unacceptable! - you could choose your breakfast between a room service continental and the club buffet breakfast. However they tried to charge me for the room service continental!

Like always, a great hotel where every detail is well taken care. I enjoy my 2 days stay during the weekend. On Monday morning, when I about checked out, the hotel sent me a bill for pre-checking. I noticed there is an additional night charges on the bill. I ran to the duty manager to ask what the charges are about. He told me is one night charge for the reservation on the night before I arrived. I refuse to pay because my colleague who arrived a night earlier has informed the hotel that I will be only arrive the next day. The reception response, no problem \"we will take care about it\". I appealed that it is not right to charge for me for full room night and but I willing to pay 50% of it. After a long discussion with John Park, the duty manager. Last, he told me he will waive the charges and wish me to stay with them in future.

Therefore, I have been afforded the opportunity to stay, dine, attend conferences or some combination thereof at some of Asia's best hotels including: St. Regis (Beijing), Ritz Carlton (Bejing & Hong Kong), Four Seasons (Hong Kong), Grand Hyatt (Hong Kong & Macau), the Peninsula (Hong Kong), Shangri-la (Cebu and Hong Kong), JW Marriot (Hong Kong), and the Conrad (Hong Kong and Singapore), etc. I would like to think given my lodging experience at these fine establishments that I would know good service. With the Conrad Singapore, your experience will certainly be a good one. I have been there a number of times and the consistency of service has not degraded one bit. What I think they do there best is the hospitality - it is top-notch and on par or exceeding the level of detail and attention of other hotels within its peer group. My most recent stay was October of 2011 and I am looking forward to heading back in March. The check-in is pleasant and expediant, particularly if you are staying on the Executive Floor (which I highly recommend) as they have their own check-in counter. It's the little things that distinguishes great service from good service. The staff seem genuinely happy to serve you and go out of their way to meet your needs. For example, I like to read the Financial Times. In the executive lounge I asked for a copy. Then every morning thereafter whithout saying a word I was receiving the Financial Times delivered to my room. They also remember my drinking prefernce such as red wine or champagne every time I go to the Executive Lounge for a couple of drinks in the evening. Speaking of the excutive lounge, the food is quite good and they mix it up every day. In the morning you can grap a nice international breakfast with a selection of fresh juices and baked goodies. Afternoon tea set can really be thought of as either a lunch or dinnner as it is open buffet just like breakfast. Nice slection of finger foods / canapes and the desserts are delicious. The staff are always looking to fill your next glass of wine or champagne. The lounge is a great place to read a book, do some work or simply collect your thoughts. Some of the earlier comments about the building looking somewhat aged are valid, but that does not detract from the experience. While not as opulent as some of the other hotels I have stayed, you still get the sense that you are staying in a 5-star hotel. The rooms are wonderfully maintained though admittedly perhaps a bit on the smaller side.

I brought my sister & brother in law for the stay this time, being a Diamond member of the Hilton Honors, our rooms were automatically upgraded and we were able to use the lounge excess. We understand that the hotel were running full hence, our rooms were located on different floors. The Executive floor staffs were not as friendly as before, as i can't seem to recognize any one that was there anymore. On a better note, they had a better menu now for breakfast, afternoon tea & evening cocktails. Do book the Executive Floor room, cause the view from the lounge ,the service and the food up there is amazing. Do come by early as it can be very crowded especially in the evenings. Thank you to Mimi and Abar who were always so attentive to us. The room was very large with a king sized bed, very comfortable providing us a great night sleep. Next to the bed there is a control panel that took care of the lighting in the room as well as the do not disturb light on a panel outside the front door. There was a very large flat screen TV in the room as well as a built in entertainment center with radio and DVD player. The housekeeping would turn on the music from the DVD in the evenings, so do not be alarmed! The bathroom was large with a glassed in marble shower, full sized bathtub and sink. The hotel included every possible bathroom amenity and their toiletries smelled great. The lobby of the hotel is very large and impressive with many couches to sit on,listen to the tunes from a grand piano where someone played a few tunes in the evenings. Everyone one was always on smiles and ready to assists. We both were however very impressed with one of the lobby staff Yuana, she never fails to remember us! On one of the evenings when we just came back from dinner, i was surprised that someone greeted me by my name. And there she was, she had attended to us since three years ago when we first stayed at the Conrad . Previously, she was the one that took us up to our room and showed us the amenities. Last year when we came in for check-in, she was coincidentally on duty at the doors, saw us coming in and quickly made a phone call and whisked us up to the Executive Floor. We really felt welcomed and being remembered is a bonus since we only visit once a year. She gave us good dinner recommendations, sent us for great massage and always never fail to impress us. She is quick,attentive to our needs, gives good suggestions knowing our preference and always smiling. Not only a hotel staff but she makes us feel very welcomed and also like a good friend. We are definitely looking forward to see her again next year as she always makes us feel at home.

The rate at that time was not particularly competitive but that was the case with basically all the hotels in Singapore at that time. Arrival I arrived here by taxi from the airport and the welcome at the reception area was quite warm with quite a friendly attendant present and I was later escorted to the lift and then to the room with a full explanation of the room features being made later. I was told that I had been upgraded to a higher level and the immediate higher category of room but the room still seemed to be very similar to the usual rooms advertised on the hotel website and it was on the smaller side. I had requested a non-connecting room but that could not be arranged and my room was connected to another through a door next to the TV and in front of the luggage rack. It did appear, though, that this style of room was what could be expected for a twin-bed Executive, as it was in the same style as advertised on the hotel website and perhaps connecting rooms are the only ones available in this category. The Room The room was in an older style and not hugely complicated or filled with various tech features as far as hotel rooms go these days. There were no impressive lighting features such as found in the St. Regis in Singapore, for example. It was also a little old and worn but still quite well-maintained The bed was very comfortable and the linens had a high thread count so were also quite comfortable and felt soft on the skin. The bedhead design and look was really quite simple. The sofa chair was comfortable but looked a little generic and simple. The bathroom was quite large with very large oversize mirrors within and the \u2018Anystream\u2019 showerhead really did produce a large variety of water streams. The toiletries provided were of a high quality and generously proportioned. The bathtub wasn\u2019t particularly large and it took a while to fill because of the weak water stream coming from the tap. The water stop in the bathtub was a little odd and not the usual type; it was operated from outside the bath and I was concerned whether it might be the best from a hygienic point of view as it didn\u2019t seem possible to wash it directly. Another problem with the bathroom was the slightly dirty or darkened grout in parts of the bathroom, especially the shower area, which shouldn\u2019t really happen in a hotel at this level and could have been mould or mildew. All things considered, it seemed like it was time for a general bathroom overhaul by the look of things. The TV in the room was quite impressive, being a large LCD Sony system with excellent picture and sound quality, being particularly clear and there was also a dvd player included as well as a large selection of channels available. The soundproofing in the room was more than adequate and even though they couldn\u2019t provide a non-connecting room and only had a connecting one available, nothing could really be heard from the connecting room and it was also quite well sound-proofed from the traffic which was on the street level, although it was a higher-level room. Complimentary pralines were provided in the room as a welcome amenity but I thought it would have been even better if these were replenished daily because hotels do replenish fruits in the rooms when provided and perhaps the chocolates should also be refilled. There was no free internet in the room officially but there was an option to select the free 15 minutes worth of internet and to continually reselect the option when the allotted time had run out. The room provided a medium-sized safe, not the largest in a hotel room but larger than some of those which can only fit a small laptop. My room had quite a nice view out over to the fountain at the Suntec towers and over the expressway in that area as well as of the towers themselves. The fountain looked more impressive at night when it was lit in a variety of colours. As I recall, my room had no iron or ironing board provided except on request but fortunately, the rate included some complimentary pressing. Videos of the room can be found through my profile section. Staff Service There was ice provided in the room after the turndown in the evening and the range of teas available was also more than usually provided and of higher quality too. All of my newspaper requests were met in the morning. I tried the in-room dining once and the attendants on the phone and bringing the meal were friendly. The meal itself was also quite good, confirming the quality that I have so far experienced in Hilton hotels as far as the in-room dining meals. Hotel Facilities Breakfast was provided in a sort of private area next to the pool and although it was definitely a very quiet, cosy and private dining area relative to that provided in most hotels, the choice of food for the buffet was also quite limited. Service was also only just acceptable and the staff there didn\u2019t seem that friendly on the two times I had breakfast there with the exception of one staff member. The hotel did not have any jacuzzi or sauna facilities but a spa service was available and the gym was well-equipped with a wide variety of new equipment. Location The hotel\u2019s location was very convenient for shopping and dining, as it was basically on top of the Millenia Walk Shopping Centre and close to the Marina Square Shopping Mall, which had quality dining available as well as a foodcourt. The Suntec shopping centre was also closeby with a few more dining options in the basement levels of one of the towers including another large foodcourt as well as many restaurants. The Esplanade and Promenade MRT stations are also nearby and connect with other MRT lines which go to many other parts of the island. Conclusion Overall, it was a good experience here. The room quality perhaps was not the best that can be found now but the service levels were generally very good. Just as a quick comparison for illustration, the rooms here were not as impressive as at the St. Regis Singapore but the service levels were better. In any case, I felt that the hotel had more of an old-style homely feel to it which made for a comfortable and relaxing experience. The main issues were the high rates at the time and the fact that my request for a non-connecting room could not be met. Overall, I would give the hotel a 4.5 out of 5.

The location seems to be very conveniently located and for a change hopping into taxis did not pose a major problem even during peak hours (unlike my stays at other comparable hotels in Singapore).As can be well appreciated, a critical convenience for most business travellers to Singapore is the ready availability of taxis from hotels specially during peak hours.I do not know how many hotel reviews bring out this factor of ready taxi availability (and I am not referring to the hotel provided taxis which are quite expensive compared to public taxis) but in this context the Conrad Centennial was quite a revelation. Another aspect to note is the high quality of the live music provided at the lobby level of the hote.It was pure bliss after returning in the evening from meetings and listening to (and watching) the highly talented ensemble late till the night.A noticable aspect of the music on an acoustics basis was the fact that it did not seem to be so loud to prevent any meaningful conversation to take place.In some of the other hotels featuring live music in the lobby,it is often quite difficult to carry on a proper conversation.Not so in the case of the Conrad Centennial. if there was a a discordant note,I found it to be in the final bill that I received in which I was charged twice for the same room and for the same date.Obviously the reception counter forgot to destroy the credit card charge-slip which one normally submits on arrival (to ensure guaranteed payment) when checking in.As a matter of abundant caution I would advise fellow travellers to always insist that their original credit card charge-slips are either returned to them or disposed off in their presence at the time of actual check out.This will eliminate considerable inconvenience later on and this applies to all hotels.

Had breakfast In Oscars each day and again, the monotony of choice is the striking feature. Asian selection was very poor on most days. Had buffet dinner 1 night for S$78 plus tax which is hardly cheap for what's on offer and why is there a 10% service charge for a self-serve buffet? Had the buffet at Raffles the night before which was far superior and cheaper and didn't have young children running around out of control. Food at the Golden Peony overpriced and very ordinary.

While tired I was immediately impressed by the customer service even at that late hour. The bellman whisked our bags away and we were taken to the front desk by another representative. Despite the late hour the folks at the customer service desk were very chipper and welcomed us to the hotel. My status was recognized and we received an upgrade to a business class room, which included $S20 in free laundry service each day, 1 hour of conference room time on the business floor daily, shoe shine service and fresh fruit daily in the room. The front desk agent just didn't just give us our keys - she took us up to our room on the 30th floor and showed us the amenities. She also shared with us that since it was Christmastime there was a small teddy bear in the room as well as a rubber ducky in the bathroom that we could take with us when we left. These are very nice touches. The room was very large with a king sized bed. The bed was too hard for my liking, but still afforded a great night sleep. Next to the bed there is a control panel that took care of the lighting in the room as well as the do not disturb light on a panel outside the front door. This light got us into trouble once as we forgot it was on. The room was not serviced and our laundry was not delivered. But even with that when we called down for our laundry not only did they deliver, but they did refresh the whole room while we were at a late dinner. Excellent service! There was a very large flat screen TV in the room as well as a built in entertainment center with radio and DVD player. The bathroom was large with a glassed in marble shower, full sized bathtub and generous sink. The hotel included every possible bathroom amenity and replaced them daily. The closet had plenty of space but the safe was so small that a laptop with anything greater than a 12\" screen would not fit. There was also a very nice sized table to conduct business at - but we were there to tour around. The room overlooked the fountain of wealth and we were entertained by the nightly show at the fountain. We received free breakfast every morning. We were told we could have buffet breakfast at the pool lounge or at the restaurant in the hotel, Oscar\u2019s. If they give you a choice - choose Oscar\u2019s every time. The selections are much better and the service was as well. We took advantage of the $S20 free laundry - the free daily allowance isn't even enough to get a suit done but it took care of several of our items and I was impressed with the quick turnaround. Every night we received turn down service. I wasn\u2019t expecting it and it was nice to come back and have music playing as you walked into the room. The lobby of the hotel is very large and impressive with many couches to lounge on, a bar and a grand piano where occasionally someone played a few tunes. Because of the holiday season there was a fun Christmas tree made out of Conrad Teddy Bears. I was impressed. The hotel is conveniently located directly across the street from a mall where you can get a variety of gifts and there is a large food court with many selections. The mall also has the main stopping point for the hop on hop off bus which took us all over the city. The subway is about a 3 minute walk away from the hotel. On our last day I took advantage of an hour of time in the business lounge. The lounge opens early and is open until 11PM. I was escorted to a private suite with a computer, printer other office supplies and even breath mints. I needed to print a few things for the last leg of my trip and got it all done quickly. The front desk agent even gave me a nice envelope to store my printed pages. Overall this was a magnificent hotel. There was just one minor issue. I found the hallways in the hotel to be very warm. This time of year Singapore is in the 80s with high humidity. A couple of times I found myself overheated in the hallway on the way to the elevator. That is my only issue. Otherwise this was a fantastic stay and I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat Rooms, Great Location\u201d", "Author": "WorldTraveller674", "ReviewID": "UR123104001", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights back in June 2010.

I tend to look for negative things when ever I step foot in a hotel, I can honestly say I had a very hard time finding anything negative about the property. The Conrad Centennial Singapore is located within the business, historical, cultural and shopping districts of Marina Bay. Across from the Suntec Singapore \u2013 Convention and Exhibition Centre with access to shops and restaurants. A 20-minute drive from Singapore Changi International Airport, Sentosa Island, the Singapore Expo and a short walk to The Singapore Flyer. This was only my 3rd Conrad experience, in the past I was a guest at the Conrad Brussels and Istanbul. Both of these hotels did not meet my expectation, as a luxury brand in the Hilton Family, to me they were just Hilton hotels with the Conrad name. However the Conrad in Singapore just kept pleasing me over and over. Check In: Getting out of the taxi I was greeted by 2 hotel staff opening the doors for us on each side of the car, there was a 3rd staff member who had all our bags on a cart, he kindly asked my name. I was escorted to the front desk, the doorman got the door for us. The front desk was fully staffed with smiles, I gave my name and flashed my Hilton Diamond card, the agent quickly walked from behind the desk and escorted us to the executive level check in. When we arrived I was greeted by name and all the paperwork was ready. After a quick copy of the passport, we had the keys. Walked into the suite to find our luggage already there, very impressive. The Suite: Named the Centennial Suite, was a very nice size, with living room, bedroom, and very large and well appointed bathroom. The suite was on one of the corners of the building providing some cool views. Fresh flowers were placed in the room daily. I was impressed with the size of the SONY LCD TV in the living room, and the A/V connection panel with universal plug that would take most any plug type (why don\u2019t more hotels have this?!?) The bed room was a good size. I really liked the bathroom, a nice glass inclosed shower, tub & duel sink vanity. The toilet was in it\u2019s own spacious room. There was also a Conrad rubber ducky in the bathroom, and two bottles of Conrad Singapore branded water. The amenities in the bathroom, included the shampoos, conditioner, bars of soap... but the extras were toothbrushes, loofah, combs, shaving kits, sowing kit, and more.. The Executive lounge: The lounge was very nice with table service all day, the drinks kept flowing. The food selection at night was varied and hight quality. The staff in the lounge took pride as they set up the food service. It was kept full and clean. The lounge was a nice size with some really nice views. Internet in the lounge (wireless) was free. Good service and staff made this lounge very enjoyable. Doorman: I never opened the door to the hotel myself. I was greeted with a smile and a hello each time I was coming or going. When walking out, the staff outside always asked if we needed a map or helping finding something. I was very happy with my stay, the staff was just top of the top. Friendly, helpful, personable, knowledgeable & caring.. You could not ask for any better.. The hotel is run very well..

We were brought to the Execfloor for high tea to quell our famine struck body. It was a relief ! Tho, my HM & I expects the usual smiles, proper greets, clean rooms n the whatnots of a 5 Star Hotel, I was taken by surprise for the next 72 hours on the staffs work ethics and camaraderie. Our late arrival was met with a personal HANDwritten letter with an apology from their Manager, ensued with Chocolates on Day 2. A Book Marker on my pillow top Which blown me away cus I was reading a book n din have the proper book marker, I jus used the MRT card to mark my last read pages. We were given late check outs @4pm promptly when we requested and knew these guys are sincere in their approach of treating us, the customers right. Most Hotels would have made us wait another 1 hour for escalation of cases n most will come back a Disappointment n made to feel being Ripped having check in later. Water bottles n toiletries regularly checked and replenished without us having to ask, and coming back in the evening after dinner to find the bed ready for sleep, with water n glass ready on bed side table, and the fluffy sandals placed in proper place is simply Amazing! There's also a Pillow Menu with over 10 types of pillow to choose from! I cudnt really sleep well on first night trying the softer pillow, but having changed to a firmer pillow, I awoke the next day thinking I was @ home n soon mistakenly got myself ready for work, NOT until I opened the curtain that Reality struck I am still on Holiday... Phew! All in all, it has been an Awesome experience with Conrad and the best way to start 2012. To readers n decision planners on where to stay next in Singapore town, give it a go... To the EDM picking up my story, pls extend my sincerest congratulation on your success in giving the best customer experience in the service industry. Staffs being staff on a normal payroll, you deserve a pat on the back. You have given me so much during my stay, inspiring me to give this much back to you in hopes Service standards like this prevail and become a Benchmark both in Singapore & Malaysia. To the management, you hit the pot of gold, and don't change your philosophy. It's in the right track. I found it once in Club Med but soon because of management change... The experience collapsed.

As with many international hotels there is little to remind the guest of where in the world they are staying, but, -- there are enough subtle reminders that you are not in London, Paris or New York. Without exception I found everyone willing, polite and anxious to make my stay memorable. Rooms are of a good standard with many extra amenities, plenty of work space, decent choice of TV even a choice of bathrobes. Instead of a chocolate on the pillow at turndown I got a box. Spoilt slightly perhaps as I had paid a bit extra for a room on a high executive floor. If you intend doing a few touristy things the open top sightseeing buses start from the convention centre just across the road. There is also a pretty good \u2018food court\u2019 there with a good selection of ethnic delicacies, also direct access to one of the air-conditioned shopping malls.

However, the hotel lacks a distinctive feature that would help it rise above its local competitors. The location is central but not ideal. The surrounding area is of no particular interest and the Suntec mall is downmarket compared to others. The colonial district is a good 15 minutes walk: either boring in underground passes, or sweaty in the Singapore heat. The situation has improved with the opening of the Promenade and Esplanade subway stations, but they are on the less convenient Circle Line. As it is, one has to rely on taxis to commute to places of business or entertainment. The lobby and the common areas are cool and shady; all noise is efficiently absorbed and the guests seem to conform to the ambient quietness by avoiding to raise their voice; as a result, the whole place seems to lack pulse. Service is attentive and friendly but tends to be a bit slow, particularly on check-in and check-out. The strong point of the hotel is the rooms: large, with modern equipment and classy decoration, very comfortable. On this front however, the Conrad finds itself outclassed by its neighbour, the luxurious Ritz-Carlton.

We were not disappointed at all. From the very warm welcome to the minute we left the hotel we were greeted with smiles everywhere. The staff is fantastic. The lobby lounge is nice and relaxing with a good atmosphere. They serve nice cocktails and snacks and have a lovely afternoon tea. Outside they have a champagne bar with happy hours and some light snacks. We loved the miniburger and springrolls! We did not have breakfast included but ordered room service twice and we were very satisfied with our breakfast. The order was efficient and accurate and the coffee was really tasty. Loved it! We stayed on the 25th floor with views of the harbour and financial district. Possibly the view is nicer here than on the other side of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable and quite high so you slept like royalty. The surrounding area is nice with shopping centers and quite a few restaurants and there are walk ways aroung the bay, perfect also for jogging. If you would like to get on a Hop on Hop off bus, they are parked just across the street from the hotel. It is a great way to see the sights and they have several different routes you can take. The tickets are valid 24 hr, so you can see the city both during the day and late afternoon. We had booked airport transfer with the hotel and it was very convenient to have a driver waiting at the airport. The drive is just 15-20 minutes, so it was worth it although it is a lot cheaper with shuttle bus or underground. But we didn\u00b4t want to carry our luggage, and then I guess you pay for the service:-) Oscars restaurant served good food and a buffet every day, which we didn\u00b4t eat. But the a la carte menu was good and the Angus steak fantastic. Try and get a table by the window or perhaps outside to get a bit more privacy. It seems buffet dinners are very popular for families. All in all, we had a wonderful stay. The only thing we would like to see a bit nicer is the pool area and the sun beds there. The area could be more cosy, even though they have made it okay. Perhaps nicer umbrellas and sunbeds, and more green plants would make it better. However the staff in the pool bar was fantastic and the food very tasty.

I\u2019ve bunked at the Shang Valley Wing, the Shang Sentosa, the Grand Hyatt, the Sheraton, the Intercon, Swissotel/Westin Stamford, Fairmont/Raffles Plaza\u2026 and others. \u2026until I stumbled onto the Conrad. Since then, I\u2019ve not darkened the door of any other hotel\u2026 and I have no need to. I had two visits to the Conrad on this trip, and it's still possibly the best managed hotel in Asia/Pacific, this is a hotel which is both warm and also crisply efficient. Whether it\u2019s pressing a jacket or printing pages, things here happen effortlessly, and with a smile. The rooms are spacious, but it\u2019s the beds that differentiate it\u2026 especially those high density feather pillows. One of these days, I\u2019m going to break down and buy two pillows to take home (they\u2019re available in the giftshop for SGD160 each!). Easily the best sleeps I have outside my own bed are at the Conrad. Recently, they upgraded the bathroom amenities to Acca Kappa... Did I take the leftovers with me? Yes, I did. Oscar\u2019s, the all day/night dining is nice, although I think the buffet is a bit overpriced. Plus there are numerous restaurants around the hotel, so you\u2019re not out for food choices. (Try Bel Mondo, across the parking lot for nice Italian) Since I\u2019m Diamond level, I get upgraded to Exec Lounge access, and that just makes life better. A large lounge, with good distance between tables, and it\u2019s open late. Impressive breakfast, and you can certainly substitute a lounge visit for dinner if you wish. Excellent wine selection\u2026 usually 3-4 very nice whites and 3-4 very nice reds, and usually a high end Champagne. (More hotels could learn from this\u2026 I\u2019ve been to too many JWMs or Grand Hyatt\u2019s where the wine is plonk\u2026 not the Conrad.)

It is first of all convenient for me being close to my company office in the Centennial Tower but it is also a favourite in its own right. My corporate association with the hotel gets me into the executive lounge which obviously makes me positively disposed to the hotel. It is a wonderful experienced after a long flight being escorted immediately on arrival to the separate executive lounge check in and if on the rare occasion there is a delay on registering tea, coffee or anything else you want in the way of refreshments are immediately provided. There is pretty stiff competition in Singapore among hotels so when I talk about a favourite I am talking about something special. The nearby Mandarin is also first class and if anything its service is even more personal but a little too over the top for me. The Conrad has the right balance but this is a personal preference. I have seen one comment that the rooms aren't big but the standard rooms are about average for 5 star hotels in Singapore. I have also seen a comment about the high price of rooms and this is true but again the rate is similar to the 5 star hotels in this area and about half the price of Raffles and cheaper than the new Marina Sands. It is really a cost benefit equation so when I get a good breakfast, cocktails and the rest in the mix I still see the price as competitive in the market segment.

What s/he had to say about the electrical outlets is spot on. Very very few and you have to sit down in a chair to dry your hair because your only option is by the TV and the plug is so low to the ground and cord so little that you can't stand and do it. So, that does bug a bit. I think because the property is older...that it has few outlets. I'm actually surprised during the re-model (looks like it was re-modelled about 8-10 years ago) that they didn't add more outlets. Maybe the infrastructure wiring wouldn't support it and was way too costly to change the infrastructure....i dunno. The rooms are nice and spacious but besides the 46\" Sony HD TV, it's not as modern as many of the other 5 star hotels I've stayed at in Asia. For instance, the curtains and shades are all manual. A bit rough as they've planted the work desk directly in front of the curtains. The carpet is high quality berber (with nice padding) but not the thick artfully designed carpets you see like they have in the walkways and lobby and like most 5 star Asian hotels have in the guest rooms. It's like a variation of tan and matches with completely tan chairs made of light wood. So, it becomes very bland very quickly -- too matchy matchy. Clearly a gay man did not decorate this joint. Haha! They need to hire a gay dude!! But if you compare it to Hiltons in the states, it's quite definitely 1 to 1.5 stars higher in service, quality, and decor. Plus the bed was SO comfortable as were the high thread count lilnens. I got upgraded to an executive room and the lounge is uber posh. Probably tied with JW Marriott in Mumbai as the nicest executive lounge I've ever been in. Tasteful and plush carpets and art. I'm gonna give the award to JW Marriott due to its size (roughly 3,500 square feet and options for seating) but this one isn't far behind. There were fireworks last night and you could see them SO well from the 31st floor executive lounge. The wine there was of good quality and the food items were also quite nice for a nosh. The lobby is very opulent and the service is friendly, kind, and sincere. I had housekeeping bring me an iron this morning and before she came in the front desk called me and said that the housekeeper was outside my room but could not knock as my \"DND\" light was on. Nice touch. I let her in promptly and apologized. Haven't eaten the food. There is a substantially sized food stall in a mall across from the hotel (where you get on the hop on hop off buses) and the food there is terrific plus it's SO much cheaper. It's actually affordable. That's saying something in a country in which a Big Mac is approx. $7 USD and a Heineken beer at a bar is about $14 USD. OUCHERS!! I'd stay at this property again, being a Hilton Gold member. The hotel is adjacent to the Mandarin and the Pan Pacific. The PP hotel, from the exterior, seems to be more posh than either this property or the Mandarin...they definitely have a nicer pool than the Hilton....but....don't know about the rooms until i actually can see into them! My hope is that they'll modernize the decor in the next 5 years. Right now it's very 1998 Old Money decor. Get hip, Conrad! I've seen some of your other properties.

Plasma tv was refreshing the impression in a way, but the room did not look like a business room in a 5* star hotel. The hardest time I had \u2013 was with sockets.

I wouldn't hesitate booking this hotel again, but perhaps families with young children should steer away, unless you are after a more sophisticated 5* experience. This hotel, whilst still 5*, is at the upper end of this scale and therefore not as leisurely as, say, the Marriot or sister property, the Hilton, which I'd say are standard 5* properties in comparison.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cGood service, great location\u201d", "Author": "Roberto275", "ReviewID": "UR115829695", "Content": "Centralized location near to office buildings, great shopping mall (suntec nearby) and a short walk to the newly build marina bay sands area Stayed here numerous times and the service is always impeccable.

I have stayed at several of the 5 star hotels in the Lion City, this one just has that little bit extra. The staff are great, and always welcome you back to the hotel on arrival. Rooms are spacious, beds soft, and if cleanliness really is next to godliness, then the domestic staff really deserve halos. Bathrooms are huge and well stocked. The views from the higher floors of the hotel, especially at night, are great. Location: opposite Suntec and the convention centre. There are two huge shopping malls in the immediate vicinity, and several smaller ones within minutes of walking. A new MRT station has now opened since my last visit, and is accesible though an underground tunnel from Suntec. I stayed on the executive floor; love being spoiled with their afternoon cocktails and snacks, and to judge by the amount of people who were in the lounge during cocktail hour, so do a lot of other people. And here's one huge, huge plus; children under the age of 12 are not allowed in the lounge! It's not that I am a child-hater by any means, but for me the mix of alcohol in free flow and small children just doesn't quite gel. Ate breakfast in the lounge one day, and downstairs in the restaurant the two other days simply because I love the choice that is on offer down their (including nasi lemak).

Well located in the Suntec City complex of shops, office buildings and hotels, the hotel is in a great location for not only this area but also central to the financial area, Marina Bay Sands, Clarke Quay and more. First Impressions: * Great location/easy to/from Airport..Suntec City etc etc * Grand lobby and very attentive valet/doorman etc * Check in was courteous (a little disorganised for my particular reservation but it was a last minute reservation so it hadn't hit their system properly)(was asked to join Hilton Honours despite my # being on file! etc.) Room: * Not huge but spacious. Nice clean/modern/functional bathroom with separate tub and shower. * Modern flat screen tv, central lighting etc.. * Good work desk facing out the window and highly functional. * Con: Another hotel that doesn't seem to have 'preferred' floors for it's status members or for Exec Lounge guests..so you could stay on the top floor or the bottom one and still have the same access and room type..very odd considering most hotels reserve their top floors for their top guests etc. Bathroom: * Not huge/not small..just right! * Seperate bath and shower (with good pressure) * No complaints Executive Lounge: * Top floor..amazing views * Upscale but not overly so. * Very generous 'all day' drinks (including alcohol)..quite unusual for most Exec Lounges. * Great service and despite getting quite busy later in the evening, service always regular and professional. * TIP: Arrive at 5:30 or close to it to get the preferred tables by the windows! Pool & Gym: * Open to guests and public 'members' (not great and makes busy times even busier!) * Decent machines although they look a bit dated. * Chairs are a bit cheap but otherwise great pool area with plenty of space. * Wonderful bar staff..very attentive and accommodating! (Tip: Chicken/Mango wrap is delicious!!) * Good strong WiFi signal out around the pool * Poolside food service was great.

However, around this area are other hotels surrounding the Marina Square mall (mid-scale), the Sunted City mall and is not too far from the new Marina Bay Sands hotel and shopping mall (with high end as well). I like the understated elegance of the Conrad; It is positioned as the more luxurious brother of the Hilton and rightly so as the staff is more professional and attentive without being overly familiar. However, with the recent renovation of the Hilton on Orchard Road, that hotel now charges higher than the Conrad. I believe that has also something to do with the Conrad beginning to show its age, which is why I rate it a 4 instead of a 5. But the service here is dependable. A tip on the bedding. I don't know why hotels in Asia insist on placing duvets on the bed when it is warm here in the region thus requiring airconditioning.

The rooms are nice, clean and well maintained but the room ssize does not seem to be anywhere close to what appears on the pictures online. The stay was without breakfast as breakfast for an indian vegetarian at propmotional cost of 30++ SGD is too high as one can easit get decent meal for about 10-12 SGD at near by sun tech restaurants. The staff was courteous and room service slow. House keeping was good and the hotel had all the basic amenities, It was surprising that the hotel does not have a decent health club with sauna steam or jacuzzi. At about 300++ SGD i would rather suggest Pan pacific to those who want to stay at this location or at 250++ carlton, Goodwood, peninsula, would be better choices as one can get cheaper or complimentary breakfast there. Intercontinental with bugis street shops and plaza would also be a good choice, My advice to tourist would be not to get carried away by advertised rooms sizes as in terms of carpet area, rooms are pretty much the same size in all these hotels.

A colouring book set was in the room awaiting her. Executive Lounge - no kids policy - but allowed us to book the meeting room so we can enjoy the exec lounge with our young daughter with us. They had food offering at breakfast (you can swap it for the breakfast at the main restaurant which offered so much more choice), 2-5pm afternoon tea and 530pm - 8pm canapes. The seating for us with our daughter in tow, was in a private sofa lounge room or a dining area that was attached to the meeting room. It was more private than sitting in the main exec lounge. M-Fri they had a free morning taxi shuttle at 730am and 830am into the CBD. My husband found this useful to get to work as he didn't have to join the long morning taxi queues with other hotel guests. Depending on which side you exit the Conrad hotel, but for the Suntec shopping centre/ tour compayy counter (and departure point for Duck bus/boat tour and and open top sight seeing bus), you just had to walk across the road. If you take the Conrad exit on the other side, Millenium? Walk shopping mall (not great) is infront of you. That is linked to the Marina Mall (great shops/restaurants). AThe MRT is a minute's walk (if that) and an underpath that takes you right into Suntec City Shopping mall. If you have a stroller, look out for the lift to the underpath opposite the Conrad. Before I booked, I hesitated staying at the Conrad due to their no kids policy in their exec lounge but I went with it anyway based on location for touring, shopping..and with the hope of getting a Mandarin Oriental/Four Seasons quality & service. It certainly delivers and I am pleased we stayed here. We did the Fairmont before arriving at the Conrad, and the food quality in the Conrad's executve lounge is much, much better. Also for the same room category (one bedroom suite), Conrad's suite was by far bigger, newer and cheaper than for what we paid at the Fairmont.

Many things has changed and i prefer the City Hall rather to the Orchard shopping district as it was away from the hustle & bustle. Conrad in a small hotel compared to the surrounding hotels however the service was certainly excellent. I had slight issues with the reception as i came on an early flight at around 9am and the rooms were not ready yet. When requested for a best view, they told me that all their view is nice and when requested for a king bed, they told me a request was a request and it was subjected to availability. The reception did not even try to check in her computer, her answers came very spontaneously. The check in process was very slow despite the number of staff that they had behind the check in area. Since my room was not ready, i was assisted to a shower and changing area by a lady name yuana from the concierge counter. I would not know that conrad offer a changing and shower area if i had not asked for a map, the reception counter staff did not take the initiative to ask me if i needed any assistance. Since i was on business and only had the evenings and weekends free, she gave me very good suggestions on how to maximize the opportunity with the little time i had. Her knowledge about the surrounding area, the culture and the attractions was truly admirable. She was always cheerful and polite. On one of the free evenings that i had,I was recommended to try the night safari by the same lady , instead of whisking me into a taxi, she took time to explain that there are other way to get to the Night Safari. Since i was alone, i took on her advice on taking the zoo bus that was a 5min walking away from the hotel. As i was new to the area, she even showed me the way to the cash machine and later walked me to the area. Another gentleman, Roy also made me felt really welcomed he always greeted me and asked how my day was. This was one of the best business trip that i had. Both the staffs made me feel very comfortable in a new place.They were very warm and sincere. The suggestions that she gave me like visiting the Botanical gardens, having my lunch at Maxmel Market, the night safari and having my jog at the east coast park on the weekend had allowed me feel like i was on a holiday. Although the room that i got was a twin bed, the view however was stunning it was the marina view on the 20th floor. They also had fruits and chocolates in the room. A plus point was the gym was open 24hrs.

SERVICE: From the moment we arrived at Reception, consistently throughout our stay until the day we checked out, the attentive staff were top class and nothing was too much trouble or a problem. We met some staff we had come to know who walked to our taxi chatting to us and to say good-bye - we were made to feel special. QUALITY: Our room furnishings, linen, bathroom amenities; all were spot on. Special touches: e.g. a linen mat with our bathroom slippers placed at each side of the bed each day. The bathroom was fully replenished and spotlessly cleaned daily which also made it a very comfortable stay. The ice bucket was filled late afternoon every day, very convenient. Dry Cleaning was always ready overnight.. Oh yes, the Buffet Breakfast (included) absolutely fresh and great variety - impeccable service! LOCATION: MRT, Suntec, Singapore Flyer, Marina Square Mall, MileniaWalk Shopping Mall, Marina Bay Sands and lots more are all within walking distance. Great restaurants surround the hotel (& within the hotel, including great room service). SHOPPING: We shopped at Suntec (opposite the hotel) with every store you need, including a supermarket and lots of restaurants, cafes. Use the close by MRT to go to shopping malls on Orchard Road, i.e. Paragon, Tangs, Mandarin Central etc.; Little India and the Mustafa Centre (24 hr. shopping & it gets crazy) perfume, electronics, clothes - everything! GENERAL: Walk down to the Singapore Flyer and visit the Kenko Fish Spa. A great experience with the little fish nibbling the skin on your feet.

Housekeeping twice a day and I mean complete housekeeping made the staff very relaxing. On arrival there were truffles and fresh fruit is replenished daily. Some guests have commented on the configuration of the TV but we really didn't mind. The screen is huge so the fact that it is on a side wall is not really an issue. Concierge service was also seamless. Forgotten eyeglasses on the plane and dinner reservations were handled quickly and more importantly effortlessly. We didn't have to worry about a thing. We only sampled poolside food and the late dinner menu at the bar. Extremely high quality. Have the Oscar burger. It's worth it. AS well the house wine is well chosen and the poolside attendant while not only charming was knowledgeable about the wine. We used the gym every day. It was never crowded and perfectly adequate. The machines all have TVs and it is a good incentive to keep exercising. We don't have the Hallmark Channel or DIVA here in Tokyo so some days I exercised longer I enjoyed watching so much. The gym's staff are extremely attentive and friendly. The gym has bottled water, juice and cold towels. Nice touches. As for sun, it is now around 1 PM poolside but if you move the chaise to the back balcony one can get the sun from around 10. Finally not one staffmember failed to greet us or open a door.

After a few rounds including getting someone to fix the aircon, we were granted our request to be transferred to another room.

His service was once again execellent and impeccable. The other staff we were served by was excellent in their own ways too. But I just want to highlight 2 grouses I had for this time: Pressing of items Offered complimentary to us at part of the package. It had slipped our minds and by the time we remembered, it was close to midnight. I called the concierge to enquire if the offer is still valid, and it was. I was asked what time could they return the pressed items, and I told them anytime the next morning is okay, to which I recieved an affirmation on. By about 12pm the next day, I still didnt get my items so I called the concierge again but this time was told that because I did not request for the express service, I would only get my items back at 7pm, which is after my check-out time. I told the lady so, and finally she said by 6pm then, in accordance to my checkout time. I had to call again at 5:30pm to ask for it before I eventually got them back. This small miscommunication ended up being frustrating because I was given different information that led to false expectations. Even more so, I had to contend with my sleep-wear Tshirt on the whole of the 2nd day because of this. Pine nuts offered at the Executive Lounge My guest and I are experienced the 'pine mouth syndrome' which is the experiencing of a bitter taste in the mouth which is caused by apparently certain types / species of pine nuts, and can last anything from a few days to a few weeks.

Sadly, our experience did not live up to our expectations. Although we did find a few of the service failures rather humorous! Tried to check-in at the front desk and were told after a few minutes of phones calls we had to go to the Executive Lounge for check-in. Arrived there and other guests were waiting to check in with the single receptionist. Other staff encouraged us to take a seat in the lounge and they would come for us. They never did and we returned to the desk \u2013 that was now empty of other guests. The receptionist looked up and said, \u201cOh, are you waiting to check-in?\u201d Not a good start. My partner and I had reserved a King, non-smoking Executive level room for two adults (I even noticed the same information on the file she pulled to process our check-in). I had also requested a Hilton standby upgrade for an additional $75.00 per night at the time of booking. After taking our passports and beginning the paperwork, she says \u2013 very matter of fact \u2013 \u201cI have a twin nonsmoking room for you\u201d \u2013 as though we weren\u2019t supposed to notice, Upon pointing out we had booked a king room, she tossed out the old \u2018we can\u2019t guarantee a king bed at check-in\u2019 response and made no reference to the upgrade request. I asked about the standby upgrade and was told that the upgraded rooms were not available. Seeing that I was not happy, she suggested a twin room for the first night and king room the next night. That was not acceptable as it would mean we would have to change rooms instead of sightseeing in the middle of the day. She then suddenly found a Premium smoking room and stated that \u2018people don\u2019t usually smoke in the smoking rooms\u2019. I declined and decided to just take the twin room. Maid service was the most comical area during our stay. The first evening, while at dinner, the maid provided a turn down service for only one of the two beds. One turned bed, one bottle of water on the night stand, one set of slippers, etc\u2026! Although a very minor point, it was rather funny considering our earlier issue with the twin vs. king bed at check-in. We left the room at 8:30A the following morning, returned mid-afternoon and the room was not cleaned. Went to the pool for awhile and the retuned at 3:30p and the room was not cleaned. Went out again and came back at 4:15P and the maid was just finishing up. A little late in the day? Went to the lounge for cocktails at 5:30P (turned the privacy light on) and returned at 6:30P to find a note under the door explaining they could not provide turn down service because of the do not disturb light. Understandable, but they had just finished cleaning the room less than two hour before! Why not just turn down the bed when you cleaned the room? Turned the privacy light off, went to dinner and came back at 9:30P. The maid, to her credit, must have come back around and provided the turn down service since the privacy light was now off. But again\u2026for only one bed! They had just made up two beds a few hours earlier. Does the house cleaning staff not have a list of how many guest are in each room? Again, some minor issues, but for a hotel at the level of Conrad, in one of the most competitive hotel cities in the world, you come to have much higher expectations.

Than, at arrival they gave me a letter from the General Manager (usual Hilton stuff) saying how great that I had chosen Conrad and \"that they upgraded me to an Executive Floor Room\". But I was not upgraded and was given a standard room with views towards the office towers instead of the downtown. Not being upgraded is OK because it's not a given - but seriously, at least pay attention what you are writing in the welcome letters and if an upgrade is not possible than give a room with better views to your loyal customers. The room, was nothing special. Good (not great) size, very comfortable bed but awkwardly positioned - you could not watch TV from the bed as the TV was wall mounted on the right side of the bed.

The internet in the room is expensive, but then most hotels seem to charge for this these days. However you are given 1 hours Wifi connection in the lobby per day, included in the room rate, so it's not a big issue here. If you can get a deal as we did then a stay here is well worth it.

The price was quite high, but lucky for me, my company was paying for my stay, so the bill wasn't a concern. To others though, just remember Singapore is generally an expensive place to go to anyway, so I guess the hotel of this standard was about the right price. The location of the hotel is great. Surrounded by exceptional shopping malls and restaurants, you are never short of variety and things to do. It is also close to the MRT which makes it really easy to get around Singapore. The Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay Sands is about 15mins walk. For business travellers, as well as tourists, its right in the middle of everything. The rooms are neat and clean. I had a business room and it was bigger than other hotel rooms I've stayed in. A huge flat screen tv and a massive bed just makes you feel very comfortable. Especially with the complimentary chocolates and fruit on arrival. The outdoor pool is great for a dip. Its huge and was never busy. The fitness centre, although i never used it, looked very modern as well. I was lucky enough to get a free buffet breakfast every morning. There are two places you can have breakfast in. The restaurant on the ground floor is the bigger one and is available to everyone. It has a huge selection of food in the buffet and is definitely worth the visit, even with the crowds. The other restaurant is on the 4th level, only open to people staying on certain floors. It is a much more relaxing environment with much less people but the food selection is not as large. When you are deciding between the two, it just depends on what you are after. For the two weeks I was in Singapore, it was a pleasure staying at this hotel. It was my first trip to Singapore, so I don't know what other hotels in the area would have been like, but this was definitely one I will return to if I'm ever in the area again and would suggest you give it a try.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cGood but not great...\u201d", "Author": "jameskdean", "ReviewID": "UR91371085", "Content": "Overall the hotel is fine, but they get in the habit of adding club rooms on other floors in order to boost the prices.

A small box of complimentary chocolate was a delight. The bed was very funny - it looked more like a tall platform you have to climb up to. For a young person like me it is fun, but seems uncomfortable on the whole. No free internet is provided, which I think for such a place is a great drawback. The biggest problem was the bathroom. The bathtub leaked on the first day after using it. Though it was quickly fixed by hotel staff, I was left with an impression that everything in the bathroom breaks easily.

While the hotel itself is not new, i didnt get any of the dated feeling from the room. There was also little or no noise from the surrounding rooms. We were under a new year's deal that came with breakfast the next morning and dinner the night before. We mistakenly showed up at Oscar's for dinner, where they informed us that actually our dinner was at the chinese resataurant, Golden Peony, but because it was full they would be seating us at Oscar's instead and invited us to the buffet. The buffet was excellent - particularly if you like oysters (which we unfortunately do not eat), and the sheer spread was so inviting and enticing. For New Year's eve we were conscious that this would probably be about S$100 per head, so we were very pleasantly surprised that the hotel did not insist we go up to Golden Peony instead. We also squeezed in a visit to the gym - which was generally well equipped for a medium sized gym. Its also next to the pool, so easy access for people who want to run then swim. The gym is open to non-guests who are members, so during peak hours, there is a maximum time you are allowed on any of the cardio machines - around 20 or 30 minutes if i remember correctly. The hotel has also easy access to Marina Square and Millenia Walk - so shopping is readily availble.

I also had breakfast in the hotel at the restaurant \"Salon By The Pool\" and it was good with a large selection of food. The negative about this hotel is the internet. They charge 6 Singapore Dollars pr. 15 minutes and that will cost a business man a lot of money to do his work in this hotel. In my opinion internet should be free in every hotel, a lot of people actually select their hotels after where they can get free wireless internet access.

Also located near the expressway going to the airport and to sentosa. Room size was ok, Huge Sony bravia LCD TV. We got a room facing nearby pan pacific, we could see the singapore flier and thanks to the camera megazoom even the merlion. Bathroom was large - which is a big plus for me with separate shower stall, tub. Wife really liked the Acca Kappa bath soap and our toddler enjoyed the bath tub playing with the Conrad rubber duckie. Room also came with a complimentary small stuffed teddy bear. No free room internet though. Breakfast - nice setup but could have been better if the place were it was served was bigger. The food was good but fewer choices compared to other hotels of the same star rating that we have been. Staff was really friendly here. On seeing that we have a toddler with us, a high chair was at once offered and even brought us a kiddie placemat with kiddie (plastic with cartoon characters) and utensils.

When we arrived we were whisked away to the executive lounge and checked in there. The staff from the first minute were so polite and friendly and a real credit to the hotel. We were told that the executive lounge was still serving afternoon tea and we should go and get some refreshments before afternoon tea finished. Whilst we did this the staff finalised our room and get our luggage taken to our room. The room itself was perfect with a perfect view to match. The room had lots of little touches to make it that extra bit special. A great entertainment system, a pillow menu, a little box of chocolates, fruit etc. The bathroom was massive and had all the extras you expect. The location of the hotel is perfect as the MTR is right next to the hotel, this is easy to get to and from the airport on (which we did) and easy to get anywhere else in singapore too. The Suntec city mall accross the road has lots of shops and restaurants and is where the Hippo Duck tours pick up from. Overall we have been lucky enough to stay in some great hotels around the world and this is one of the best if not the best we have stayed in.

Hotel prices in Singapore are not cheap and even using the advanced payment option the rate was what we would usually consider to be very expensive (S$300 / night including breakfast and all taxes / service). However this is what you must pay to stay in this class of hotel when in Singapore. Those deciding to stay at the Conrad will not be disappointed as it is a very comfortable hotel. The rooms are of a good size and very nicely fitted out for both business and leisure traveller. The views from the windows were spctacular to say the least looking across towards the Merlion and Marina Bay. Looking to the side you had a great view of the Singapore Flyer and all the ships at anchor just off the coast. All the usual amenities were available including a 46\" Sony HD television and Home Theatre system. The bathroom was also of a good size and had separate shower and bath. Our only negative comments on the room was the bed is very high from the floor (about 32\") and the mattress was too firm for our comfort. The height must be a problem for some of the asian guests who can be quite short in stature. The room also appeared to be very clean however the skirtings in the corners were very dusty as was the carpet under the bed. Minor points but I would expect a hotel of this class to maintain a better standard of housekeeping. Breakfast was adequate buffet style with a fair choice of both asian and western food. All the food was nice and hot which is often not the case with buffet breakfasts. The restaurant is clean and the staff smiling and friendly. Best thing in this hotels favour is the location. It is in the heart of Marina Bay with hundreds of shops moments away. MRT is also nearby as is the terminus for the many city tour buses and the Singapore Flyer. Walking in the area is safe unless of course you stay here during the Singapore Grand Prix when some of the roads immediately outside the hotel are transformed into parts of the track. That's how close you are. All in all a very enjoyable stay however I think we will revert back to the Hilton in Orchard Road for our next visit.

Initially I was very prejudiced and searched negative in everything. But my stay where exceeded all my expectation. It is really luxury first class hotel. We lived in club room on the 26 floor with beautiful Marina bay view. Besides, from our room we saw Marina Mandarin Hotel, Pan Pacific hotel and Singapore Convention Centre. Hotel is very comfortable situated - near fountain of wealth - Suntec City. 2 MRT station - Esplanade and Promenade - 5 minutes walk. Transfer from airport to the hotel takes about 20 minutes and costs 17-20 sing dollars. When we entered to the hotel we were invited to the club floor for check-in. Check-in was very prompt. So far the staff did all formalities we were offered to drink champagne or wine. After that we were accompanied to our room. Room was spacious, comfortable and well equipped. The king size bed was very cosy. The bathroom had cabin and bath. There were even scales. Complimentary water and tea, coffee facilities. Unfortunately wi-fi internet was charged, but in club rooms you have 1 hour a day complimentary wi-fi. Lounge was very pleasant but there were too many people, although we always could find the vacant table. Beverage and alcoholic drinks are available for free during the whole day till 22-30. Breakfast, sweets and dishes during cocktail hours were really magnificent and very tasty. We lived in the hotel 4 days and we did not see the same dishes. Great array. I was very surprised. The swimming pool was on the fourth floor \u2013 was spacious enough. I was surprised again when we were brought a complimentary cool water and apples. And the smell in lobby was so charming \u2013 I did not want to leave from there.

I arrived at 5 PM and was quite disappointed when found out that they ran out of single rooms and thus I got a twin room instead. The only thing that made it better was the promise that the room would definitely have a good view and there were little glasses filled with refreshing juices served to us during check-in. It was the first time ever I got served with welcome drinks in any hotels in Singapore and trust me, I have been to many of them. What a nice little touch ! Then a staff took me up to my room and it was as promised, with the corner room, there were 2 windows and the small window on the side looks out directly at the Singapore Eye while the other one oversees the marina bay area. My first problem with the room happened when the door wouldn't be locked from the outside. Upon calling the reception, they fixed it within 10 minutes time while profusely appologizing for the problem. Later on when I was turning on the shower, the hot water shower knob fell off but fortunately I was able to put it back on since by this time I didn't want to wait for them to fix it up. Then as I was going to make tea, I found out that there were used and empty sugar and tea sachets in the bowl. So it was kinda bad impression that they didn't clean the room thoroughly. I was determined to write my review and give the hotel a 2 Star Rating due to these - until I experienced their level of service and hospitality ! All staff were always friendly and polite without seemingly pretentious. On the second night, I came home around 945 PM only to realized that I had forgotten to buy a medicine for my stomache. So I went to the Concierge and asked him the nearest drugstore. He led me out of the door and I thought he was going to show me the direction. But nooo, he actually crossed the street with me, entered the Millenia Shopping Mall right across the street and led me into an almost closing drug store. He then asked the cashier lady to keep the store opened and serve me because I was in need of a medicine. After making sure that I was fully attended, he smiled and left. I didn't get his name and never encountered him again for the rest of my stay, but it sure was one of the best service I have experienced in my life. The rest of my stay, I kept experiencing this extra-mile level of service throughout the hotel. When I asked the direction of the toilet, a staff didn't just show me the direction but actually led me down the stairs and into the front door of the ladies' room. In the meeting room, while waiting for coffee in the coffee machine, the staff asked me to wait inside and he then later brought my coffee in. Upon check-out, one of the concierge ladies even waited and chatted with me while waiting for a taxi. This hotel definitely brings a whole new meaning to service especially when service tends to be practical, efficient and in business-like manners in most singapore hotels. Their personal touch and sincere willingness to take a step ahead in guaranteeing the guest's experience is definitely an added value to the hotel. Although I am tempted to give them a 4-Star Rating, Ithe 3-Star Rating is due to the old-dated rooms, thin walls and also the fact that the TV is facing sideways to the bed which was a bit inconvenient since I like to watch the TV while falling asleep and having it on my side was kinda weird.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic - the nicest hotel I have every stayed in!\u201d", "Author": "scooby_d00_uk", "ReviewID": "UR62903264", "Content": "I don't know where to start with this place...

We queried this charge and, following discussion with the Front Desk Manager, our check-in assistant, Clint, informed us that the fee had been waived and that a bed would be delivered to our room free of charge! We were most grateful for the hotel's decision and it helped start our holiday off on a positive note. Our room was spotlessly cleaned every day by the housekeeping staff, with fresh fruit provided daily. We were also given a delicious cake to share on Christmas Eve. We received a turn-down service every evening, where slippers were placed on a clean mat on the floor next to our beds, classical music was left playing on the stereo system and bottles of spring water and clean glasses were placed on our bedside tables. Our spacious bathroom was always tidy, with towels, robes and toiletries replenished without asking. The pool was clean and rarely crowded, deep enough for serious lap-swimming as well as spacious enough to muck around in without disturing other guests. The complimentary chilled water and fruit provided by the pool staff was most welcome. The overground wallk from the Conrad to City Hall MRT station takes approximately 6mins whereas the underground walk takes approximately 12mins, however, it is an air-conditioned route which can be a welcome relief from the humidity. We also saw construction of a new MRT station diagonally opposite the hotel, which will make for an easier walk once the new line opens. For a cheaper alternative to airport taxis and shuttles there is a SMRT bus (number 153?) that travels via the Conrad to and from Changi Airport. Suntec City Mall, Millenia Walk, and Marina Square are within very easy walking distance and contain retail shops, supermarkets, fast food outlets and food courts (and a cinema in Marina Square). Also Makansutra at Glutton's Bay is a great introduction to traditional hawker-style food and a stroll along the Esplanade provides for an enjoyable after dinner activity.

Initially was quite impressed with the service, rooms, pool, staff etc. Bathroom is large and extremely clean. Hotel is tucked away but connected to numerous malls and near fountain of wealth with lots of eating options. Breakfast and dinner at 'Oscars' was exceptional. The hotel must have been full on the first 2 nights as we had to have breakfast in the Ballroom which was no where near as good as Oscars. They have a great selection, and Neil on the waffle station was superb. However after the 4th night maintenance works began on the same floor that we were all on. This consisted of painting doors with high strength oil paints/varnishes, and then removing wallpaper and re-wallpapering using glues and adhesives. The first night we had EXTREMELY strong fumes coming through the airconditioning in one of our rooms. Went to reception where we were offered to move rooms the FOLLOWING AFTERNOON. The next day we were offered a new room on the same floor, so we packed up and moved. There were ioniser machines up and down the corridor, and I thought this would be it. Not so, the works continued and each day there were at least 4 workmen with ladders and wallpaper EVERYwhere, vacuum cleaners all through the aisle, and the fumes - my goodness. I was so shocked and went and contacted reception - I just got a 'sorry for the inconvenience'. I couldn't believe that a 5 star hotel would carry out major maintenance works on the same floor where guests were staying. It wasn't just the inconvenience of having to walk through all the mess, but the strong fumes gave us all headaches/nausea/dry coughs etc etc. Couldn't believe the attitude of the staff when we checked out. They obviously didn't see it as a problem, and for this reason I will never stay at a Conrad or recommend this hotel to anyone. There are plenty of other hotels in the area that treat their guests better than this.

I had been lucky enough to see their January Sale prices for weekends at the Hotel throughout 2010 (paid in full in advance) and they were too good to pass up. I will plan my next visit to Singapore (and I'm sure there'll be one as I love that place!!) so as to take advantage of this sale again if I can. (I paid a TOTAL, ie. including all taxes, of SGD600 per room and one of the nights wasn't even classed as a weekend!!). As these were Business Rooms we also received SGD20 credit for laundry per room per day, and a guaranteed late checkout of 3pm. In fact, one of the rooms was extended to 5pm as our flight didn't leave for home until 9pm. GREAT value. Lots has been said about the comfort and amenities of the rooms and it's all true - great beds, great plasma screens with good channels, beautiful bathrooms, quality fittings, beautiful timber accents and sensational views. And breakfast (included in my price) was fabulous! One challenge is to negotiate the best route to the City Hall MRT - although the new Circle line will be open any day now and that will make getting around Singapore from the Conrad a lot easier. They had a \"soft\" opening of this line on one of our days in town and 50,000 people showed up to ride it for free between 11am and 4pm!! Nearby malls include Marina Square (find it via the Millenia Walk opposite the Hotel) and Suntec City. Raffles City is also close. Walking through the underground walkways/arcades makes all this a pleasant experience - over ground is quicker, but sweatier!! A couple of Food Courts are nearby - closest to the Conrad is \"Koufu\" (I think the spelling is correct) and we ate there a couple of times as it was soooo close and convenient and yummy!! Then there is the Food Loft at top of Marina Square (next best) and Food Republic at Suntec (third best as always sooo busy it's hard to find anywhere to sit down!!).

We arrived early in the morning after a red-eye and we headed straight to the hotel. Upon entering, our bags were taken from us and we were shown to reception. Initial impressions were good. A very understated lobby. The gentleman who checked us in was very polite and did not once mention that it is only 8am and the official check-in time is not for a while. He took took us to our room while making friendly small chat along the way. We were shown the facilities and he asked us if we needed anything else. The room - Generous size. Very clean (carpet still wet!). Bathroom - luxurious with amenities you'd expect from a 5 star hotel. TV & Radio - techy, maybe a little too techy.. not very user friendly. Bed & Pillow Menu - one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. Guaranteed a good nights sleep. Location - 10-15min walk from MRT. Across the road from Suntec. 2 negatives - 1) My partner spotted mould in the shower. Although it didn't bother me, it bothered her. She called up reception and they acknowledged this and said they would send someone up. Nothing happened. After 10 hours she called up again and explained what had happened. They apologized and said they would send someone up. Shortly after we heard a knock at the door. He simply looked at it and apologized and said it would be cleaned. It was never cleaned. Upon checkout we explained the situation again and they didn't seem phased by it. It's hard not to expect a lot better from Conrad. Although this did not trouble me, it might trouble the 'demanding business traveler' who would expect a discount, complimentary wine or dinner as an apology. 2) While service was impressive at check-in, it soon disappeared. The young lady who opened the door each time you enter and exit the hotel looked bored out of her skull and wouldn't break a smile or mutter a hello. Once again, not a huge issue, but for people who have high expectations - you might be disappointed. I am not entirely sure if I'd return to Conrad Singapore.

Both of us found that the hotel, while updated cosmetically and having a nice swimming pool, had sub-par service, poor cleanliness, and mediocre rooms. The service problems all centered on the desk personnel. Upon check-in I happened to notice that my colleague was being offered a \"business package\" that my clerk never mentioned. It turned out that this package ($20 in laundry/cleaning credit, plus breakfast, and a 3 PM checkout time, for one fee) was something that would work out well for me. I was glad to be able to get it, but slightly annoyed that my clerk didn't mention it while my colleague's clerk did. The rooms themselves, supposedly on a special \"business\" floor, were mediocre (see picture). Not much space, and no king size beds available despite having made our reservations 2+ months in advance. Worse, my colleague had problems with mildew or fungus in his room (again, see photo). He ended up switching to a new room for the second day, once space opened up. The service problems returned as we approached check-out. As I was packing around 2 PM, I got a knock on my door. It turned out to be a desk clerk, who asked, \"Excuse me sir, but we were wondering whether you were planning on checking out today?\" with an air of nervous expectation. I responded that I was planning on leaving by the 3 PM checkout time...was that not enough? He looked very confused and left. It turned out that there was no notation on my account about a 3 PM late checkout -- but there was the charge for the Business Package that included this privilege. My colleague experienced almost the reverse when finally checking out. In his case, nobody bothered him about leaving before 3 PM, but the $20 laundry credit had not been properly applied to his bill. The desk clerk was less than gracious (and less than competent) about dealing with it. So, overall, I was disappointed.

The location is on the quiter end of Marina Bay/Suntec, and a short walk to those malls; not quite as convenient as the Ritz or MO. Less than10 mins walk to City Hall MRT if you navigate there correctly, 20 mins if you dont. Taxis are usually a short 5-10min wait off-peak, even on weekdays, probably due to the slighly isolated location. A rather dark lobby contrasts with bright and airy corridoors on guest floors. The room felt a little cramped, but was a reasonable size (about 40sqm). The bed is ridiculously high (comfy but a little too firm) and the TV bolted to the wall and perpendicular to the bed, which is absurd since you cant really watch TV from the bed. A pity too since there's a massive HDTV and a dvd player for entertainment. Bathroom was spacious and had generic toiletries and decent pressure from the rather average showerhead. Decent view of the Bay but in general the views are of city buildings only. A few pieces of fruit everyday and the bear and rubber ducky are nice touches. There's an outdoor pool and a small gym which makes up for its size by being open 24 hours. Breakfast by the pool was average, small selection of hot and cold items, pretty standard and nothing outstanding. They apparently do eggs to order but you have to spot the little sign they place on one of the buffet tables to be aware of this as they dont publicise it. They also stipulate strict dress codes for breakfast but I spotted someone wearing shorts there anyhow so why have a policy if you are not going to enforce it. Having to dress up for breakfast is ridiculous but I believe this is only for the biz (and possibly exec) floor brekkie venues. A decent and comfy hotel, mostly catering to the business rather than leisure traveller, as it seems to lack warmth and personality. Great value though and not that different (unless you are a high maintenance type who enjoys being brown nosed etc) to the Ritz across the road which costs significantly more and isnt worth the premium IMHO.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "epsom , surrey", "Title": "\u201cYou will not beat this hotel for service\u201d", "Author": "pmhslh", "ReviewID": "UR57495015", "Content": "Returned to Conrad Singapore from 17th Feb to 21st feb with family,and on arrival got upgraded to the Presidential Suite ( room 2901 ) .

It was also nice of the reservation team to offer to upgrade us to the Executive floor after I made some feedback about the room rates, so kudos to that. Our classic twin-bedded room was on the 30th floor, offering views of Suntec City. The room at 40sm felt smaller than most as the bathroom occupied a sizeable portion of the room. Beddings and furniture were all very well maintained, although am not sure it was because we were on the Executive floor. Bathroom amenities were more than sufficient and the conrad bear was a quite signature touch for guests. The only thing is I didnt quite understand the layout of the TV as it was placed adjacent to the beds, which made watching TV quite tricky. The beds were terribly comfortable too! Requests for extra bottled water, towels, and ice buckets were met with quickly, and I had 2 pieces of laundry pressed as part of the perks of the Exe floor, which was returned very efficiently as well. We spent most of our time at the Executive Lounge as the aim of the trip was really to just relax and enjoy. I would recommend anyone to take the Executive floor rooms as the Lounge has complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea from 2:30pm - 5pm, then evening tapas from 5:30pm - 8pm. And its free flow of coffee, tea, soft drinks, wine, and sparkling wine, and housepours all day until 11pm. Basically you can have all your meals there if you want. Quality of food was also excellent given that it was offered complimentry. I had sandwiches, dim sum, chips, sweets, pralines, cheese platter etc and all were very good. They even have a nespresso machine for you to make your own coffee. In particular, Roy from the Executive Lounge represented the hotel magnificantly. Throughout my stays and travels, I have never ever experienced such a high level of service from any hotel. He was courteous, attentive without being intrusive, and indeed efficient. He made us feel totally welcomed at the lounge, despite the fact that we were probably one of the youngest group at the lounge. He went out of his way to ensure our needs were met, and always had a smile on his face even during busy periods. We observed that he delivered the same level of service to the other guests at the Lounge. The above, does also come with a slight comparison to a lady staff at the same Lounge during the stay unfortunately. We might have been mistaken as she may have been in a bad mood that day, but we encountered disdain in her eyes when we first entered the Lounge on 19 Feb, and throughout the afternoon she never served us at all nor smiled. At that time, the Lounge was slightly occupied with a few groups of non-locals, so we were the only local (and younger in age) group that afternoon. Regardless of what was the cause behind her attitude, it should not have happened, especially at the Lounge. And we caught her a few times slouching against the Lounge walls when not serving guests, which looked quite unsightly. But otherwise, the stay was most enjoyable. Good location for shopping as the hotel is right next to Suntec, Marina Square and Millenia Walk which offers multiple choices.

I thought it was a very nice gesture. Took breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails at the exec lounge - a good spread of all sorts of food. They have 4 different kinds of red wine and 4 whites to choose from, as well as champagne. Location is good, the nearby Millennia Walk is connected to Marina Square with hundreds of shops (but of course most were closed during the lunar new year period). Room was just normal size, bed was a bit too high and my first of two complaints was that while the bed faced the south with a most wonderful view of the city skyline and the Singapore River, the plasma TV was mounted on the right wall. So if we are in bed, we have to turn our heads to the right to watch the TV. Not exactly comfortable. The other complaint was that while the bathroom is of good size and amply endowed with good toilettries (Acca Kappa range), there isn't a socket for hair dryer!

Anyway shortly after 2 pm my room was ready and I was being upgraded to the Presidential Suite. From the moment I stepped into the Presidential Suite, everything was perfect right to the end when I was granted late check-out till 6 pm. Let me start by writing on their standard room (my standard room was on the Club Floor so can't comment on other standard room) as I was in there for about 2 hours before changing room. Their standard room is of good size, extremely well designed and totally printine, give you the feeling that the hotel was just built yesterday. The toilet is abit on the small side compared to Ritz Carlton (see my other review) but wonderfully stocked with lots of high quality amenities (Acca Kappa). The only thing I don't like about the whole room is the toilet cubicle, it is miniscule, literally (same for Ritz Carlton as well so I wonder is this the trend in Singapore hotels?). Other than that, their standard room is really value for money if you can get a good deal with the hotel. The Club Lounge is very well decorated with big plasma TV and comfortable chairs though the view is quite limited. The lounge serves daily breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails, with free flow of champagne till 11 pm when the lounge closes. The food is good but not marvellous and not many selections. The lounge is nice but the only glitch is it seems to be teeming with people at all times, especially worse during evening cocktail where you will have difficulty finding a place to sit. I cannot comment on the breakfast scene as I did not have breakfast there. You do not feel the exclusivity of a five star hotel Club Lounge when it is that busy. The service in the Club Lounge is great, but not as professional compared to that at Ritz-Carlton. Now the Presidential Suite. I have attached a few pictures of this Suite so it is mainly self-explanatory. As with the standard room I been to, the PS is very well maintained and very clean. It has got a bedroom (on the tiny side I would say), a living room, a dinning room, a pantry, a powder room, and sitting area with standard amenities of a PS such as cordless phone, fax machine and etc. I find the bed abit hard but this is a matter of personal preference. The one thing to emphasize is the dinning room. It has a unblocked view of the Marina, and it is a great enjoyment to have in-room dinning while overlooking the Marina. This hotel has a DVD library that you can loan DVD for your own viewing pleasure in your room, though I am not sure if this feature is also available to non-Club floor rooms. One thing worth highlighting is checking in and out at the Club Floor. Check-in was done on the Club Floor, where I find it strange that there is only one person and one table serving check-in guests. A few times I saw guests have to queue (standing as the check-in desk is just outside the elevator and there are no seats) for a while when checking in or out, and the same goes for me during check-out. Unlike checking out at Ritz-Carlton where you have the luxury of sititing in the Club Lounge enjoying drinks while they prepare the bills and bring it to you at your table. I checked out at 6 pm, and I was asked if I would like to continue my evening cocktails at their lounge, so I guess guests still have access to the lounge after check-out. Overall this is a great hotel if you are looking for an opulent hotel with good location without paying too much, and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone business or leisure travellers.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Espoo, Finland", "Title": "\u201cBe sure you get the city skyline view\u201d", "Author": "HraPormestari", "ReviewID": "UR56595535", "Content": "We stayed four nights in Conrad Centennial during our tour in Southeast Asia, and got to know that the hotel is pure luxury right from the start.

The hotel staff is proficient and friendly, and they really make you feel welcome. The concierge is always there for you, if you need some kind of assistance or advice. The pool at the hotel is wonderful, and the place to be, if you are too tired to leave out to the city. We had contacted the hotel in advance by e-mail and hoped for a high floor and a view to the city skyline, but weren't prepared for the fantastic room we got. Although it was just a classic guest room, it was HUGE - not to mention the beautiful view. One of the room walls was almost all window, and we could see everything all the way to Fullerton. From the smaller window on the adjacent wall we could see the Singapore Flyer. The bathroom was just as great as the room itself. There was a bath, a separate shower and comprehensive toiletries. The complimentary turndown service was a nice touch, since after a long day strolling around the city, the room is ready for going to bed. Locationwise Conrad copes a bit twofold. The enormous Suntec City Mall is right next to it, as are many other huge shopping centres. Also many of the city's great attractions are just a short walk away. On the other hand the walk to the MRT is longish, but luckily you get to walk most of the lenght indoors - come rainshower, you will want to get away from the streets, especially if you didn't remember to take umbrellas from your room with you. Considering the transport to the airport, the route to MRT is definitely too long to walk with luggage.

We did consider the St. Regis, but since my wife is pregnant I wanted to limit the walking to shopping where possible. Since I\u2019ve stayed at Orchard Road a few times, I wanted to try out a new spot. Based on reviews and location, we chose the Conrad. BOOKING: I booked online through the Hilton Honors site also requested a car at the airport to pick us up. A reply from the hotel confirming the hotel transfer and rate was received within an hour of booking online. CHECK-IN/CHECK-OUT: As a Hilton gold member, we were upgraded to the executive floor. When we arrived they took us and our luggage straight to our room and filled in all the particulars there. Check-out was done at the desk on the executive floor and was very quick. LOCATION: The Conrad is located right in the heart of Suntec City overlooking the fountain of wealth. Access to Suntec City Mall, Marina Square & Millenia Walk in right at your doorstep, so to speak. Further afield you can walk all the way to Raffles city via Marina square & the underground Raffles link. It\u2019s roughly a 20 minute drive to the airport and a 15 minute drive to Orchard road. COMMON AREAS: The hotel has a very \u201cgrand\u201d feel to it. The Christmas tree made of little teddy bears was certainly impressive. As for other amenities, we hardly spent much time in the hotel to check them out. FOOD: Our first morning we had breakfast on the executive floor; the food and selection was decent and the service was impeccable. However it has a very pretentious feel to it and feels like eating in a library. For people who want a peaceful undisturbed breakfast, I would recommend it. The other mornings we decided to eat breakfast at the main restaurant as we\u2019re a bit livelier. The selection in the main restaurant is incredible. I\u2019ve seen plenty of places that have a waffle station in their buffet, but the Conrad is the first to have around 8 flavours of ice cream to go with them! Outside of breakfast we never ate at the hotel so can\u2019t comment on the other restaurants. ROOMS: The room we had was very nice and had a cozy yet modern feel to it. The bed was very tall & extremely comfy. We had a very nice view of the fountain of wealth. They had Acca Kappa toiletries in the bathroom for people who care about those things, (i.e. my wife). It may sound silly but I was also impressed by how many hangers they had in the wardrobe. It wasn\u2019t the standard 4 or 5 hangers but a whole wardrobe full. Something that wouldn\u2019t be lost on a business traveler. SERVICE: Service was great. Everyone we dealt with was an above average employee. Especially of note was the driver who picked us from the airport, and the concierge/valets at the front door. Whenever we asked a specific question, they always added their own opinions/recommendations which turned out to be great. Also, whenever we requested a taxi they were very thorough in making sure the cab driver knew where we wanted to go exactly. VALUE: We actually got a reasonable weekend deal through their website and for the quality of stay I certainly would have paid much much more. OVERALL: This is a great place and I don\u2019t think you could go wrong by staying here. It definitely competes with the Shang in terms of service, and will be a place we consider when we make our next trip to Singapore.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant hotel with impeccable service!\u201d", "Author": "NB70", "ReviewID": "UR52946304", "Content": "My partner and I just got back from our two-night stay at the Conrad Centennial Singapore.

The Conrad\u2019s location is ideal since it is directly next to the highway to the airport and is a mere 20 mins drive away. Arriving I arrived by taxi. Luggage collected by bell boy. Check-in was speedy. I only booked a standard room and was delighted to hear that I have been upgraded to a suite due to my Hilton Honors status. The check-in lady escorted me personally to my suite. The room The room I got was on the 8th floor directly overlooking the Suntec City water fountain. The hotel called it a Centennial suite which presumably is their one-bedroom suite. There\u2019s a separate sitting area but no guest bathroom and no walk-in closet. In fact, it feels rather cramp, and not helped by the hotel\u2019s choice of bulky furniture. The bedroom is just as cramp, with the large king size bed occupying most of the space. The bed is very comfortable with fine linens and there\u2019s also a pillow menu. I wonder if the normal room might actually be better since I can do without the living room and all the extra furniture that takes up lots of space in the suite. The bathroom on the contrary was quite spacious with dual vanity sinks, a shower cubicle and a large bathtub. Unfortunately, the hotel was showing it\u2019s age as per the rather old bathroom fittings. The shower cubicle in particular was annoying with only a small shower head and low water pressure. And a pet peeve of mine, no shower stick! The toiletries are Acca Kappa, quite nice. Also, the bathroom had mold and some wear and tear, though not obviously unsightly. There is a large 46\u201d LCD TV in the living room and a sound system (Sony). Unfortunately, the TV isn\u2019t positioned correctly, so you have to watch it by \u201clifting your head up\u201d. The is a smaller TV tucked away in the bedroom. Internet connection is not free, S$30 a day. Strangely, there is no wireless internet in the hotel. The Conrad offers very generous welcome amenity for the price paid, including a full basket of fresh fruits ( 6 varieties ) and a box of fine chocolates. There\u2019s also a free Conrad toy bear. The suite is a corner room and the hotel appears to have good sound insulation. I have no problems with noise whatsoever except for the slight traffic noise from the streets. Common Areas In contrast to the room, the common areas are sweeping, spacious and grand conveying good sense of luxury. A eye-catching chandelier anchors the main lobby. The buffet restaurant Oscars appears to be quite popular. Food quality is quite good, though not really outstanding. The gym is next to the pool and has modern gym equipment. The pool doesn\u2019t look very big. The hotel is right next to the Millenia Walk shopping mall and also walking distance to the Suntec city that have more shopping malls and eating outlets. Service Service is quite good and all staff are very polite and helpful. I can\u2019t comment more since I have a very short stay at the hotel ( checked late afternoon and left early morning ) so didn\u2019t really make use of more of their service. Conclusion Overall, this is a nice mid-range 5-star hotel. What I really do not like is the bathroom. It\u2019s in need of a full scale renovation. I\u2019m not sure if other rooms have better bathroom but if a suite bathroom is as such, can\u2019t expect more from the standard rooms. The Conrad is not top-notch luxury and is also priced accordingly. If you are not fussy with bathroom, this is quite a nice hotel to stay in and certainly good value and very decent.

The room had a good iron and ironing board, which - being a big fan of linen - I always appreciate. As others have said, there is no wireless internet in the rooms and broadband access is expensive - if i had been there for work that would really make me mad. That would be the only gripe I had .

Very modern, not an old hotel which has been refurbished like a lot of others in Singapore. Great location (next to the convention centre, and very close to the Singapore Flyer), and importantly its away from the noisy bars and jaded and well worn tourist area of Clark Quay (but still close enough to be only a short $5 taxi ride away if you do want to go there, which I would recommend doing at least once if you haven't seen Clark Quay before). From the concierge staff to the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff to the restaurant staff to the business lounge staff, I just cannot fault. The concierge staff were so very attentive and helpful in arranging day tours. The front desk staff upon checkin, personally escorted us to our room and explained everything we wanted to know along the way. It was lovely to relax by the not crowded and large swimming pool in the Singaporean afternoon heat, and be able to order meals and drinks from the poolside bar and have these served to you whilst lounging by the pool. So very relaxing ....... We travelled as a family of two adults and two children, and whilst I get the impression that this hotel is not the first choice for families (probably due to its price), the hotel was still very accommodating for the children. The only complaint I would make (if I had to make one) would be the speed of service in the lobby restaurant (Oscar's) during even the non busy times. Whilst the food was lovely, it was just too slow. For instance, we were booked in to do an evening tour and had one hour to have dinner prior to going out on the tour. We sat down and ordered. Forty minutes into the hour, the food had still not arrived (and this as before the dinner rush had even begun). After some reminders to the wait staff, the food did arrive with fifteen minutes to spare. So we quickly ate the food, so what was to have been a leisurely and relaxing dinner, turned into a worrying half hour or so as to why the food hadn't arrived yet, followed by a quickly eaten dinner in about 10-15 minutes, which was somewhat annoying (and which with young kids is often difficult to have them eat so quickly). But as everything else about the hotel was just so good, this one thing didn't sour our opinion of the property even in the slightest.

You'll find a dedicated staff sooo perfect, elegant, smily and helpful always ready to make of your experience in this hotel a memorable one. Apart of a personnalized check in and check out, you'll have a yummy complimentary breakfast in the peaceful atmosphere of the lounge; an afternoon tea with an extended choice of delicious sandwiches and cakes; the popular \"Evening cocktails and canap\u00e9s\" with free flow of champagne if you're a fan and different dishes all delicious. Actually, it's more a little dinner than a cocktail time and it's until 8pm which is very convenient. Moreover, at any time you want, you'll be always welcome for a complimentary soft drink or tea/coffee and there is free wifi in the lounge as well...

Lounge service varied between excellent - taking time out to explain the different ingredients of each dish - and ignored. Sat for 30 minutes one evening without being asked if I wanted anything. Also, one time the lounge was too full and I was asked to sit in a conference room where two businessmen were having a meeting - awkward for all of us I think. Finally, location is good, near the esplanade and the flyer, and a huge carrefour across the road for any bits and pieces, but is a bit of a walk to the MRT after a long day until they open the new station right nearby.

The rooms are quite spacious and come with every amenity you could hope for. The rubber duck and teddy bear is a nice touch.

Booked the room thru expedia for $111 US a night which included breakfast buffet every morning for the two of us. Arrived half an hour before check in time of 2pm and was told not a problem to check in then. The only hick up the entire stay was they did not show me as having breakfast included on their reservation. Showed a copy of my expedia receipt and it was handled on the spot. I requested a non-smoking king size standard room, but they were booked for non-smoking. They offered a non-smoking two double bed room or a smoking king size room. I asked to see the smoking room/smoking floor. Could barely tell it was a smoking floor/room so opted for the king size room. The rooms are large, beds are comfortable and the shower/bath is great. No problems with water pressure at all. Housekeeping was great and always there when i needed something. Mention was made in other reviews that the TV was on the wall and to the side. This is true but it posed no problem for us. Breakfast buffet included at Oscar's every morning. It was great and really made the stay! we would sleep in and hit the buffet around 0945 and it was loaded with fruits, vegetables, cheeses, main dishe. Very good brunch! This saved us quite a bit as we would eat here before going out and then getting a snack to tide us over to supper. Pool area was nice. The only thing we would say is that you should take a taxi if going to the MRT. Other reviews mention it being a 10 min walk. It was closer to 15. It is a bit confusing and requires you to walk thru a maze of malls and underground shopping venues to find. We stayed 5 days here by the second day of walking everywhere we were tired. Taxis are cheap and readily available at the hotel entrance. Taxi to the airport from the hotel is less than 15$ Sing and less tham $30 Sing after midnight due to a 50% surcharge after 12am.

Of course, keep the room until 6pm and then use the executive lounge for as long as you like :can we book a 'larger' taxi for 4 plus luggage at a cheaper rate than the hotel transport? Of course, we will also advance some currency against your room expenses so that you can pay the driver (worked out a lot cheaper than changing a travellers cheque). We really enjoyed our stay and the attentiveness of the staff made us relax right up to the end of our holiday - it was lovely to be able to shower in comfort after a long day of sightseeing & shopping then to relax in the exec lounge with a glass (or two) of champagne and some very substantial snacks until it was time to make our way to the airport - very civilised! I have to say that the exec lounge is fabulous. The standard of food/drinks is excellent, the views are superb and the staff are some of the best I have come across.

After having stayed at the Grand Hyatt, Mandarin Oriental, Meritus Mandarin and the Swissotel on numerous occasions, I have found my ideal hotel in Singapore. This is mainly to do with its spacious rooms, which, even in the \"Classic\" (i.e. standard) category, are so comfortable, decorated in very restful earthy tones/colours, and boasting the most comfortable beds anywhere, covered in the smoothest and silkiest bed linen, such that I looked forward to going to bed every night. A 42\" Sony Bravia LCD TV and DVD player provide ample entertainment. Some glitches, which I brought to the hotel's management via the questionnaire: 1. Inconsistent Housekeeping: envelopes not replenished daily, even after I called on 2 consecutive days to remind the Housekeeping department; on some days, the decorative bolster and throw were placed on the bed, but not on other days; only 1 bottle of water provided for a double room, necessitating calls to Housekeeping. 2. Check-out took more than half an hour, due to disputes over various charges, and the receptionist confessed that the system is very slow. In the end, all the disputed charges were rebated, but to take more than 30 minutes to check out is unacceptable. Fortunately, I was not running late for a flight! Lovely touches in the hotel include: - Scented candles in the lobby; - Well-equipped gymnasium, with freshly-squeezed orange and guava juices on tap; - Stereo tuned to classical music radio station by evening turn-down staff; - Spacious, well-lit marble bathrooms I stayed on a \"2 for 1\" promotion, which made for excellent value, as the Conrad is otherwise an expensive business hotel (I was on vacation). On the Business Floor (one category below the Executive Floor), the rate includes breakfast at the \"Salon by the Pool\", whose buffet, while not as extensive as that of Oscar's (the main restaurant); is more than adequate. The staff are obliging, to the extent of fetching grapefruit and Milo for me from Oscar's, as it was not part of the Salon buffet. Other Biz Flr benefits include a daily $20 laundry allowance, which I negotiated to be substituted for Internet access (very pricey at S$30 per day). Rooms face either Suntec City (4 large office towers surrounding what is billed as the world's largest fountain), or the more picturesque harbour. In spite of my extended stay, my repeated requests for a harbour-view room were in vain, on the grounds of high occupancy. The Conrad is situated above Millenia Walk, a mixed-use retail and office complex, which is linked to the Suntec City and Marina Square malls. The very fast, clean, cheap and convenient underground train system, the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) is a 10-minute walk away, under the Marina Square complex. Inside Suntec City, there's a huge Carrefour supermarket, where one can stock up on provisions which would otherwise cost an arm, leg and even a spleen at the hotel. SIngapore's largest church, New Creation, operates 4 services every Sunday at its premises in Suntec City, which I happily attended. While the Conrad is clearly targeted at a corporate market, I felt very welcome and comfortable as a leisure traveller, and made full use of the pool and gym.

We were able to benefit from the promotional 50% off sale so I will try to gear my review as if there were no promotion and we were paying full price like we did at our previous stay at the Shangri-La Singapore. Both are 5 star hotels so they \"should\" be pretty equivalent. When we arrived, the hotel staff warmly greeted us. Very nice staff overall I must say. Check in was quick and no problems whatsoever. With our accomodations, we had the breakfast buffet included in our rate. We had the optoin to eat at the executive lounge or at Oscars. We decided to go to Oscars since they had more options than the lounge. Oscars had the usual spread of breads, international foods, omelette station, waffle station, and drink area. For a five star hotel though, I felt like the food was just average. The cereals and dried fruit had a stale taste, soy milk wasn't readily available, the omelette station had a hard time making well done scrambled eggs, breads didn't seem fresh as well as some of the other food options. The freshly made waffles were good with the ice cream option but the glazed pecans and almonds you could top them with were stale. The drink options were okay as well since they would make a fresh carrot juice or semi-fruit smoothie if asked. In terms of everything else, the napkins were hard as a rock. Don't expect to be able to use them without scratching your face off or your childs. Not sure why you would starch them so much that they are only good to look at on the table. Oscars staff was very nice and helpful, but even there professionalism and warmth wouldn't justify me paying around $42 SGD for this buffet. And that's the main point, the buffet is okay especially if it's free, but not if you have to pay that amount of money for it out of your pocket. I could be a bit biased though because I did just stay at the five star Shangri-la Singapore where both breakfast buffet options at the hotel were out of this world good with more options available and everything being fresh. Our executive room was nice. It had a nice layout that made the room seem larger than it was. We also had a great view. The beds were excellent and comfortable. The staff again was great in providing fresh fruits everyday and a turn-down service. A nice touch. Our bathroom was very nice. I would have to say that it was a lot better than the Shangri-La's bathroom. Had a nice layout and great toiletries. The flat screen tvs were huge and of a higher standard. I have never seen a flat screen like this in a hotel before. They also had dvds to check out or movies to order if you wanted to watch something. There wasn't an iron or ironing board available in the room. Not a big deal, but made you wonder since it is a five star hotel. Power outlets were very minimal in the room. Wife had a hard time finding a place to using her curling iron. The staff was nice enough to provide a converter for us though. Internet was available to use by either purchasing it for our room ($30SGD a night - expensive!!), going to the executive lounge (no shorts or comfortable attire allowed and closed at 11pm), or go to the first floor busy lobby and camp out there as long as you want. Not the best options in my opinion. Some other options to be noted at the Conrad: - Pool was a nice size. - Gymnasium was very nice. You definitely would be able to keep up your workout plan away from home w/the nice collection of free weights and machines. - Location was very central to everything. This can be a plus and a minus. When we were there, an event was going on where a man was making announcements over a loud speaker for a long period of time. It was a bit irriating and we were on the 28th floor. This was near the Fountain of Wealth so who knows what was going on. - The one staff negative is that the executive and front desk phone service were not great at all. I had tried to call them both numerous times during out trip and only was able to reach them once. Otherwise, I had to physically go downstairs for assistance. Not sure why they have these services available if I can never reach either of them. All in all a great deal for the promotional rate we received with 50% off.

I asked to be moved and all he could do is tell me \"this is 'unfortunate'.\" He did offer to let me use the bath in another room and return to my room when finished... Yes, great compromise for a 5 star hotel. The pool area is adequate, yet there is no jacuzzi or anything else to really recommend it. The arrendants were very helpful, though, bringing fruits and towels. All in all, by about 25 minutes after attempting to check in, we were disillusioned with this place and things only got worse. However, we got this on the \"u bid it\" type site and paid less than a third of the going rate. If you're willing to risk less than great accommodations and service, I'd recommend using that service and maybe you'll get your money's worth. If I had it to do over, I'd pay a lot more and opt for any other place, though. Some bright points... the lady in the gift shop was wonderful and wrapped my gifts with utmost care. Also, free DVD's on loan from the gift shop with a decent selection for all ages. The concierge was helpful, too. DO try his recommendation for good Mexican food over at Riverside Point at a place called the Iguana Cafe. Get the mini chimichangas for the appetizer! Also, this is a 5 minute walk across to the Carrefour supermarket so whatever you may need for your trip is within easy reach. There is a good Japanese restaurant out the back door, too. Coffee places and and a live music beer bar is also within about 30 second's walk so you can always find food and drink close-by in addition to good shopping. The Hippo sightseeing bus has it's main stop just across the street and runs about every 20 minutes or so and is very reasonable in cost. I'd recommend taking the red circuit before doing anything else as it just takes about 40 minutes and takes you all over. Then you can decide what you want to do later on. The yellow circuit is good, too, going out further into the outskirts of the city. DO get off at Clark Quay at night time and have a walk around. It's a beautiful area! You can catch the Hippo boat tour near that stop. Singapore's a nice place to visit... just wish the hotel hadn't been so disappointing.", "Date": "June 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLet down by Club and over the top charges\u201d", "Author": "The_Hotel_Reviewer", "ReviewID": "UR33286722", "Content": "This was my first experience with the Conrad Centennial Singapore and unfortunately it hadn't been as good as I had hoped. I stayed in Rm 2619 (King Executive) for two nights (approx SGD$280 per night - on a deep discount), which included access to the Executive Floor Lounge. Rooms are nice, with good bathrooms (including a usable bath) and great tolietries (Anna Kappa - Italian origin). TV is poorly placed to side of bed, but otherwise all is good. The room climate control, however, worked poorly - my room was sweltering when I arrived (room is the power saving sort where card needed to power the A/C at anything other than minimal - not a good arrangement in a tropical climate) and I could only make it comfortable by turning the dial down past 10 degrees (which got the room to about 19 degrees as long as you stayed in your room). Executive Club was a let down - only the couches (of which there where only a couple) where comfortable, all the other chairs did not encourage you to linger. Staff in the lounge pretty much left you to yourself - especially if you weren't a local - which was annoying since if you wanted a drink (other than the limited wine or juices out) you had to get one of them to give it to you. Only a small selection of canapes and low grade nibbles put out. You can go down to Oscar's for the included breakfast if you want, which I recommend, as there is greater choice and better service. Lounge also wasn't very large, would get very crowded when hotel isn't half-empty (like it was when I was there). From my experience the lounge was well below par for a five star asian hotel. Got a huge shock when a friend and I ordered coffee in the Lobby Lounge one afternoon, not only was the concept of a flat white not understood but the charge for two very bad coffees was SGD$24. Outrageous. In short, I felt this hotel fell short of the standard to be expected of a premier five star hotel in Asia, especially when it came to service.

Staff re fluff the cushions on couches every time guests vacate it. The concierges are constantly engaging guests with friendly conversations and smiles. A great lobby to settle back in. Check-in was very quick and friendly despite the long queue (must have been some corporate group checking in from Japan at the time). Most staff were all smiles except for the rare few that stood around with a glimpse of attitude. One bell boy accepted my 'good morning' with a quick nod. It's usually the other way around in most 5 star properties - bell boys greet me and i nod them with a smile. Rooms are very good but not superb. You need to take a few steps back to do a high jump onto your bed cos they're so high. Try not to fall off the bed while sleeping - you WILL injure yourself. Not exactly my type of bed, but soft and plush nonetheless once you are settled in. Nice flat TV screen on the wall but it's positioned in such a way that you have you look sideways from your bed to watch TV - awkward. A good list of channels to choose from though. Room maintenance is well done and I had a nice view of the wealth fountain & the Suntec from my room. Cute fruit platter was much appreciated and so was the yellow duckling!! Little touches as these make a world of difference and truly make you feel welcome. Bathroom is big with nice marble walls and a separate shower - bath. Plenty amenities (with generous portions - as is the case with all Conrads). My only problem with it was that the shower was not barriered off in any way that if you took a shower you'd wet the entire bathroom floor. An unfortunate flaw in an otherwise excellent bathroom. The bathroom mirrors are also not heated - take a long hot shower and they become useless. Do not get me wrong - the hotel (incl. the rooms) is an excellent one. Those bits that I'm picking on are those I'd change to have it rival the other giants and be at the top of the league. One last thing I'd change (and this is purely subjective) are the candles in the lobby. Given its status as a business hotel, it would be better to scent the lobby with a smell that is more 'soothing' than that which is 'stimulating'. Most guests walking in the doors at night are tired from work and would certainly appreciate a scent that can calm their nerves. Didn't get to use the swimming pool so cannot comment. As for location, it's great to shop and sight-see. It's a stone throw away from the Esplanade Theater, Suntec, Millenia Walk, Marina Bay etc (all shopping malls). But it's a good 20 minute walk away from the nearest MRT station (Cityhall). Once again, a great location but not a superb one. Overall, a lovely hotel indeed... in fact, so lovely that it makes you cringe to iron out those few areas of flaws to make it perfect. I am ready to transfer my loyalty from SPG to HHonours if this is to happen.

But frontline and reservation needs improvement.\u201d", "Author": "AnYanXuan", "ReviewID": "UR24645537", "Content": "I had booked a month in advance for a 1 night stay in a king bed business room at the Conrad on valentines\u2019 day. However, 2 days before the 14th, a staff from Conrad called to inform me that they would be running on full house on 14 feb, and hence are offering an early check in at 10 am. As I had plans for the morning, I declined the offer and informed them that I would be checking in at the official check-in time of 2pm. The staff went on to inform me that, as they would be expecting a large crowd, it would be advisable for me to arrive after 3pm to avoid the crowd at check-in. On the 14 feb, I arrived at 215 pm at the hotel lobby but only managed to get my turn to check-in at 240pm. I had a bad feeling when the front desk staff processing my check-in started making calls to the housekeeping department exclaiming the lack of rooms to issue to the guests checking in. True enough, she then informed me that the room category I had booked for was not available, and there were only twin beds left for the business rooms. She then proceeded to issue me a king non-executive room, which according her was the only room with a king bed left. When I enquired on why I could not get a room that I had reserved for, She simply answered that \u201crooms are issued on a first-come-first-served\u201d basis. Imagine what rooms would be left if I had really came at 3pm? She went on further to explain that all the rooms in the different categories are exactly the same, differing only in the benefits that came with the room. Throughout the whole incident, she was persistent in getting me to accept the \u201cdowngrade\u201d and her take-it or leave-it attitude showed that she was unwilling to go think of any other alternative. Only after further enquiry, did she mention that my room would only be available at 7pm after a group of tourist on the business levels who has paid for late checkout till 6pm leaves. I am seriously puzzled on why the hotel actually allowed the prior group of guests to extend their checkout when they are expecting a full house? That was not all. Minutes after entering the non-executive room that I was issued, I was rudely interrupted by a housekeeping staff who entered my room with her \u2018staff key\u2019, without even ringing the doorbell! Her explanation for intruding was, she was trying to check if the room is currently being occupied as the front desk is facing a shortage in available rooms. My partner and I were appalled at the way our privacy was not respected and also at the lack of communication between the front desk and housekeeping department. Being our first stay with Conrad, I was seriously disappointed at the level of service we were provided with. I had read numerous good reviews regarding the hotel and was looking forward to my stay. I only managed to get the room category that I had booked for, at 7pm, after the senior duty manager personally attended to my request. The rooms at the Conrad did live up to their reputation in terms of cleanliness and comfort. Small details such as the pillow menu were also thoughtful. The room service was also prompt and delicious. My only piece of advice for those that are staying at Conrad during peak occasions.

It may be more expensive than other hotels in the area, but with the rate that we were able to get, it was much cheaper than a hotel in Europe. The beds were very comfortable and the little touches like the fresh fruit in the rooms were appreciated. One minor complaint: the fancy bedside panel with which the room controls the lights was not working well. In our first room (We started and finished our Asian vacation at this hotel), the switch for the desk lights needed pounding in order to turn it on and off. In our second room, even though we turned the privacy light off in our room, it didn't turn off at the door and we came back from a long day of museums and shopping to find that the room had not been made up. Simple switches do have some value! The staff were friendly and perform beautifully. They sometimes even cross the line into being too helpful and too intrusive. As usual, I am constantly irritated by how much these high end hotels charge for things like breakfast, drinks and extras. If I could find a chain that gave some luxury but also charged reasonable prices, then I would be a loyal customer. If breakfast isn't included in your rate, then I would skip the hotel breakfast and instead walk the 10 meters into the nearby Millennium Walk and catch breakfast in the mall.

We loved the food there and we loved Conrad. I called Conrad directly to book because the Hilton website cannot handle an option with 2 adults and 1 child. The check-in process was smooth and we got what we asked for, non-smokiing room, a king-size bed with a rollaway. We are Hilton Honors Gold member and we were upgraded to a business class room with complementary breakfast. The room on 17th floor was spacious with big windows and we could see the harbor and a few other high-rise hotels. It was fun to just looking out the window. We were offered to have breakfast on the executive floor or cafe on the first floor. We picked the cafe on the first floor because we were told that the selection was more there. The breakfast offered Japanese, Chinese and American food. It was quite decent considered it was free.We paid around US$235 per night including tax and service charge. This is a very good price for 5-star quality and service. The concierge, laundry valet, pool/gym area offered very attentive and speedy service. Business class included $20 credit for laundry and I took advantage of it and had our jeans washed for free. I am a cost conscious traveler. It is defintely a luxury to me. Conrad is across the street from Suntec City which is a huge shopping mall with a lot of nice restaurants and food courts. You could find cuisine ranging from Chinese, Sudanese, Indian and more there. McDonald's, Burger King could also be found near the food court if your kids miss their comfort food. I broke down and let my kid have a hamburger after traveling in Asia for more than 10 days. If you want to play tourist, there is also a tourist center where you can take the Hippon (Hop on and hop off) Tour bus to see the city. It is also the depot of the amphibian duck tour. The country/city is quite small and taking taxi is the way to go. It is very inexpensive. We went to Long Beach Seafood restaurant on East Coast for dinner the first night. It is on the beach. Their famous black-peppered Sri Lanka crab was definitely a must to have if you go to Singapore. It was spicy but not overpowering. I could still taste the sweetness and freshness of the crab. My son had a buttered crab. It was also very good. We went to Newton circus (sp?) the seond night for chili crab. This was a place full of hawker stands. The Conrad conciege told us about the rating the hawker stands have. Pick the one that is A rated. This is an interesting experience that you should not miss. We took a subway there ourselves after a day visit to Sentosa, an island that offered, cycling, underworld aquarium, luge ride, cablecar ride and fish spa. Yes, we paid to have fish eating dead skin off our feet. It was a very fascinating experience. Conrad is quite far from the subway station. Both Conrad and Suntec City offer shuttle bus to take you to the closest MRTstation. The hotel is not within distance to Orchard Road that was the haven for shopping. I don't like shopping while I am traveling. So I didn't miss the shopping too much. We loved our time in SIngapore and Conrad was an excellent choice.

I asked for pressing of two trousers and two shirts, and they were quickly picked up and agreed for an 8am return.

Everything was returned, punctually, without further editorial comment, at 8am the next morning, in time for me to head to the day\u2019s business. (The frayed cuff was dutifully pressed as well.) Conrad impressed me when my meeting schedule started running long. I had meetings both in the CBD and at Suntec.

This caused me a lot of confusion and stress as I had to keep calling down to the lobby to see if any messages had come for me.

Our room was a corner room (non-suite) and it had a little window on the side wall that was not all windows. The rooms are spacious and classy. The pictures on the Conrad site make them look dated and do not do them justice. There is a flatscreen TV with a dvd/radio sound system that is excellent.

The toiletries are Molton Brown and they give you a ton of everything, and the bathroom is huge. It must take up half of the total area in the room. This floor is where the executive lounge is and it is great with a wonderful staff. Food in the lounge is good and there are computers with free internet. This is truly a business hotel, but we were here on holiday and we did not feel as if we were out of place. The breakfast buffet at Oscar\u2019s is really good too. There are staff people everywhere. The buffet has a nice balance of western breakfast items and Asian breakfast items and my favorite, dim sum. The pool area is nice and the gym/spa has a yogilates (yoga/pilates) class out by the pool on Tuesday mornings free for hotel guests, which was a nice way to start the day even in the morning humidity. As for the location of the Conrad, if you want to be close to an MRT stop, then it is about a 15+ minute walk. You can walk almost completely through several shopping malls all the way to City Hall station. If you walked outside, it would probably take less than 15 minutes to walk it. If you want to be near shopping that is not Orchard Rd, this is the place for you. It is across from Suntec, Millenia Walk, and Marina Square. But in Singapore, no matter where you are, there are at least 3 shopping malls in close proximity. There are restaurants across at Millenia Walk and in the other shopping malls. Across the street at Suntec there is a nice indoor food court there. Since we were scheduled to arrive around 1:45am, we splurged and booked the hotel limo, but worth it for us because we had never been to Singapore before and our driver was waiting for us right after baggage claim. After coming from LAX via Tokyo on a 2 hour-delayed flight, we were exhausted and it was nice to be taken care of at 4:00am. All in all, we loved this hotel. We stayed at The Oriental after a side trip to Phuket, and we like the Conrad better. It might help that we are Hilton Diamond members, but there just seemed to be a better vibe for us at the Conrad.

It all started with the great service through the hotel reservations department. Since we were travelling with my 2yo daughter, took the option of spending a little bit more and booked the Centennial Suite. As this is in the business floor area, were whisked to the Executive floor for check in. The room was excellent giving us a separate area for our 2yo (with a cot pre-arranged at no extra charge) while we watched TV on a huge plasma (another plasma is included in the bedroom). A small teddy bear was provided also for our daughter, as well as a little amenities pack which was a nice touch. The hotel staff are very friendly and pleasant and the concierge most knowledgable. Staff treated our daughter like a celebrity almost to the point that we were like her entourage!! Surprised at other comments in respect to this hotel, and almost changed our booking because of it - so glad we didn't. The hotel is clean, well maintained, and provides all of the touches expected of an international hotel. The pool was clean and a decent size. Breakfast was included and caters for all tastes with a good selection. We had dinner at Oscars one night and this also was good value for money in comparision to typical hotel meals/expenses. We found the location well suited for our needs with many shopping areas near-by. Would recommend going to the Carrefour grocery store across from the hotel for snacks, drinks etc (very convenient with the little one requiring milk etc). If you don't mind the heat (or its not raining) would recommend walking to the City Hall MRT as it was less than 5mins (compared to at least 10 underground) and no escalators (at least 5 which is tricky with a stroller). In all, the choice of the suite was a wise choice if you can afford a bit extra, especially if travelling with little ones. This hotel needs to be elevated in rank for Singapore hotels - highly recommended.", "Date": "April 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong", "Title": "\u201cJust a little bit ahead of the pack\u201d", "Author": "beijau", "ReviewID": "UR7414751", "Content": "This was my second stay at the Conrad in the past eight years.

In my opinion, the Ritz Carlton offers a better quality of stay with a similar location, so go there if money is not an issue. The Four Seasons is a long way away, but also ranks higher in my book for comfort and service. Compared to several other Singapore hotels I have stayed at, though, the Conrad is clearly a solid option. An odd aside: if you like your room service this may not be the place for an extended stay.

First of all, the staff, from those attending the front-desk, restaurants, pool/spa, up to the baggage handling, all were very helpful and friendly. No one was negative or came off as rude or abrupt. More importantly, the room was quite nice too. I neither found it small nor lacking anything. Everything was clean, in place, and tastefully done, from the daytime service to the nightly turndown. Reading other comments, I was surprised that other guests smelled odd odors and said the rooms were in need of repair and refurbishing. Maybe it depends o the room, but mind was quite a nice one with a view of the Merlion, although quite away in the distance. Our rate included breakfast, which had a wide selection. If included with the room rate, it is well worth it. I've been to quite a few lavish hotel breakfast buffets, but this one was the first to offer homemade ice-creams with all the toppings. They were tempting, but I can only eat so much. It was a nice touch, and definitely a break from the usual. Overall, I have seen better breakfast spreads, but how much do we really need? It is simply fine, with a good array of not only western and Asian foods but also traditional breakfast and brunch selections too. Plus, if you don't like air conditioning (like me), you can sit outside too and enjoy your breakfast, which was a pleasant option. All in all, I cannot find fault with the hotel itself. The only thing that would make it perfect would be to move it a little closer to a major attraction or station. But since this is impossible, it doesn't count as a suggestion for improvement. Anyway, taxis are very reasonable. And since walking is good for me, I was able to walk to the Merlion Park, River Walk, Raffles Hotel, Raffles City Shopping center and City Hall Station. Plus, three big shopping centers are right next door: the Millennium Walk, Suntec City Mall (with Carrefour), and the Marina Square. All in all, the Conrad is convenient enough to see parts of Singapore on foot, while still offering very pleasant hotel accommodations too.

The check-in process was very smooth and the staff were very courteous (which is pretty much the case anywhere in Singapore). As a gold member of the Hilton Hhonors programme we were upgraded to a business room with free breakfast and late checkout. The rooms had fantastic views the Marina area. The rooms were spacious, fresh and impeccably maintained. We loved the quirky touch of having a cute teddy bear and rubber ducky. The pillow menu featuring 13 different pillow types was also and eccentric touch - we didn't indulge in this particular offering as the bed and pillows provided were more than adequate.
