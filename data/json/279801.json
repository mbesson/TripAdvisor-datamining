All in all we had a nice time but this property could take some tips from some of the Hilton Grand Vacation properties we have stayed at in the past. The property was not as clean as it could have been , for example there was a red Solo cup in one of the elevators that stayed there for 2 days before it was cleaned up. The doors to the lobby were filthy and filled with smudges and hand prints, same for the elevators. When we got back to the property from dinner one evening we were greeted by an obviously intoxicated young lady from ther balcony with a megaphone screaming at everyone that it was her birthday while you tried to get into the resort from the parking lot. The pool restrooom had one of the toilet paper dispensers ripped off the wall and was absolutely filthy, our room smelled like mildew, and really could have used some updating. I did get a service at the spa and the nicest way I can phrase it is that it was really lacking in professionalism and service level. While the service I had was satisfactory, the staff at the spa itself could use some polish. Also, there really should be a changing area with towels, lockers, etc. I feel like having to go across the lobby to the public restroom before my treatment sort of takes away from the experience. I can't even tell you the name of my thearapist because she never introduced herself to me. The in house restaurant was horrible, I would not recommend the breakfast buffet to anyone, ever. We didn't dare attempt another meal on property after that experience. On the plus side, the pools were great, very family friendly and they offered a ton of activities for families throughout the day. They offered a Luau that sounded like a great time, but we were weary of the food after our breakfast experience, so we did not try it. All in all not a horrible experience, but we will probably not be back.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Danbury, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNice stay at DBR\u201d", "Author": "Danielle H", "ReviewID": "UR138565844", "Content": "We loved the view from our room and liked the location.

(I am now 54 yrs. old and I was born and raised in Miami, Florida and I still live here!). We stayed at the Daytona Beach Resort and Conference Center (DBR). I had a great time remembering the fabulous surf, the wonderful people and the laid-back experience of taking a beach vacation. I took my wife and two kids (my daughter is 9 yrs. old and my son is 11). We went on 8/4/12 and left on 8/7/12. On the first day, we unleashed the kids into the ocean and all 3 of the hotel's fabulous outdoor pools, the kids pool, (which has those \"mushroom structures\" that rain water down upon the children like at the waterparks), or the indoor pool or their 2 indoor hot tubs right next to the indoor pool, After a day at the beach and the pools, and two hours before sunset, take your car and turn right out of the hotel (North), go slow and find a street on your right that takes you down to the beach. Turn right and you are headed to the boardwalk. Maintain the speed limit of 10 mph and roll down your windows. What a ride----driving on a beach!!!!!! Fabulous!!!!. When you get to the boardwalk there are many T-shirt shops, a small go-kart track, a Ferris Wheel, a video and parlor game arcade, fast food shops and other stores, This boardwalk is on the beach!! So you should only wear T-shirts, Hawaiian shirts, shorts, sun dresses, sandals or flip-flops.. If that's not enough, you can stay at the hotel and slather on more sun block and stay by the water or you can take a 45 minute trip north to St. Augustine.and visit the Oldest Wooden School House in America ($4.95 per adult and something less for young kids...yes, the State of Florida charges school age children to visit the Oldest Wooden School House...never understood that policy---charging children to visit a school.) There are many other wonderful attractions to visit in St. Augustine so visit. www.augustine.com. St. Augustine is a very old city, so it is very small. You really don't have to buy those trolley tickets to ride around the city and see it if you are in good to fair physical condition. (But I must say, for $55.00 it was probably worth it for my family to jump on and off the train just to get the breeze in your face and cool off on a hot August afternoon.. (Also, the tour guides who drive the trolleys give you alot more historical information then you might get out of a history book). Of course, the Fountain of Youth discoverd by Juan Ponce de Leon is located in St. Augustine. This park is just a mile or so north of the old city. There is free parking there or, if you buy the trolley tickets, it's one of the stops. (Do not expect something like Niagara Falls, it's more like one of your kids leaving your garden hose at half-on. But hey!.. It's the Fountain of Youth and they let you taste the water!!!). If you still want to stay at the hotel and slather on more sun block and stay by the water you can do that, or you can take a 45 minute trip south to the Kennedy Space Center. If you have never been there or you have kids, it's an amazing place. Buy the cheapest entry fee you can get, ($45.per adult and $35 for children 3-11 yrs. old--a bit pricey for what you get since NASA is not launching shuttles anymore). You will get a narrated bus ride around the VAB (Vehicle Assembly Building) and see the \"crawler\" that takes assembled rockets to the launch pad. They also have the Apollo/Saturn V rocket museum which is amazing The IMAX movies are great! You can easily spend 7 hours there. The food costs about the same as a movie theater. But hey!.. you're on vacation!!! Orlando, and those wonderful theme parks, are about 1 hour away. But that's another vacation review that I'm sure you have already read about! Please read below for some tips!!!! Tips: !) Daytona Beach is known for \"Spring Break\", \"Bike Week\" (when motorcyclists come to Daytona Beach, but they can fill up the hotel rooms fast and I'm sure the hotels cost more!) Furthermore, in the winter time, NASCAR comes to town! It's a great time for racing fans but that event can fill up rooms fast as well. 2.)Take advantage of \"off periods\" and there are plenty of them! Go to www.daytonabeach.com and download their visitor's guide. It has the schedule of the events I described above and you can work around those dates and get some pretty good prices.. 3) At the Daytona Beach Reort and Conference Center, I would recommend getting the 1 bedroom suite. What the DBR did was take a room facing the ocean and knocked out the wall to the room facing the street. Then they took out the second bathroom (in the room facing the ocean) and made a kitchen out of it). The rest of the room that faces the ocean they made into a family area. The room that faces the street, (which is very far away from the street and, as such, you cannot hear traffic noise) has two queen beds, which were very comfortable. This resort is 2.5 miles north of the boardwalk. Perfect!!! Away from the noise and bright lights. Very easy to drive to the boardwalk, by beach or road. 4.) Take advantage of the suite's amenities. The suite has plates, cups and utensils. It also has a small microwave oven, a full size refrigerator and dual stove-top oven and a coffee maker. There are many grocery stores in the neighborhood of the DBR. Buy bread, milk, juices, water, cold cuts, cereal,etc. Save a little money on breakfast, lunch and dinner by buying for \"in-house\" meals. But I must say, the restaurant in the lobby is very good and, for a beach resort, fairly priced! 5) Parking is free. But the staff will not tell you about the \"resort fee\" which is $16.88 per day/per room until you check out. So add that into the cost per day for the room when you plan your stay. Overall, our stay was excellent!

On this occasion, more so than the last, it was very noticeable on the diminished level of service. The rooms were nice and access to the beach was great.

When we arrived in the evening, we had a very nice time at the pool bar getting a dinner tip from the bartenders. Loved the bartenders at the pool bar. They were nice and helpful when we had questions about places in the area. Also, provided great drink suggestions. The pool area had a DJ which was nice to hear music and activities. However, when we woke in the morning and went to shower, we noticed there were no soaps, shampoos or other bathroom amenities. It was about 7:45am. We called down to the hotel desk and they told us we would have to go down to the desk ourselves, since housekeeping didn\u2019t start until 8am. Very disappointing. Also, our room wasn\u2019t cleaned until around 5pm!!!

I think what was the kicker for me was when the front desk person told me they had wireless. I asked him why I was in his lobby with my laptop when I have wireless in my room.

My wife and I stay from last Sunday (7/15) thru Saturday(7/21). We booked this hotel through Bookit.com and didn't have any problem with check in or our Universal and Islands of Adventure Passes. (BTW I highly recommend to get those through Bookit.com if you're booking your stay through them.) Having read some reviews on the hotel before leaving I was not sure what we were going to be getting into. Now I'm going to do my best to give a full review of this hotel for everyone. Hotel: Yes this hotel is a little older, however Daytona is a little older town than your typical beach town so don't hold that against the hotel. Now that being said the resort could upgrade the Mattresses. I'm not sure if it's every room, but our room 219 (King suite) the mattress was AWFUL. I woke up monday with a stiff neck from the springy mattress and flat pillows. The mattress in our room was wore out and needed to be replaced. It was bad enough that we were going to use the fold out couch to sleep on for the rest of the week, but guess what it was crappy to. Sunday when we arrived the moment I walked through the day there was a slight smell to the room, my wife couldn't smell it but it was the smell of a light body odor I guess you would say. Now after monday I don't know if It went away or if I got use to it, however I couldn't smell it anymore. Cleanliness: Other than the slight smell in the room the first couple of days the room was pretty clean at check in. Beds were made, dishes put up Etc. However, the inner shower curtain should be replaced, there was mold on it. IN ROOM SAFE: our room DID NOT have a in room safe, not sure about the others, I would assume they do not, but I do not know. Because of this we keep our DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door so the maids would not come into the room. Having Jewelry and my professional camera equipment for photography in the room we didn't want to chance anything. Privacy: We did have a balcony on our room that you could sit on, however like one reviewer stated before it's like they turned an outside entrance into the balcony's and there is NO wall between you and your neighbors just railing. So no walking out on the balcony naked J/K lol. The walls are pretty thin, our neighbors had a toddler and she liked to run from one end of the room to the other early in the morning and it was like she was in the room with us. Also the last night we were their some of our drunk neighbors 3 rooms down decided to come into the halls and talk extremely loud and we could hear every word they were saying at 1AM. GYM: Now I know most people don't work out on their vacation, however I do still like to train a few days a week while on vacation. Now if you're like me i'd suggest get a week pass at Planet Fitness 2 blocks down, cause it's not a gym, I wouldn't even call it a fitness center. They have a treadmill and elipical and 2 machines with some weight on them, but no free weights. POOLS: 2 pools outside 8ft-3.5ft and then one kiddy type pool also outside, then one pool inside with 2 hot tubs. Also like other reviewers, the inside pool has ALOT of chemicals in it and they do burn your eyes a bit if you get water in your eyes. POOLSIDE bar: We only got 1 drink and it was over priced and weak. STAFF: There are a few reviews that state they staff is rude, I did not experience this. BEACH: The beach was nice. It may be crowded to some, however for what my wife and I are use to it was extremely calm and that made the 8 hour drive worth it.

Being alergic to mold, that was not a good omen! When we headed out to get dinner, we stopped at the front desk and I spoke with Michael. He apologized and asked if he could put an ionizer in the room while we were out to help reduce the mold. He also said that he would move us to another room in the section that had been recently redone where he guaranteed that there would be no mold. When we retruned to our room, the mold was much less evedent. In the morning, Michael had already arranged to move us (the hotel was sold out the night before). He also mentioned that he would be happy to move us to a suite, but could not do so without a slight additional fee. When he told me the cost, I jumped at the opportunity.

The oceanfront room with a balcony, kitchen (full sized refrig, glass top burners and microwave as well as a toaster) bedroom and great bathroom made our stay awesome! We loved every minute! We will look forward to returning in the future as this was a great choice of hotels! The housekeeping staff was also excellent! The pools were great (if you want a chair on the weekend, get down to the pool early!). If you want a lot of sun, sit on the South East side of the deck as that area has the sun the longerst.

We stayed in one of the larger suites which had a small kitchen, couch, table, and then a seperate sleeping area (although it is really all just one big room). The property was very clean, quiet, and there were not a lot of people when we were there in Feburary. The hotel has a parking garage which allows you to park on your floor which is handy if you have a lot of stuff to carry in. There is also a very nice putt-putt one block away, McDonalds two blocks away, a Denny's grocery store, and beach shop across the street. Very handy for a family. Items to note: Keep in mind that Daytona Beach has hard sand, not really the soft fluffly sea shell kind of place. Daytona Beach also allows cars to drive on the beach, which may also be a turn off for some, especially during the busy season.

Upon arrival we were terribly disappointed to see the roadway directly in front of us rather than the website advertised \"eternal views of the beautiful blue ocean and the Inter Coastal Water Way from our top floor sanctuary.\" This is a highly deceptive statement to advertise. While standing on the balcony and looking to the left you can see the beach and ocean (and the top of the building) but in no way is this what we envisioned. *The balcony did not have, nor could accommodate if they were provided, chairs or an end table. Not what you would expect in a \"resort.\" The room was also an adjoining room and we could hear, quite clearly, noise from the other room, as well as others around us. *The shower pressure in the room was exceptionally weak. I am not sure if it was because the hotel is going for a \"green\" standard or not but this was terribly unpleasant. *The television is very small for the room, estimated 23\" - we could not see it well from our beds. *The indoor pool chemicals were very strong and made use of the pool unbearable. The hot tub was exceptionally hot, almost scalding. Could not use either for longer than a few minutes. *On Wednesday I called the front desk at 7:30am to request the late checkout of 4pm, for a fee which I was aware of was $25. I was on hold for 10 minutes and then was told we could not have this option. When I asked for a checkout of anything later than 11am I was denied that as well. When I asked if there was anything she could offer me the woman said sighed and said in a tone which captured her annoyance with the situation \"no - the room has already been reserved we need to clean it.\" When I asked if she could move the people who have our specific room reserved elsewhere she said flatly \"no.\" I find it hard to believe there was nowhere, on a Wednesday, they could move a reservation to. My impression was that she simply couldn't be bothered. This was not the level of customer service I was anticipating. *So, my family and I, although frustrated, decided to make the best of the situation, since this was our vacation and wanted it to be as stress free as possible. At 8:30am we headed down to the outdoor pool area and to our utter shock found that the majority of the lounge chairs were covered with towels, yet only a dozen or so people were actually AT the pool!! People had left their towels and gone about their business, with total disregard for the people who were there to USE the pool! There was no one there to complain too, not that they would do anything anyway, as we saw signs posted on the doors saying NOT to do this.

Overall, we had a really great time, however, there were some cons. A large group rented about 3 rooms and kept their doors opened most of the time. They had several kids running in and out the rooms. There were older kids as well playing frisbee in the hall. This group or perhaps another was very loud and noisy, late night. They were screaming and yelling. I called the front desk twice, the last call was at 1:00 am, after I was awaken out of my sleep by several people yelling where they were from. The 2nd night was 100% better. I am not sure if that was because the group(s) left or were spoken to. If they can get a handle on some of the unruly guests and more staff this would be an excellent place to stay.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, MA", "Title": "\u201cOur suite was our little home on the beach.\u201d", "Author": "TwoBlackCatsInMass", "ReviewID": "UR126518439", "Content": "We had an ocean front suite.

We had booked two weeks, and while we didn't find the resort to be anything special had no real problems until Saturday night, when we and our three small children were kept awake until midnight by loud, pounding music. So sorry, nothing to be done, a wedding party has booked the space. Many apologies from the day manager the next morning. So, Sunday was pretty much a waste as we all napped all day to recover from our late night. Sunday night, we arrived back from visiting family only to find the windows in our room vibrating - according to the front desk, a \"band\" was doing a sound check for a concert to be held Monday evening. Again, sorry, but they paid for the space. Well, so did we, and we expect to be able to sleep in our hotel room! Oh, yes, they'll be gone by 10:00 pm (or 11:30) but they'll be back tomorrow for the concert. Well, I can't speak to what happened Monday night because our vacation club moved us to a smaller, quieter, more family friendly hotel. DBR's staff were all very polite and apologetic, but unable to turn down the volume. So if late nights are for you, so is DBR.

Wife really enjoyed the room, and so did our kids. We had an oceanfront room to appease the wife/kids. Besides the standard nice staff, clean rooms, blah blah blah, here are the pluses: I really liked that the room was long and had 2 TVs (one for the wife and I, and one for the kids). Athough we didnt use it, the room came with a mini kitchen, stove, frig, microwave, with pots, utensils, glasses. Another plus is that our room was close to the parking deck, which is attached to the hotel, so that I didnt have to drag everything through the main hotel lobby, elevator, etc. All I did was park on the same level as my room, and unpacked from there. I agree with the other comments, in that the parking deck is somewhat tight. We had a midsize car and we were ok. Anyone that has a huge SUV would say differently. Another plus is that there are 2 outside pools, and in addition a kiddie pool, so it was not overcrowded. I liked the fact that one end was 8ft deep so that my wife and I could enjoy it more. My kids were on the other end 3ft enjoying themselves. We enjoyed the inside pool too (water is a lot warmer). Another plus was that there was always something going on at the hotel over the weekend. There was a DJ outside playing music, the hotel had grilled hamburgers, hotdogs, chicken, for a small fee.....great atmosphere. We didnt use it, but they offered a 'parents night out' as well. There were other amenities, like the restaurants, spa, tiki bar, fire pit at night, fitness center, etc, but we did not use them. One more tip is that we enjoyed the waterpark which is about a 5 min drive. A couple of negatives: The walls in the room are kinda thin, and I could hear the people in the room next to mine during the morning we were trying to sleep in.

The service is absolutely terrible, from the moment we checked in we knew we were going to regret staying there. For starters the front desk attendant was extremely rude. We pre-booked our room through bookit.com and had chosen \"resorts choice\" but requested an ocean view. The lady rudely informed us that we had not paid for an ocean front room so we were not getting one unless we wanted to add an additional twenty dollars a night to the amount we already paid. She then proceeded to inform us that we had to pay an additional twelve dollars a night anyways for amenities (whether we were using them or not) which in the end ended up being more than the twelve a night because they still tax that amount. The next day we went to Reflections, their restaurant, for breakfast. We were the only two people in the restaurant, we waited forty-five minutes for our food to find out that our server forgot to put in our order. She comped our meal (which was probably the nicest thing that happened there). We arrived again for breakfast the next morning and the same thing happened. We spoke to the hotel manager who assured us he would direct the issue and have his GM contact us. We did not see or hear from him again until we ran in to him during check out. They could not even check us out properly, we asked for room charges on one credit card and hotel ammenity charges on the other. They assured us they did so but when we got home to check our account everything was put on one card and the security deposit still had not been returned. On top of that towels are not easy to get, you have to sign them out then return them back by that night or you get charged for them. (so much for being a \"Green\" resort!) The staff in each department was very unfriendly and unhappy to be there. One of the bartenders at the pool bar was not even carding people who were clearly underage. We were super excited for a nice weekend get away, arriving at this hotel did not allow for that. I would not recommend staying here unless it is the absolute last resort.

The first 2 nights we stayed in the standard room. I booked two doubles on the hotel's Web site, they gave me a room with a king size bed and a pull-out couch. We were mainly going to be in the room just to sleep, so we didn't care that much. We did, however, call down to the front desk and ask for sheets and blankets for the pull-out couch, they never came. Ever. Luckily there was an extra blanket on the king bed, so we used that. The last night we were there, we switched over to one of suites on the other side of the building. The room was really nice. I say it's definitely worth the money to upgrade. The bed was a lot more comfortable, too. The bathroom was huge and the private balcony was awesome. Once again, though. The pull-out couch in the living room didn't have sheets or blankets, and no extras in the room anywhere. So around 3 p.m. on Sunday, when we were in the room, we called and asked them to bring some up. They said someone was on their way. We waited for about 45 minutes and called again. They said they would have someone up there, so we told them we'd be at the pool and just to have them put it in our room. We get back to the room around 7. Still no sheets. We call again- they said nobody had called them from our room today so they had no idea. (whatever). So they say someone is coming with them. We're in our room until 9 o'clock- still nothing came. We go to the front desk before we go to dinner and watch the fireworks... they said someone will personally bring them to our room while we're gone. We get back around 1 a.m. NO SHEETS/BLANKETS! We call down there, pissed, demand sheets and blankets. Finally 15 minutes later, a security guard brought them to our room. So the reviews are correct when they say you have to pretty much take care of yourself at this hotel. BUT the staff was extremely friendly, even if they can't accommodate their guests. Also, don't waste your money at the drinks at the pool. Mix your own drinks in your room and take them with you. It was $7.00 for one of those really small plastic cups for a drink that barely had any alcohol in it. The location was good for what we wanted, but far from restaurants and the board walk. All in all, we didn't let the \"bedding experience\" ruin our trip. Just a minor glitch.

When we initially arrived we didn't know where we would stay after seeing all of the worst hotels the beach had to offer it was a relief to arrive at the daytona beach resort. It was clean and a nice modern setup we were sold. The hotel wasn't cheap by any means we spent 300 dollars for two nights and had an extra 100 dollars held for a deposit. The staff were helpful and the bell hop brought us to our room giving us a nice tour of the compound. As we made our way towards our room I was somewhat confused. The hotel tenants seemed somewhat shady and the cleaning staff seemed very blas\u00e9. Our room was a studio which was very compact. We enjoyed the facilities pool and and ordered in the first night. The second day we wanted to stay on the beach the entire day we really enjoyed ourselves and when I returned to my room to take my daily medication for my chronic asthma I noticed that our room hadn't been serviced none of the trash receptacals were emptied and the bed wasn't made; but the towels were replenished. After further inspection I realized my medications were all gone at a cost of nearly 200 dollars. We cleaned the room ourselves and searched high and low before we approached the staff mike the manager could only tell me this has never happened before and couldn't I go replace them. After talking to the general manager mike determined it was necessary to file a police report and file a claim with the hotels insurance company. They never offered to comp us anything towards our stay or offered us any restitution. They continued to question me rather than staff even implying at one point that this may have happened to me before. I was incredibly disappointed in the lack of concern for my health this wasn't a watch or a few dollars or camera this was my wellbeing. We checked out first thing in the morning and I'm currently waiting for the general manager to call me. Finally I just wanted to mention to any person of color that the racial tension could be cut with a knife. A woman yelled at her son to get out of the hot tub now even when she was getting ready to get in herself as soon as my boyfriend and I approached the hot tub to get in.

Finally, I wanted to recommend that you check out the spa services at the Terra Acqua Day Spa that is inside the hotel. The staff at the Spa were wonderful. They were very accommodating with scheduling appointments and worked around our family (we had a three year old). The atmosphere was relaxed and very professional and clean.

I wish I had found this website prior to making any arrangements to stay there. BEWARE of the pictures on their website. They are completely \"doctored\". If you look at the picture of the hotel from the \"air\", they have \"whited out\" all of the huge air conditioning units on top of the roof, which when you look out your window, that's all you see. Yes the water is off in the distance, but the roof on the southeast side of the building, and the parking lot roof on the northwest side of the buidling ruin the entire effect. The restaurant is NOT OPEN. Nor is there room service. They have one or two flaky bartenders. You are lucky to get your $8.50 drink or glass of wine in less than 1/2-hour. The spa is rediculously overpriced, $60.00 for a very basic pedicure, with 20% gratuity added on. Give me a break! The spa staff, is one person. If you want more than one service they have to call some one in. The rooms are dated and dirty. They have no chairs on the beach, (you can rent a chair for $25.00 per day from a local), and in order to get a towel you have to go into the lobby, sign your life away, and return it by the end of the day. Why they don't have towel service out by the pool is beyond me. You must be clear if you want a room with a balcony that you can actually sit on. Alot of the rooms (ours) had a walk out balcony only. I specifically asked for a room with a balcony, told reservations that I wanted to be able to \"sit out on the balcony, and just watch the water\". What I got was a 1-/2 foot piece of concrete, that overlooked a row of about 30-air conditioners. The service compeltely sucks, from the front desk, to the housekeeping, to the bar (the picture of the \"tiki\" bar on line doesn't even look like the same place). In reality is is a shabby concrete dirty structure with some palm leaves on top of it. I am not kidding, I have NEVER stayed at a place with such poor service. If you order food from the bar, the bartender disappears for about 1/2 hour, then returns with something very similar to airline food. Also, the gym shown on line does not look anything like the real thing. I don't know how these people get a way with this false advertising. I really can't say one good thing about this place. Stay with the Hiltons and the Crowne Plaza's, you get what you pay for, and if you can't afford that, stay in a tent on the beach, I'm that serious.

It was gutted and redone recently, and the tower rooms look new. Some of the non-tower rooms are very spacious, and you can get a good view of the beach in them. There are many pools/hot tubs to choose from, so it doesn't get too crowded. It is on the northern part of Daytona Beach, walking distance to Ormand Beach so it is a lot quieter than the boardwalk area. It would be a nice place to hold an event, due to the size of the hotel, but I would be afraid to do that due to the poor service. Now the negative: The lobby still looks 1970s with the mirrors, the foam tile ceilings, the old doors and windows, ugly flooring, and the gaudy metallic garbage cans, etc. The tower rooms have potential, but the green curtains, blah bedspreads, green carpet and 1980s furniture is bad. The non-tower part of the hotel does not look gutted to me. The doors and windows still look very commercial and 1960s to me. Those rooms are also a bit more run down, and are not as nicely done as the tower rooms. The beds are lumpy. We saw some suspicious stains on the carpet and furniture too (yuck!) There is also quite a bit of outside noise, especially when facing the street. I read somewhere that one of the pools was supposed to be heated, but they felt pretty cold to me... even the kids pool was freezing. I am not crazy about cars driving on the beach. You get lots of young people out cruising, which can lead to mischief and it is also quite dangerous for the beach goers who aren't aware of it, and the little ones. Everything in this hotel is way overpriced except for the rooms. I wanted a pedicure and they had to call a local employee to come in. The staff is not normally there...they are on call. She finally arrived but forgot some of her equipment, so she had no scissors. She had to file my toenails down instead of cutting! No cutical clipper either. The food is OK depending what you order. The hamburgers are not good. The guests come from all walks of life, which leads to problems, like missing pool towels. Now you have to wait for the busy front desk staff to give you towels and sign them in and out. Can't they do this outside so we don't have to walk around the lobby all wet? The front desk has always been a mess. It takes forever to check in. We got an email in writing the last time we rented with family. It stated that we had specific rooms and that they were adjoining. When we got there, after a long drive, we had to wait an hour for them to straighten out a mess. They had rented the rooms to someone else. We eventually got bigger rooms, but we wanted our own room, not someone elses. No one apologized and my husband was visibly upset. Instead of trying to calm him down by saying \"we are so sorry we messed up. I see you have it in writing that you reserved specific rooms, including your own. I know you have driven a long way and would like to get settled immediately, so let me get you another adjoining room as quickly as possible. I will get you the nicest room we have, etc...\" you get my point. Instead, we got incompetent front desk staff who were rude and wanted us to pay double what we were supposed to pay, so they could fix the problem. One of them told her boss that my husband yelled at her, and I didn't hear any yelling. The boss came out and YELLED at my husband and myself. Extremely unprofessional. This is no Marriott, let me tell you. The service is horrible. Even the little convenience store they have doesn't carry toiletries and closes around dinner time. I always find expired items for sale, including milk. I don't even know why they have that store. Vending machines would be better. Luckily, there is a Publix and Walgreens across the street. The best thing that could happen to this place is for a huge hotel chain to buy them out so they can be a real hotel and not a condo with staff that has no clue about hospitality.", "Date": "September 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cCaution Advised\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoKen60657", "ReviewID": "UR40632219", "Content": "We stayed three nights. The hotel bills you for the first night upon making the reservation. There is also a $100 deposit refundable deposit. I was not aware of this until checking in although in all fairness it was noted on the reservation confirmation. Upon arriving at the hotel I discovered it was a condominium hotel; that was the first condo hotel experience for me; would not do that again. Our room was the standard hotel room. I was looking forward to having a balcony. However, the balcony was only about two feet deep at most. I wanted a balcony with chairs so we upgraded to an ocean front room with full balcony. The $100 deposit fee, which I never encountered before, put me on the defensive. So I called the front desk from each room and noted every scratch and stain I observed. But then a bigger problem was noted in the upgraded room. The kitchen was crawling with ants. I complained to the front desk. The clerk said \"Well, this is Florida\" but offered to change rooms. We declined but requested that maintenance spray. The maintenance man said he could take care of the kitchen but that wasn't the source of the problem. They ostensibly were coming from the outside via the living room carpet. With that we again changed rooms. Our latest suite was nice (as was the previous suite except for the ants). But again, being on guard, I made a list of nine scrathes, scrapes and stains and delivered it to the front desk so I wouldn't be accused of damaging property. Had never done this before. A second shift front office clerk didn't seem pleased when I asked her to make a copy and initial receipt. I was somewhat paranoid at this point. Our first night's stay was interrupted by noisy neighbors at 1:00 AM in the connecting room next door. Re having a balcony, if you want to sit there, request a full-size balcony, not what they refer to as a step-out balcony. Forget about eating at the hotel. Don't be deceived by the fine dining internet photo with burgundy table clothes and wine glasses. They closed the full service restaurant in October 2008. It only offers the poolside cabana menu. Stepping in early one evening, the place was empty and the decor barren. There is a carry-out place where you can purchase pre-packaged food items to take to your room or poolside. Fortunately, you can get a hearty breakfast at Denny's across the street. Also, there a couple of good local restaurants just north of the hotel. One on the east side of the street is Barnacles. On the other side and a bit farther north is The Charlie Horse. When it came time to check out, I called the front desk to have someone inspect the room before departing. A housekeeper stopped by and made a perfunctory inspection, throwing some bathroom towels on the floor in the process. I thought that was the inspection. Apparently not. As I was ready to leave a housekeeping supervisor arrived to inspect the room. She waited for me to leave. I said I want to remain for the inspection. She retorted that I might do something after she left. I said I will leave with you. She gave the place a thorough going over looking in and at everything. She even turned on each of the TVs stating that some people pour water into the back of the TV. (You've got to be kidding!) She then phoned the front desk and gave the all clear. We left the room together. The hotel staff was extremely friendly except for housekeeping and one desk clerk.

They were clean with lots of pool chairs. Loved turning the pool chair around and looking out at the ocean while laying there. Also they had a separate childrens pool oceanfront with two mushroom shaped waterfalls. Pools were always clean. They also have an indoor pool and two hottubs. Very nice! We used the hottubs briefly each day after we were done on the beach. The indoor pool area was kept clean and looked updated. One thing we like also was to get back up to the hotel (pool area) you had to have an access card which cuts down on people just running up and using the pools that aren't staying there. They have three different shower things to clean the sand off when you get off the beach also. Over all very nice! Will be returning here a few more times this summer!

We did change our room to an oceanfront and that was a nice room with the exception of a musty smell, which did clear up after turning the air on and opening the door for a while. We woke the next morning and went downstair to eat breakfast at the restaurant and that is when we found out that it had been closed since October of 08', then later that day for lunch we discovered that there was not room service as well. The pool bar was nice but it closed at 6 oclock and their seemed to always be plenty of people still wanting to be served food & drinks at the pool. The entire atmosphere there seemed almost as if the place was \"going under\" and it was just a matter of time before it closed. I can't explain it exactly, it was just weird because the place has a lot of potential and for the most part is clean but for a place of that size it seemed like they were extremely understaffed and couldn't stay afloat.

It's their \"one-bedroom oceanfront condo.\" Let me start by saying that it is SO worth it to have a room with a kitchen (every room has one here), especially in our case with 6 people. I spent $203 at Publix when we arrived, and we ate all of our meals (9 total) in the room. I don't even want to start doing the math on what it would have cost for all 6 of us to eat those 9 meals out. The room was updated and clean, the service was great, the location was perfect, the pools, pool furniture and pool area were very well maintained, the elevators were fast, and the common areas were immaculate. It's obvious that this hotel is working real hard to renew its image along with its $34 million transformation. There's a Publix across the street, in a shopping plaza that also has a Bealls, a dollar store and a dozen or so smaller shops. There's a Walgreens and a beachy souvenir-type store across the street, as well. Publix and Walgreens have everything you need for the beach and pool--from coolers to floats to fishing poles to chairs and sunscreen. The \"action\" by the Pier/Ocean Walk was a 5-minute drive north. A big plus is the covered parking garage manned by a security guard. In addition to keeping our car safe and out of the sun, the garage also gave easy access to our room. We parked on the third level and walked to our third-floor room through an interior access door from the garage. Both times I called the front desk for service (once for extra pillows and once for a faucet issue), there was someone at our door within minutes--and the pillows were even toasty warm! All of the employees we came in contact with were friendly and helpful. We didn't eat at the restaurant, use the fitness or business center or frequent the poolside tiki bar, but all were open and being enjoyed by other guests. There also was a laundry room on our floor; possibly on every floor. The beach was just steps out the gate of the pool area; a company that rents beach umbrella/lounge chair combos sets up out front each morning. I had dreaded the \"cars on the beach\" thing, but it really wasn't bad at all; it may be worse during busier times of the year. There's a lifeguard on duty directly to the left of the hotel. Although the hotel website had the 1-bedroom oceanfront condo listed for $239/night, we got it through Expedia for $171.75/night + we found an Expedia coupon code that subtracted $10/night + we got a free $50 gas card by using our MasterCard to reserve the room. We ended up paying a total of $177.40/night when adding taxes and the $12/day resort fee back in. Not bad for a great hotel and a great room with a great view! A comment on the resort fee: I read a handful of reviews by people who were not happy with the $12/day fee and gave the hotel a lower rating because of it. The hotel says the fee covers the covered parking garage, a daily USA Today newspaper at your door, 2 bottles of water a day, local calls, wireless internet access and access to the fitness center and resort amenities. We appreciated most of those things but think the hotel would be better off building the fee into their room rates and saying those things are \"free\" rather than charging a daily fee. That way, guests who don't use any of those things won't feel like they're being forced to pay for something they don't want. If I had to provide any constructive feedback at all, it would be that there's not a lot to do aside from the beach and pools--and no entertainment is within walking distance. It seems a resort of this size would offer a game room, a putting green, shuffleboard, basketball, a mini-movie theather, a common area with TVs or something as entertainment in addition to the pools and hot tubs. We had a car, so we ended up going to Congo River to play mini golf one night and walking around the Ocean Walk entertainment complex another night. We had a great trip overall, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend or stay at the Daytona Beach Resort and Conference center again in the future. If you stayed here in the past and had a not-so-great experience, it's definitely worth another try!", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristow, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel on the Beach\u201d", "Author": "Soonergirl1", "ReviewID": "UR17800395", "Content": "I came to this resort as part of a business trip. What a nice place! My colleague had an oceanfront room on the third floor and enjoyed the view and her balcony every day. My room was a very large room on the ninth floor - I had a tiny ocean view and tiny balcony, but a wall of windows facing the city! I also had a small living room area and a huge bathroom plus a fully stocked kitchen. The bed was wonderful!! I slept very well the whole time I was there except on the Saturday night I was there - there was a lot of street noise, and I had to put in earplugs. After that, I slept well. The lobby at the hotel is beautiful and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The pools are beautiful (the indoor pool is quite large for an indoor pool) and we enjoyed the live music at the pool on the weekend plus the fire pit at night. We did have trouble finding many places to eat around there - there is a Denny's, Ruby Tuesday's, Olive Garden and Red Lobster, but my colleague didn't like seafood and I am not wild about pasta, so there wasn't much left! We did eat in the hotel restaurant and had a great meal and our waiter was wonderful! I wouldn't take my small children there, but if you were with some older children or adults, it's a very nice place to eat. All in all, I had a fabulous time at this resort and enjoyed being right on the beach. We were about two miles away from the Boardwalk and pier, but considering all the noise down there, I didn't consider it a bad thing. I enjoyed my stay and intend to bring my family down there one of these days. My kids will love it!", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jacksonville, FL", "Title": "\u201cGREAT TIME!\u201d", "Author": "GirlsfromJAX", "ReviewID": "UR16977957", "Content": "Looking for a quick getaway for the weekend....called the hotel day before and beat all the advertised rates online!

We had a 3 year old with us and we were able to keep him occupied with lots of nearby attractions. Parking on the same floor as your room is a bonus but parking is at a premium when the hotel is busy. The kitchenette in our room was very nice and the fact that a major shopping center is across the road means you don't have to eat out at every meal. The gym was very small, but had enough equipment for a decent workout. Strangely enough, staff turned the other cheek when I mentioned that I had been forced to witness an old man in a Speedo (no T-shirt or shoes) on an ellipse machine ahead of me. (and yet we got a phone call from the front desk when we hung a towel to dry on our balcony) We did find that the hotel has a lot of rules to maintain a perception of propriety. Some rules are posted (no coolers on pool deck) why others are not. Towards the end of our stay, we actually started to have fun seeing how many we could ignore. (withour being a pain to other guests of course) Cleaning staff were very friendly and worked around our schedule. All 3 pools were nice, large and clean, but if you need to get to the ocean, you have to have a pass key with you to get back in. (a major pain if you are alone and if you want to swim without losing your key card) Our family did not find the front desk staff very helpful when seeking tourist info about attractions such as Disney (or even stuff close by), but for the rest they were friendly and helpful. On the ocean side, watch which room you get. A loud music system comes on precisely at 8 am and shuts off at 10 pm. (on a timer) As a result, we could not keep our balcony door open to enjoy the ocean sounds while our child slept. We raised this with the front desk on our last day and they replied that the owner had specifically requested the music be turned up. (I found it odd that my concerns were simply brushed aside, as a customer, in favour of an owner's wishes) If you stay above the third floor, you will be happy. (unless you want the lud music) We never ate in the restaurant...but the menu looks OK. (it's more suited for a business meeting than a vacation dinner with a child) Forget using the 'business center' to keep up with your e-mail. Internet access is very pricey. I recommend this hotel to any family.....", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Daytona Beach Resort and Conference Center", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34172-d279801-Reviews-Daytona_Beach_Resort_and_Conference_Center-Daytona_Beach_Florida.html", "Price": "$87 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2700 N Atlantic Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Daytona Beach</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">32118</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "279801", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/9c/b2/9cb2ccbab45aa936b705c03b0acf4bb77large.jpg"}}
