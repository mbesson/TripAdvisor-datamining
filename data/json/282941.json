The pick pocketers are immigrants of Arab or black race so stay clear.

With this in mind, what I was looking for was a cheap hotel and something that places me as close in the colour of life in central Barcelona as possible. With Hotel Barbara this is just what you get. Rooms wise the hotel is extremely basic, I am unsure if they have any food options as we didn't even attempt to ask. This is a hotel for someone who essentially would like somewhere near the centre of town to crash when not out exploring the beautiful and vivid city. The hotel is situated right near La Rambla, and as other reviews have stated, being so close does mean that the area is frequented by prostitutes and is quite lively outside its doors. I myself cannot complain about this noise filtering through into my room at night and therefore cannot verify some of the other reviews that might have been written by people on a different side of the hotel from myself. Yes there are prostitutes outside who can be more than a little persistent. I found the best way to deal with this is to take it as philosophically as possible, and without condoning it, greet it as another part of the Barcelona experience. If you are on the kind of trip where you want to hit the allies of a great European city, eat breakfast somewhere a little different every morning, grab a can of Estrella and sit on some steps and take in the life of Barcelona then this hotel will give you the basis to do that from. If however you prefer somewhere a little more comfortable than a bedroom in town to leave your stuff in and grab some rest in, then Hotel Barbara may not be for yourself. It is not a luxury hotel destination and it is not suited for the whole family after certain hours. However, it is a hotel that allows people in the city who wanna see the sights, rent a bike and ride around for a day and catch some dinner on La Rambla with very little time spent in the hotel to do just that!", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bali, Indonesia", "Title": "\u201cGood location but noisy and prostitutes area\u201d", "Author": "Nia01", "ReviewID": "UR123786829", "Content": "Hotel is falling apart we got en suite room with broken window.

We thought it was ok to pay 20euros and leave our money there, so that's what we did. The negative was that we could hear the next door flush and shower, and early in the morning there was some noise from the cleaning ladies, but generally it was ok. The location is excellent, very close to the Ramblas and we also bought from the mini markets close to the hotel, owned by indy or pakistans, but nice and cheap (especially water). We were both satisfied with our stay at hotel barbara.", "Date": "May 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cCheap and cheerful though don't forget your earplugs!\u201d", "Author": "Belly1505", "ReviewID": "UR12318572", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights over new year with my boyfriend and 4 other friends. Having read the reviews it was what we expected. We paid \u00a3128 each for 4 nights [through easytobook.com]. It is very central - 5 mins walk from La Ramblas. As people say it is not a very nice area, but now l have been l can safely say anywhere round La Ramblas is the same, everyone looks dodgy and every street seedy but it's fine you just need to be aware. When people say it is noisy it isn't outside which is what l thought they meant but INSIDE the hotel. It was quiet around 3am-5am when we got to bed [except for a most annoying clicking outside the window and a couple having a huge screaming match] but the residents were really bloody noisy early in the morning 6am-10am [fine if you're an early bird and don't want a lie in] and as for the cleaners - they sounded like they were having a party, seriously it sounded like there were about 10 of them and they spent what seemed hours outside our door. They are also v keen to clean your room [daily] which is good but not if you want some rest! I had to keep saying no thank you in spanish over and over. I also said no to towels repeatedly to get rid of her - in the end she actualyl left some outside so was all good. Reception were helpful, they sorted a taxi and gave me a double instead of a twin on request. The place was clean. Mattress was actuallly good but we had to put it on the floor and prop the bed against the wall as it was so squeaky! Shower was a laughable dribble but thankfully hot. It's basic but you get what you pay for and if like us you literally want to kip [seriously get ear plugs tho!] and somewhere to wash it's fine. Also if you go in winter remember to put the fan on as it was bloody cold with the thin blanket and sheet. Hookers outside at 10am and either their pimps or dealers milling about all the time but we didn't get any hassle, just don't make eye contact and it's fine.

I was a bit skeptical walking down the street, and after staying in the 2 star hotel in Amsterdam, I expected this to be pretty much the same type - very cramped, not very clean, fairly out of the way, etc. I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised! The room was not gigantic, but by no means was it cramped. Everything was clean, the bathroom spacious enough, and the staff was fantastic! The location is perfect, about midway up the Ramblas. Just outside the hotel is a hub of prostitution, but no one harasses you, and they just keep to their business, so that's not an issue. I would not recommend to any families, or anyone looking for luxury.

The bed was pretty uncomfortable and creeky but didn't prevent me from sleeping (certainly after a couple of beers anyway!)

Yes, my friends and I saw prostitutes right outside, however the receptionist \"jordi\" told us exactly where to go to avoid any trouble, and I can honestly say that as 3 girls we did not feel threatened once. The police presence is huge to avoid any trouble. The hotel Barbara is an excellent location to explore Barcelona, especially the nightlife as everything is so close.
