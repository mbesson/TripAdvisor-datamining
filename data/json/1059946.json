I booked on the internet and didn't really know what to expect, but it was really fun. We got room A1, and I recommend it to anybody if you can get it. It is on the top floor of the palazzo, and it is definitely not for the week-kneed or faint-hearted, you have to climb up three floors, with your luggage, because the elevator only goes up to the second (first in Italy) floor. Once you're there, though, too cool. The room is a double-height ceiling, with an antique Murano chandelier, huge! Two windows looking out in two different directions on the canal, beautiful silk wall coverings and draperies. The bathroom, like so many in Venice, was minimal, to say the least, but it had it's own heater, paradise! Our room had it's own heater, too, controlled by the front desk, but it did work and we were cozy and warm which, given the nasty weather, was quite nice. Outside our room was a vast sitting area with windows and mirrors, looked like a museum. Breakfast room, tiny. Get there early or be prepared to wait, we never had to. Service and coffee were fine, or you could take a tray of breakfast up to your room. Staff spoke excellent English. Only knock: their WiFi basically doesn't work.

The room was also very clean. There is a school right next to the hotel so if you are trying get rest in the room during the day it's not going happen with all the kids screaming. The only negative thing was that there was no A/C when we visited. The front desk said it was because of the time of year. I would recommend getting lost in Venice.

The hotel was ideally located from St. Marks Square, and the room was great. The hotel has two impressive old antique rooms, which are common areas, but with no real usage to the traveller. There is an nice breakfast served but the location could not be worse. Next to the lobby are four tables and at any given time we were coming and had to wait or being stared at from other travellers to wait for a seat to open up. Its really not understandable why a owner would create such a felt like 5 sq m breakfast area, where such great old impressive rooms are left to no usage at all. I asked the reception and the answer why such a decision was made was: because we do not have a kitchen there. Coming myself fom the hotel business this seems a lame excuse, italian breakfast includes an hot beverage and croissants, no egg dish has to be prepared, and even though no kitchen is available, enough tableware and coffee could be provided.

Even the amount of bread was sporadic, as one day I received two rolls and a croissant, the next was two rolls and two croissants, and the final day was one roll and one croissant.

We had booked a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsuperior\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 room, which was well worth the extra cost for the space and view, and represented value for money. There was highly efficient air-conditioning which permitted sleep at the front of the building where some motorised boats pass. The shower room was smaller than those pictured on various websites, but modern and certainly adequate, with usual toiletries provided. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother bringing a hairdryer, as they are efficient here. The 2nd floor was spacious with a huge lounge area, as on the first floor, the latter overlooking the canal. The staff are friendly, helpful and can communicate well in English. Ask for a map on arrival to navigate round the city more quickly. Check-in and check-out were prompt and efficient. Breakfast was adequate, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had better at similarly-priced hotels in Venice: rolls, croissants, biscotti, cereal (choice of 2), juice and yoghurt and excellent cappuccino. A couple of extra Euros on the cost to improve the breakfast would make this hotel even more attractive. The breakfast room itself is really a corridor, leading to one of the guest rooms, and seats only 10 people, so we had a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 wait one morning, but have experienced this in other Venetian hotels. One website description that it overlooks \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthe private internal courtyard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is best ignored. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no view while at breakfast. The main concern is that from the 2nd floor, where the larger rooms are, there are no emergency exit signs (or any from 2nd to 1st floor) to the ground floor, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit of a maze. This needs to be addressed immediately. Getting to the hotel should be very easy, but the front is covered in graffiti and there is no hotel name on it at all! Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t let this worry you on arrival. It in no way indicates the quality inside. Follow the instructions given, then use the building number (above the door). It really is only about 60m along the canal. If you get to the Ponte dei Greci, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve missed it, so turn back! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great location, very close to San Zaccaria water bus stop from which is a main one, so very convenient. There are no bridges between the water bus from Piazzale Roma to the hotel and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a flat walk. Make sure you go into the San Zaccaria church and pay the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1 to go into the crypt, which floods from time to time.
