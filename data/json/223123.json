We were slightly taken aback when we had to check in through a glass window. The lobby closes from 7pm - 6am everyday. That's almost half of every single day that guests are not allowed into the lobby, not even from inside the actual hotel itself. It kind of made us worried about our own safety when the staff appeared to be so closed off from potential danger! There is a night security guard, so that helped a little. There are absolutely NO amenities besides a bar of soap and some plastic cups. There's not even a clock in the room! I've stayed in close to hundreds of hotels in my life and I've never had to pay the full price up front. So, we weren't able to split the bill between 4 of us (like I was hoping to do at check out). I don't mind cheap hotels, but this was the cheapest, sketchiest, sleaziest hotel I've ever encountered.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tyler, Texas", "Title": "\u201cWonderfully Surprised!\u201d", "Author": "PigFox C", "ReviewID": "UR132843414", "Content": "My wife and I arrived a day early for a high school reunion last week-end and the fancy-schmancy hotel we reserved for the week-end on St. Ann Street in the French Quarter was booked up for that night so we had to find something close by for the night. My wife found the Motel 6 on the Internet so we looked at the reviews and they sounded pretty darn good! When we drove into the parking lot we noticed the parking area was gated and the entrances to the rooms were on the inside like a hotel, instead of opening outside like most motels. One needs a scan key to enter the building if not entering through the lobby. The room was spacious, just like one reviewer said. It looks like the building used to be a hotel bought out by the Motel 6 chain, I don't know. The restroom was roomy, too, bigger than the one we had at the pricier Place d'Arms the next two days. The towels have seen better days, though, but they still dried! The room had a desk and the Wifi signal was strong. The air conditioner was plenty cold like I like, much to my wife's dismay! It's only an eleven minute drive to the French Quarter from there. If you're thinking about sightseeing the French Quarter area and want a nice room for a great price, this is the place. You'll feel very secure in your room and there are plenty of fast food places nearby if you need a quick meal.

They are dirt cheap without the dirt. They normally let children stay free. This means if there is one adult and children, you get a room with two beds at no additional fee. But this one suprised me last week by charging for two beds. Motel 6 doesn't normally charge by the bed, but by how many adults are in the room. I guess this one is independantly owned so they can do this. And they did it without offering any explaination. You would think if you are going to have a very different policy than the rest of the motels in your chain have you would at least kindly explain this to the guest instead of going about buisness like nothing strange is occuring. Also they way they vary from the Motel 6 norm is having check out time at 11 instead of 12. Of course when a customer is suprised they act like everything is normal, like they don't see what the big deal is when like 1000 Motel 6's do things one certain way and they decide to make some changes for the worse.

Down the street from the Motel6 is a \"Fantastic Soul Food\" takeout or eat in (certain hours) The food is down to earth good soul food, prices reasonable, even Stevie Wonder has eaten there.
