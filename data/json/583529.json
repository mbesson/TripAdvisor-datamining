{"Reviews": [{"Content": "International Bamboo and Rattan is OK, but... ... The beds feel like there is only a box spring on the frame. Comfortable ONLY if you like sleeping on a board. The thermostat did not work in many of our groups rooms and we had to open the window to avoid a stuffy room.Also, be warned there is no cab service until 0700 in the morning. If you have an early flight out of Beijing, you will have to arrange with the hotel to hire a private car to take you to the airport. IT IS A MUST YOU DO THIS THE NIGHT BEFORE YOU PLAN TO LEAVE.On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and helpful and most spoke at least some English. The hotel was clean and breakfast is included with your room.There is a store close-by down the street where you can buy grocery items and there is a refrigerator in every room.", "Date": "Dec 15, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR522711941", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d583529-r4244705-Beijing_International_Bamboo_and_Rattan_Tower-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "583529", "Price": "$85"}}
