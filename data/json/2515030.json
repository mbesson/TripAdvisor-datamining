First, when we were there in 2010, they offered a lovely free breakfast. When we went in 2011, we were informed that they no longer provide a free breakfast, though we could now buy breakfast. Second, the hotel has changed to the new trend which provides liquid soap in a container on the wall rather than providing a bar of soap and a small bottle of shampoo.

Small, cozy, clean, modern, organized, simple but tasteful, quiet, and a good location. It has changed. I just arrived last night, and noticed two main changes: 1) Instead of Aveda soap products, they now have Tommy Banana dispensers (feels more like a Sheraton or Hyatt or Hotel 8), and 2) the free breakfast area is now a pay-as-you-go cafe (which few use because of this). Lastly, they have not updated the furniture or carpets with the merger. So, what you get is a hotel that is starting to fray a little around the edges (it was about time for some cosmetic upgrades anyway) too. Also, because I used to stay so often, I could get the best room for a very reasonable rate. That seems to have changed now that they have been bought/merged. This is still a good hotel (average to slightly above average). It still has some of the feel and flavor of the old \"Watertown\". But it has changed. I would probably come back, out of convenience.

Nice touches include a lot of counterspace in the bathroom to lay out all your stuff, a wooden bench, larger sofa bed, mini-refrigerator and small microwave, and Keurig coffee machine with a selection of coffee and tea pods. Instead of those tiny bottles of shampoo and bar soap that doesn\u2019t dissolve in water, this hotel has liquid dispensers (see photo) which I prefer. The toilet/tub room has a motion sensor that operates the fan, which is very quiet. The hair dryer afixed to the wall also has a built-in night light. The room comes with 2 terry-cloth bathrobes of the kind you find in hotels (thick and heavy so you won\u2019t be tempted to stick one in your bag on the way out). The king bed was high quality with good quality linens and comforter. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel doesn\u2019t provide a free breakfast. Instead, they have a Starbucks-like coffee boutique with pastries and light food. It\u2019s open until 2pm, after which the management puts out reasonable quality free coffee and mini-cupcakes in the lobby. The free parking is underground and the spaces are tight. We had rented a compact car with this in mind and it worked out well. Security is good; a key card is required to access the garage and to operate the elevator.

I've been staying here for almost ten years now, at least 20 nights a year and up until this year, I'd never stay anywhere else. But unfortunately, the hotel was purchased by Pineapple Hospitality and it's not the same. The bad. First, there is no more free breakfast, there's a crummy little \"cafe\" that serves the basics, but if you want something other than Starbucks coffee, go across the street. Even the Starbucks isn't free until 2:00 in the afternoon. Second, the shampoo. They used to have great Aveda products, but now they have soap/shampoo/conditioner that all smells like a cheap Pina Colada. Take my word on this, YOU HAVE TO BRING YOUR OWN SHAMPOO ETC. The stuff they have is really really bad. If you like a hot shower, you might be disappointed, sometimes the water is almost hot but some mornings just tepid. Not a chance that you could take a hot bath though with what comes out of the tap. Internet can be quite variable. Some days pretty fast, some days painful. I've frequently had to go down to a cafe if I had work to do which required a good fast connection. The good. The staff is generally friendly and the housekeeping staff is the best anywhere.

I booked the Watertown Hotel through a 3rd party site. The rate was a lot cheaper than going through Watertown directly. Most hotel chains price match or \"offer a lowest rate\" type of deal but I did not have the time to do research on this. I needed a hotel, read reviews and just paid. Time was not on my side. The hotel is very new. The decor is modern and clean. Nice king size bed, and a flat screen TV. Large mirrors and many power outlets. Our room was adjacent to the elevator and never at any moment did we hear hallway traffic or noise. The Watertown offers a breakfast buffet which includes all your basic pastries, yogurt and fruit. There are bagels, hard boiled eggs and different types of milk and juice. It is basic and does the job. WIFI is also free. It is unsecured but for checking basic email or news it does the job just fine. The hotel is adjacent to the AVE where there are many places to eat of different ethnic origin and at reasonable prices. Walking to and from the AVE is a few blocks so keep that in mind. If you don't want to walk you may want to consider another hotel. Right across the street is a convenient store that has a good selection of beer and snacks. Husky Stadium is dry so if you want to get your drink on stopping by this store right across the street is a good choice. There is a shuttle but we didn't take advantage of it. My GF and I ended up walking to the AVE and catching the bus to Seattle Center and Downtown. For those who are into bus riding and want to get to downtown just remember 71, 72, and 73. And when you want to come back to the U-District remember to go under Westlake Center and use Bay A. Some people have mentioned issues with the customer service, our contact with customer service desk employees was minimal but they did answer my questions and inquires. If you are going to a UW football game or dropping your college son/daughter to UW I would highly recommend this hotel. There is a walk to the campus but it isn't too bad. At the same time just be aware of your surroundings during the evenings. There are homeless that live on the AVE but if you keep your head on a swivel and are just aware of what is around you then you should have no problem. Also when booking, keep in mind the hotel room taxes. The price that I was quoted from the 3rd party site was over $50 bucks less then what I actually paid. The fine print is there but just keep in mind that the Seattle hotel room taxes when booking any hotel--not just this one.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "san diego", "Title": "\u201cAnother pleasant stay at the Watertown\u201d", "Author": "la811", "ReviewID": "UR117634447", "Content": "This is our 2nd stay at the Watertown and we enjoyed it once again.

However, we had too many negative experiences that have convinced us not to go back, regardless of the free night promotion we received (which they changed on us at the last minute and we had to fight for it). The front desk was one small step up from useless. THREE times we went to see them with what we thought were simple questions and the people working there knew nothing and came right out and said they don't actually work there and were just covering for someone else. Did they offer to take a message? Nope, they just said they didn't know and we would have to come back. When we did find someone who knew what they were talking about, they were unfriendly and dismissive. The front desk seem to be run by over-tired, hungover college students who couldn't care less about the guests. Although the beds weren't horrendous, they do leave much to be desired. The comforters and sheets were either overly starched or really cheap... they were SO noisy with every movement. I was up most of the first night, with every toss and turn of my family. The carts... yes, these sound like a great idea. On our last day there, we planned to reserve an art cart for our kids while we packed up. The evening before I approached the front desk to do this and got the \"I don't work here...they told me I wouldn't have to worry about that carts thing\" so I phoned the front desk first thing in the morning. She said that an art cart was available but it was on the 4th floor and she was by herself and couldn't get it. A few hours later, my husband went out the door to start loading the car up and a cart was sitting outside (who knows how long). This cart looked nothing like it was described. It had a few sheets of construction paper, a few colouring pages printed off the computer and a box of worn out crayons and felts that didn't work. The small paint sets were pretty much empty. Where were the scissors and glue and art supplies? Not there... The trip ended with a miserable student checking us out so we left frustrated and with no intention to go through that again.

The design and atmosphere is contemporary and relaxing. For first timers to Seattle this is a good alternative to more expensive places and there is ample public transit to get to where you want to go. The fact that it is in a working residential area is a little nicer than being downtown. I liked the fact that to get to any floor of the hotel you had to be in possession of a card key. Living in the neighborhood I can add that Roosevelt is a street that is busy most of the time with cars and foot traffic which is good as there are usually people around. Late at night apply the same street smarts you would in any unfamiliar city. Arguably the neighborhood is safer overall than downtown Seattle but it is possible to get into trouble if you aren't paying attention.

This is by far the best value I've found in the Seattle area. I made my reservations online through the hotel's website by using the BEST promo code and ended up with a price that beat other online travel web sites. This is not a high-end upscale hotel but the little touches they provide rival, and beat, some Seattle-area high-end competitors. They do not nickle and dime their guests to death. For example: 1) the secure, underground parking is free; 2) they provide loaner umbrellas at the front door which are needed in the Seattle area--my daughter's friend didn't bring an umbrella so the loaner came in handy; 3) they have a free computer in the lobby that we used to look up movie times at a nearby movie theater; 4) they have themed \"carts\" which are complimentary--we used a spa cart that contained a foot spa, handheld massager, CD player with relaxing music, lotions, shampoos, loofah, etc.; 5) the cookies in the lobby during check-in were delicious; 6) the free breakfast is very good for getting tourists through a morning of sightseeing in the area; 7) they provide a map on their card key holder which was very convenient for sightseeing; and 8) we did not use the free shuttle but that is also a nice touch. Regarding the previous comment about the hotel not being near anything, this hotel is a few blocks off busy 45th and a few blocks away from University Avenue. We were able to walk to the UW, several movie theaters and many restaurants. Our room faced Roosevelt Avenue and we were not bothered by street noise (I don't think it is a very busy street). I prefered the location to a hotel such as the Deca because it is a little bit out of the way. After dinner and a movie we walked back to the hotel around 10 p.m. and felt very safe along the way.

Trudy and Ty were awesome, great people and great advice for the first time tourists. Thanks Trudy and Ty, you made our stay really hassle free and super easy. The great thing is that they have several places to drop you off and you can take an easy walk to most of the touristy stuff. (plus taxis from one end of downtown to the other is around 8 bucks). And you can just arrange for pick-up after you're done. 2. free breakfast, scrambled eggs and a protein (bacon, sausage); yogurt, cereals, granola, free tea and coffee 24/7, breads, muffins, etc. 3. Great value, definitely not as expensive as the downtown hotels 4. Rooms are huge. We stayed in a double queen room on the top floor with a great view of the seattle skyline. 5. and there's a nifty little market across the street for anything you might have forgotten, and i hear the deli sandwiches are good there too. 6. more for the business set (quiet) , but I think families would like this hotel a lot. Con's: 1. nothing really much in the vicinity, just a nice quiet urban neighborhood. 2. I didn't get the really friendly feel you get from the front desk. Some were nice, some just seemed busy and could care less. I did get a lot of help from a few of the girls who were really understanding whenever I changed the shuttle schedule around. And the guy who was so patient giving me driving directions over the phone, thanks! My tip: make sure you plan out you're trip...the concierge service is pretty \"do it yourself\" ^^ 3.

The room was well laid out including a TV that could be rotated from the bedroom to the bathroom/dressing area. The closets opened both to the bedroom and the bath. This is the only hotel we've stayed in where a achohol wipe was placed under the phone and by the TV remote for use by the guest to clean each item. Nice touch. Lighting in the room is inadequate as the hotel uses CFLs that do not provide adequate light, especially at the desk. We used the free wireless internet as we had our laptop with us. Morning continental breakfast was adequate but not overwhelming. Eggs were cold, sausage warm. Didn't use the exercise room but it appeared to hacve three or four machines and maybe six or seven bikes on a rack on the wall, those available to guests for use. During the Summer when the weather is nice, the availability of bikes is a good deal given the fact that the Burke-Gilman bike trail is about five blocks away.

We really enjoyed the Watertown Hotel! It is located north of downtown Seattle and I called the hotel ahead of time to ask about transportation from the airport. They arranged for us to be picked up by car service, and the driver was early and contacted me by cellphone. The car service far exceeded expectations -- we were picked up in a super clean, comfortable, Cadillac SUV with leather interior; the driver was very friendly and capable, and we did not have to wait (he waited for us!). At the hotel, we used the free shuttle service to go downtown on our second day. After that, we rented a car and took advantage of the hotel's free and secure parking garage. We appreciated the neighborhood and walked around a good bit, strolling through the Univ of Wash campus (about 1/4 mile away) and down to Portage Bay. We also shopped at Trader Joe's (2 blocks away) for some easy, fresh takeout to eat in the room. Our first room was average sized, but the vanity area was very large and the room had several nice features. There was a microwave and mini fridge and very nice and spacious custom cabinetry. The bath products are by Aveda, which is a nice touch. We found the bed and pillows to be quite comfortable and everything was very clean. At night, the street outside was quiet and we heard no other noises. During the day, the street was busier, but the noise was not a problem at all. We took advantage of the quick and easy free wireless internet using our iphone and our ipod touch. We also found the staff to be very helpful in recommending walks and places to eat. Our second room was a suite (don't know why they gave us that) and it was HUGE. It was L-shaped with a large spa tub under a window in one corner, and it had a couch, coffee table, and armchair as well as a desk. The vanity area was even bigger than in our first room, and it had the same pretty cabinetry and amenities. Unfortunately, and possibly because of the record heat in Seattle, our second room was not adequately cooled. The a/c worked but was too small for a huge 6th floor room. We tried the free breakfast a few times. It was typical free breakfast fare (cereal, oatmeal, toast, store-bought bagels, juice, milk, etc) with the addition of fresh scrambled eggs (which were fine) and bacon or sausage (which we didn't try). They also had lots of bananas and small cups of yogurt, too. It was nice to have fresh coffee and free breakfast.

Their policy, so they said, was to put us up in the University Inn for the night -- definitely NOT what we wanted, nor what we paid for. The employee was completely useless in finding us an alternative hotel in Seattle. He said that everything was full, and that he was very sorry. The unwritten policy was to pay for our room at another hotel, but of course, he couldn't find one. I asked to speak with a manager. No manager available that Sunday morning. I asked for a computer, and found a room at the Redmond Marriott (decent) in 3 minutes. We stormed out, exhausted and frustrated. The next morning, of course, the manager did not call me. I wasn't called on Monday either. Attempts to reach the hotel by phone only reached their fax machine. I left on my honeymoon, and two weeks later, found a message from the manager on my phone sometime during my trip.

Yes, it is a bit out of the way for the Seattle hot spots in downtown, but that is what makes it extra special. It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action. From the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice. We came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in. We had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped. The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids (5 and 10) stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once. We had a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainier out one side. There is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area. The hotel is VERY secure....front door locked at 10 pm and a room key is needed to access guestroom floors at all times. The FREE parking garage (YES, FREE) is also secured pretty well. The evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold! Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas...all made for a great start-up meal. Just remember to GO EARLY. By 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat. Not many tables! We went at 8:15 and it was very nice. The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all. I think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street. It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc. We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor. That was awesome! There isn't all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of Mamma Melena's up the street (excellent Italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service). The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasn't bad at all. There is even a Trader Joe's market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a TON of money. We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertown's sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible (waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift) and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was \"different\" from what we are used to. It was not bad at all, but it wasn't all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery. My advice, skip it. The staff at the front desk was always gracious and ready to help in anyway they could. We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well. My only complaints: 1) The cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us. We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie (no DVD players in the rooms) but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one. They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms. We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen. Bummer! 2) One elevator of the two was broken during our stay. This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage. 3) There are no \"bellman\" so you do have to move your own luggage. Thankfully, they had two carts sitting by the elevators, but only two. 4) There is no real drop off place in front. It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything. You just have to pull up and get dropped off. At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldn't even pull up in front!!!

Our room faced the street, but we heard no traffic noise. We did hear occasional footsteps above us, however. The cleaning staff did an excellent job daily and the place was immaculate. The hotel has friendly, upbeat staff, who are happy to answer questions. On weekends, freshly baked chocolate chip cookies (the aroma fills the lobby) wait for guests at reception in the afternoon and a big bowl of apples is available. A Happy Hour (free wine and beer plus snacks) starts at 5:30 p.m. on weekdays. A small gym is located on the main floor near the breakfast room. The morning buffet includes fresh fruit, such as sliced oranges, honeydew melon and bananas; three kinds of cereal; baked goods, such as bagels, muffins and small scones; scrambled eggs and bacon or sausage; two kinds of juice; 2 percent and skimmed milk; and coffee and tea. The room is too small, though, to comfortably fit the number of guests who often arrive at the same time. On warm days, it is possible to go to tables outside, but Seattle is rarely warm early in the morning. Free, secure parking is an added bonus. You can simply park the car and take nearby bus transport Downtown or reserve a ride on the hotel's free shuttle (with a tip to the driver). The bus takes about 20 minutes to get downtown. It is an easy walk to the University of Washington and its museums and to shops, restaurants, movie theatres, etc., in the University area. I recommend the Cedars at 4759 Brooklyn Ave. for reasonably priced cuisine from India. The Burke Gilman Trail, for cyclists and pedestrians, stretches for miles about three blocks away from the hotel.

My daughter had to be seen by a doctor at the Seattle Children's hospital. We wanted to stay at a hotel the night before, since her appointment was so early in the morning. She is only a year, and takes a lot of work to get ready in the morning, and coming all the way from Olympia is a long drive so early. I read the reviews prior to booking and decided to go ahead and book a night there. They offer a discounted rate for families that have kids going to or staying at the hospital. I called several hotels and asked them if they had a hospital discount, and while they did it was MUCH more expensive. I was also concerned about safety. I wanted inside rooms, and secure free parking, which is very hard to find in the U area. They had a very secure garage to part in, and the elevator would only take you to the lobby if you don't have a key. You have to have your room key to get to the guest room floors, which I think is just Wondeful!! really makes you feel secure. After we checked in, we went up to our room and we were quite impressed. We love that the closet doors open from the living area, and the bathroom area...so you don't have to tramp naked to the bed/living area, you can access your clothes from the bathroom area. Most hotel's \"closets\" are on the other end of the room from the bathroom. They also provide 2 robes to use while you are there. Their bath products were nice. the tv was pretty cool, they have it on a swiveling/slididng base, and you can actually turn the tv and watch it while you are getting ready in the bathroom. The mirror and sink area are seperate from the shower. For women, this is a plus. We don't have to stand in the steam to put our makeup on, while our husbands/kids are taking a shower. the room was small, but the way it is layed out, we had plenty of room, even with our stroller inside the room. Now here is the best thing. They have these alacartes that you can request, before you arrive and it will be waiting in your room when you get there. They have a Seattle one in all the rooms, but you can request another one. They have artistic ones (that come with things to draw and paint and such) they have a movie watching one, an internet one, where they bring you a laptop and printer, and many many more. The one thing I would suggest to the hotel, is make the full list available on line, and when customers call to book an appointment, let them know about the many carts. But this is minor......We arrived at the hotel to late to request one. (there are certain hours only that you can request a cart)....We didn't realize they had a baby cart, with toys, wipes, takalong bibs, plastic kid spoon and fork, disposable sippie cups...lots of stuff perfect for babies.....and they include several outlet covers, so you can plug up the outlets and not worry about your baby sticking something in them. Well we asked the front desk clerk Jessica who was Wonderful!!! She not only suggested a great little italian place just a few blocks away....she said she would see about getting the baby cart and putting it in our room....even though the hours to request one is closed. She was just so sweet and nice, and gave my daughter a little rubber ducky that she got to keep. All of the staff were so nice and more than willing to bend over backwards for customers. We got there to late to enjoy the wine tasting on weeknights, but I'm sure that would be fun. We did partake in breakfast and I enjoyed it. Some other people commented on the quality of the breakfast, but it's free and it's available for several hours......when you are trying to get a 1 year old up early, and dressed...it's nice to just stroll downstairs and get some breakfast. I have stayed in a lot of hotels over my lifetime, and most continental breakfasts don't have hot food.....they have scrambled eggs and sausages. along with bagels, toast, muffins, scones, fresh fruit, SOY MILK (what hotel offers that?, none...this one is great), milk, OJ (it did taste a little sunny D like, but hey it was still good and nice and cold). Their muffins were really good. They also had yogurt (wonderful for kids, my daughter loves yogurt) and several different cereals....The coffee and tea are available 24/7....so that is a great thing too, though they give you a bag of starbucks coffee and a coffee maker in your room too. Overall this experience was Wonderful!!!!! I am not a really picky person, but I am a clean freak and this place was Spotless. My husband travels a lot and stays in a lot of hotels around the world, nice ones at that...and he can always find some mold or hair or dirt in the bathrooms....I'm telling you, I'm a germaphobe and this plact was SPOTLESS. So spotless, I decided to give my daughter a bath that night before her doctor appt the next day. They even had a bath mat to put down, so she didn't slide around, and it was clean too......The beds were comfy, and the option of 2 different kind of pillows is just awesome!! I usually bring my down pillow everywhere, because I can't sleep with anything else. I forgot to bring it this time, and had no problems, I used one of their synthetic pillows, and it was Great....obviously from nice quality, not a discount store special. The sheets and comforters were nice, and clean! I have never written a review on a hotel before, I'm not usually one to do that unless it's really bad, or really really good. This hotel exceeded all of my expectations. I have never been treated so nicely by staff in all my life...they are just wonderful. I thank Jessica (the night clerk on the 2nd) for bending over backwards and getting my daughter the baby cart. She really enjoyed it and I can't tell you much that was appreciated. The morning staff were just as nice, and just ooed and awed over my daughter, and they were all talking to her and saying hello....she was the center of their attention for a few minutes, and she loved that. the Only thing I would suggest to the hotel, is update their hours of the cart availablility and the wine tasting in all the rooms. I found like 4 different times for all of them, and wasn't sure the real time lol....but that is so minor it's hardly worth mentioning. My daughter unfortunatly has to have surgery next month and we Will be staying at this hotel for a few nights!!!! I would recommend this hotel to ANYONE coming to the area. They even have shuttles to take you to the local attractions and hospitals...though we drove ourself to the hospital, it's nice to know if we didn't want to we could have requested a shuttle to take us there.

The reviewers were spot on in prepping me for the ups and downs of this hotel. I stayed near the Needle when in Seattle last year and had done some exploring then and had figured out the city somewhat, so was curious about staying in the U district and wasn't disappointed with that choice. I agree with another reviewer that it is important to know what you're doing if you're going to stay near the U vs. downtown or Queen Anne. But the hotel has a shuttle service with very accommodating and helpful drivers, it's easy to use and readily available, as is their car service which you can reserve for rides to and from the airport. I used their car service for a one day conference in Bellevue and was pleased with how that worked out. The hotel also can call cabs for you if it's not during shuttle hours, and they come right away and are helpful too. The front desk staff was pretty good, helpful and friendly. Every once in a while I asked a question that confused them, but there was someone else to ask and they did their best to make sure I had correct answers to my questions. Fitness room was adequate - heck, Seattle has so many outdoor fitness options, including bicycles and helmets to borrow at the hotel - so you don't have to settle for the fitness room as the only option. Breakfast was adequate as well, more than ample choices and it was decent and available over several hours which was nice. Breakfast and happy hour with wine and beer and little snacks on the weeknights were included with the room price. There are plenty of other hotels in Seattle in higher price ranges that don't offer nearly as much as this place does. The rooms are pretty nice, a little on the small side (at least the studio I had was a little small, but you're not in the room that much), but they seem European in feeling, with windows that open and very clean and well appointed, lots of nice pillows and modern fixtures and bathrobes and decent bath products. The A La Carte option is also fun, and a nice free feature. AAA discount offers decent rates. And on the last night, since housekeeping forgot to make up my room, the front desk made a special deal for me to make up for that disappointment, which was greatly appreciated. It is a wonderful selling point to have that kind of service which is more than willing to go out of their way when it's their oversight causing a guest disappointment.

Overall, we were very impressed with the quality of the amenities of the hotel and the friendliness of the staff. The location, however, was fairly far from the downtown tourist hub. Reservation Process We were part of a group reservation for the beginning of our trip so I made my reservation directly through the hotel. The person taking our reservation was very helpful and courteous. When I asked what the rate would be to extend our stay past the room block, she quoted a reasonable rate. I told her that I was going to first check if there was anything around that rate downtown and get back to her. She strongly encouraged me to do so soon since they were filly up quickly. When I looked online, everything downtown was 1.5 to 2 times pricier than the Watertown, so we decided to stay here. The reservation agent also gave us the name of a town car service we could use for airport transfers. The service was cheaper than taking a taxi. Rooms The rooms were very modern and pretty spacious. The corner of the room had floor to ceiling windows. No special view but allowed for a lot of light. The bathroom had a separate vanity area from the shower/toilet area which made getting ready easy. I also liked that the TV was on a swivel and we could watch the tv from the bath while getting ready in the morning. We had 2 queen beds that were the most comfortable mattress I have ever slept on before. I really liked that they color coded their pillows (white were hypoallergenic and cream were feather). The maid service was attentive enough to notice that I had a definite preference for hypoallergenic and made the bed up accordingly each day. The bath products were Aveda. I was disappointed that we were only given shampoo, bath bar and lotion- I was counting on conditioner which we did not get. I did not make use of the cart service (a unique amenity) but had a colleague who ordered the Spa Cart and loved it! I wish I had known about it before checking in and I would have reserved the Sweet Dreams cart (there are more carts available than just those listed on their web site). The rooms also had a mini-fridge (empty) and microwave so you could grab something lite from a nearby store for a snack. Breakfast was remarkably good for a free service although the juice glasses could have doubled as shot glasses (they were tiny). We took advantage of the the free happy hour one 2 nights and liked mingling with other guests. We did not make use of the bicycles but saw many that did. The rooms were very clean (although my carpet seemed to have a stain) and would pass a white glove test for dust. Service The staff were always very pleasant and quick to acknowledge me when I was around. They would ask me if I needed assistance even before I got a chance to ask. We asked for advice on directions and restaurant recommendations several times. Shuttle Service The drivers were very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. My one complaint with this service is that it fills up very quickly. We had to pre-plan all of our trips downtown and had to plan based on when a spot was open on the shuttle. It is not available on an ad hoc request basis as I thought it might be. We also had to share with the sister property at University Inn, which competed for seats. Location The biggest drawback for me was the location of the hotel. If you are not a fan of walking a lot, then the location can seem like it is in the middle of nowhere. We walked about a mile away to a local neighborhood area for some eclectic restaurant fare. The University is about a 20 minute walk and the downtown area requires a 20 minute shuttle ride (depending on traffic).

After flying a redeye all the way from Tampa FL and arriving at the hotel at 3 AM we were told by the night auditor that he had cancelled our reservation but could put us in a room, whatever at this point but he put us in a room with 2 double beds, not the king we had guaranteed. After going down to the desk again and pursuing it we were finally shown to a very nice suite which was an upgrade over our original room. He couldn't figure out how to correct the rate but assured me it would be taken care of by the manager in the morning. Sure enough the next morning I spoke with the day manager and was assured it would be taken care of. After enjoying the breakfast provided and a day of sightseeing in Seattle, we returned to find the room had not been cleaned. Once again, I contacted the front desk and after an apologie the room was cleaned, sort of, they made the bed and changed the towels but did not vacuum or even give us fresh coffee for the coffee maker. The next morning at checkout our bill was indeed corrected to the proper rate. I asked the desk clerk to call us a cab to take us to the port and instead they called a limosine service they use. The price was only $25 so I didn't complain but it wasn't what I asked for. Overall, we found the hotel average at best. The Avida products and furnishings provided a nice touch and the free shuttle downtown was convenient but the problems we had though somewhat resolved don't allow me give a better review. NO traveler at 3AM who has guaranteed a room should EVER have to worry that there room isn't available after it has been paid for. There is NO excuse for that. The proper way to have handled it after holding us up would have been to comp the room for that night , especially after it wasn't even cleaned the next day.

This due to location as we needed to go to the zoo for daughter . Watertown is about 5 minutes away driving from zoo. Downtown is actually close too. While PP was a business like modern classic, Watertown was a Hip modern. Even the room key jacket is a clever folded map of Seattle. The hotel itself is new and very nice. Things i did not like, although not a big minus: - Nice floor to ceiling glass window walls did not have a liner curtain but only the thick light blocking one. Although one assumes that it is dark if looked from outside, not confy to walk in undies with curtains up unless u r a stripper or in good shape( I am neither). Specially since we are facing a construction site and lots of workers. Also our room did not have much outside lighting so had to have lights on most of the time. - Construction noise/view was bad during day. But this seems to be common sight in Seattle as we had the same with PanPacific room. - My wife felt the bed was a bit on the soft side for her likings. I guess this was compared to PP. - Coming from the PP awesome bathroom, Watertown's was small and no separate glass shower stall. The outstanding plus: - Parking underground hotel is free/great, elevator connects to lobby and room. - Well stocked free breakfast, although nothing out of the ordinary. Compares to a hampton inn ones. Other observations: - Wifi would not connect even though it sees the net( No, I am not network illiterate). Used the provided wired lan. No prob. - Did not use any of the amenities, which looked very very good. Overall, can't go wrong with this hotel. Will be happy to stay again here.

The people on staff, while young, were very friendly and helpful. There's nothing extra-ordinary about the hotel itself, but I think what really sold me in the first place were the unique amenities. I LOVE that they had bikes and helmets for loan that were in excellent condition. The trail is only a few blocks from the hotel, and we took advantage of a rare sunny winter day to bike through UW and down to the Gasworks Park. The second amenity that we loved were the ala carts. I requested the spa cart which came with a CD player and relaxing CD, bath products, etc. I think this is an ingenious idea to personalize a hotel stay as there are various carts to choose from. Third, just little touches like free secured parking, aveda bath products, bath robes, fresh cookies in the lobby, wine tastings, a general store with Trader Joe's snacks, a recycle bin in the room, a map built into your room key holder. The room itself was very clean, and while it had a nautical theme, the decor was not gaudy or tasteless. The setup of the room was smartly designed with appliances tucked in with the clothing closet. My only complaints are that the tub was pretty small, the breakfast was so-so, and the lights around the vanity were fluorescent and therefore made doing makeup and hair difficult. I appreciate that the hotel is striving to be \"green\"-- kudos-- but splurge on the vanity lights please. The location was convenient because we had our own car, but I could see getting around to be a bit difficult if you had business downtown to attend to every day.

Very open and comfortable. - Very clean - Courteous staff - Simple, modern furnishings with a bit of nautical flair. It has a nice urban feel, without being aggressively modern and cold (I'm looking at you, \"W Hotel\"). - Nice, central location close to I-5, downtown, Greenlake, UW, the zoo, etc. - Themed complimentary carts are a cute idea - Free parking - Not quite as expensive as most Seattle downtown and upscale hotels - Very quiet. Seems like they have good sound-proofing to keep the noise of the city out. Things we didn't like: - Additional $10 for each person (beyond the first) seems like an odd pricing structure. It's only $10, but that is somewhat irritating when you are already paying a a fairly high rate + state tax + hotel tax. If you're traveling as a family, this is going to get very expensive. - Parking garage might be a bit difficult to maneuverer around in when it's crowded - Views from most rooms are not particularly fabulous. I imagine there's a couple that will give you a nice view of Downtown, but everything else tends to face nondescript neighborhoods and office buildings. And, that's really my only negatives.

The Watertown hotel has great bells and whistles, but first let's look at the basics: * Room size and layout - We had a suite--no complaints there. I especially liked having 2 sinks, one across from the bed and one next to the bathroom door. * Bed comfort - Excellent with a nice pillowtop mattress. * Cleanliness - Some hairs left behind from previous guest, but otherwise good. * Helpfulness of staff - Quite good. * Quietness - Here's where they fall down. We heard lots of noise from the room above. Very easy to hear footsteps above you. However, they appear to have double-paned windows, and you can't hear much noise from outside. On the weekend, there were a lot of teenagers talking noisily in the hallway, but the halls were quiet at all other times. * Temperature control - A bit difficult. The thermostat says high heat, low heat, high cool, low cool and fan only. Unlike a thermostat where you can set the temperature, it was challenging to get this room to stay at a comfortable temperature. * Water pressure in shower - mediocre but adequate. * Refrigerator - Tiny box fridge. * Free internet service with ethernet cable provided. * Free underground garage parking. Garage moderately difficult to maneuver in. Always found a parking space. To sum up the basics, they were average to above average, but definitely not excellent. There are other features, however, that further improve the quality of one's stay here: * Instead of nickel and diming you like a hotel that charges $3 to $6 for a small bottle of water, there is no bottle of water in the room. Instead, they filter the water for you in the room! * Free breakfast which my partner enjoyed (Foods listed in a previous review.) * Free happy hour wine tasting * Washing machine and dryer on every floor--free! (But be sure to take all your clothes out of the washer or dryer by 10 pm, or they'll get locked in the laundry closet. But if they do, a staff member will come upstairs and lock it for you.) * Their \"ala cart\" program. You can request one of a dozen or so carts. For example, their art cart has art supplies; their games card has board games, playing cards and music; and their spa cart has items including a hand held massager and aroma therapy. * Their gym is tiny but functional, and unlike other hotel gyms I've seen, this one lends you bicycles you can ride on the nearby Burke-Gilman trail. Another thing I love about this hotel is the location, in walking distance from many restaurants, Trader Joes, Half Price Books, and much more. As a vegan, I especially enjoy three of the restaurants in walking distance--Chaco Canyon Cafe (vegetarian, half raw foods), Araya's (vegan Thai), and Bombay Grill (Indian Food--not vegetarian, but vegetarian- and vegan-friendly.)

The rooms are very comfortable and included a small refrigerator, microwave, room safe, and ample drawer space for all your stuff. Must use your room key to get above the lobby entrance.

Going back next year, will go back to the Watertown. Good place for business visitor, families, and groups. There were at least two women's volleyball teams staying there. Things I can recommend doing in Seattle: Sightseeing tour of the city to get your bearings. Go to the Space Needle, but for the best view of the city, pay $3, go to the top of the Columbia Center at 5th and Columbia. Pike Place Market-could go every day for food, people watching and street musicians. Walk about the waterfront. Take a short cruise around the harbor. Drive about 30 minutes away from Seattle and see Snoqualmie Falls. Took a 25-minute seaplane city tour with Kenmore Air from Lake Union area. UNBELIEVABLE.

We like to stay in the University District because it is convenient to get to most of the rest of the city from there. The last few times we have stayed at the Hotel Deca (previously the Best Western University) but this year we had to find an alternative because Deca's prices have gone up significantly. We chose the Watertown based on location (near University Avenue) and price ($149/US night through Expedia). The positive reviews on TripAdvisor also helped, and we were not disappointed. We had an excellent experience at this hotel. Our room was beautifully designed, clean, and well-maintained. It was also quiet even though it faced the street. The staff were very friendly, well-informed, and willing to help with whatever they could. The free breakfast was fresh and substantial, and we really appreciated the free 24-hour tea and coffee service. The free parking was also a huge bonus (we have stayed at downtown Seattle hotels where the parking was at minimum $20/day in an outdoor, unsecured parking lot; the Watertown's lot is underground and has a security gate). Some reviews on TripAdvisor are unsure about the University District's safety; while there are some scary-looking people on the street, we have never had any problems walking around there, even at night, as long as you pay attention to your surroundings. The hotel location is very convenient to the I-5 highway, which runs north and south through the Seattle area. If you don't want to drive, you can get a bus to pretty much anywhere in Seattle from University Ave. which is three blocks away. The hotel also runs a shuttle van which will take you for free to downtown, nearby shopping, and the University of Washington campus. We took the van to Seattle Center, planning to go to a baseball game at Safeco Field that evening, and were told by the friendly van driver that although the van did not usually run as late as when the game would end, we should still call the hotel that evening; if there were other passengers wanting a ride around the same time, they would add a run to pick us up.

Checkin was quick and easy, almost a little too casual for a hotel. The checkin counter looks like one in a dentist's office -- very casual. Loved the free parking in a very safe underground garage -- you can only access with your hotel key. Feels just like living in your own apartment!

Our room, like the property itself, was clean and well looked after. The room had a comfortable King bed, basic washroom, tiny fridge and a small television set.

There is free, secured parking, located under the hotel for hotel guests, but the parking stalls are tiny and the ceiling only six feet, six inches high, so larger vehicles may have problems parking.

We only knew about it because our son does not live far from here. The hotel was totally booked during this time period because so many people were without power. The front desk people were overwhelmed because of all the calls, etc. but they handled it very well. The rooms are good size, the bathrooms are very nice. It is done rather modern style - but not cold. The restaurant downstairs does mainly appetizer type food, but the soups/salads, etc. are very tasty.

Yes, if my power went out. But if I were a tourist coming here to Seattle for the first time? No. This hotel is a distance from downtown Seattle - 10 minutes by car when traffic is good.

No. If you have a child or relative that is going to the University of Washington and you are here to see them and be involved in their activities - this is the perfect place for you.

Also, the people above us must have had children that were busy - they hit the floor at 6AM and it sounded like floor hockey above us for the next 2 hours until they took them for breakfast. If you aren't on one of the top floors looking south - you look at a busy street. This area is an interesting area of Seattle. We love it and have bought a condo in this area where we plan to eventually move. However, it is an area of transition - it is not a typical area of Seattle.

Stayed in the Watertown Hotel after reading good reviews on Tripadvsor. So glad we did! The room was lovely - big, beautifully furnished and equipped (massive bed, airconditioned, great bathroom, microwave- complete with popcorn, starbucks coffee provided etc etc) and the hotel was clean and smart. We turned up for the complimentary breakfast, thinking it would be a curled up danish and lukewarm coffee to find that there was a choice of juices, cereals, bagels, danishes, eggs, bacon, sausages, yoghurts, and loads more). The hotel provided free, secure parking, a laundry, free loan of bikes, a gym and best of all, complimentary carts. Order them when you book or arrive and a cart will be delivered to your room. We borrowed the relaxation cart (lovely spa products - body lotion, bath salts etc, a food spa, massage machine, CD player and relaxing cd's) and the internet cart (computer and printer), but there were loads more on offer - a games cart (lots of board games), kids cart (plug socket covers, kids bath toys etc), grumpy cart (not sure what was on this) night night cart (aromatherapy products and white noise machine) to name a few. Although the hotel is a bus ride out of Seattle's centre, it was still a great location, in the middle of the University district. There were lots of good bars & restaurants just a block away. The hotel provides a free shuttle service downtown and it's also on main bus routes. We reckoned this was one of the best hotels we'd ever stayed in when you considered the location, room, standard of breakfast, service etc. Didn't want to leave & would definately stay there if we ever visit Seattle.", "Date": "August 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "NCjohnboy", "ReviewID": "UR5593308", "Content": "What an enjoyable stay.

The breakfast (eggs and bacon, yogurt, fruit, yummy scones that are cookie-like, juices), complimentary wine tasting 5pm-9pm, Hershey's chocolates in the rooms are nice touches. There's a minimart type area in the lobby if you need some quick snacks. I've heard good things about the free carts (art, relaxing, computer or movie) too, but haven't done that yet. Unlike some downtown Seattle hotels (Watertown is not in downtown but near University of Washington), parking is free. Potential downsides - checkout, if you want a receipt when you leave, is at the counter only. Shuttle to downtown stops at 7pm and is only hourly, which may not be often enough if you want to sightsee or shop downtown.

We left at 7am in the morning and when we returned at 3pm I was surprised to see a maid's cart on the floor. I didn't think much of it until we went in our room and saw that the room wasn't made up. We were in town for a wedding that was starting in 2 hours, so we picked up a couple towels from the floor and started getting ready. While I was in the shower housekeeping stopped by. My husband explained that we were getting ready and to come back after 4pm. A few minutes later we got a call from the front desk saying that if we didn't get our room cleaned right then that it wouldn't be cleaned at all. Finally the front desk said that the room would be made up after 6pm. That was fine with us, since we were going to be out until late in the evening. To our surprise at 4pm housekeeping showed up again. We were almost ready, so told them to come back in 10 minutes and we would be gone. Two minutes later the front desk called and said that the maid had left and that our room would not be cleaned up. The conversation went back and forth with the front desk. Even at a Motel 6 I expect to have my room made up. In the end as we were leaving I gave the front desk my blackberry number and told them to have the manager call me if they were unable to get our room cleaned. The clerk at the front desk (who was giving us some serious attitude) got off the phone (with whom appeared to be the offsite manager) and announced that she was going to clean our room and to not exepct much since she wasn't a trained housekeeper. We returned to a room that appeared to be cleaned, except for that there were no bath towels in the room and instead we were left with 5 bath mats! Maybe that was the clerk's way of getting even with us. The front desk appeared to be staffed by college students and not once between Thursday and Sunday did we see a manager or someone who appeared over 25 years old. I really question who is in charge here. I shouldn't have to argue with a clerk over whether my room is going to be cleaned, especially when I was gone for 8 hours during the day. I did contact the manager when I returned home. They did say that my experience should not have happened. They offered me $20 off a future stay. No thank you. I'd rather stay some place where I can be assured of clean towels and no attitude! If everything is going well and you have low expectations, I think the Watertown is a fine place to stay.

If you're a serious biker, I'd call ahead and make sure there are some good ones available. - Free \"carts\" of various entertainments were available.

And don't bother paying for that city view. Ours was obstructed by neighboring buildings. -- Breakfast is merely weak Starbucks coffee, some boiled eggs and a lot of sugar and bread. Go down to the Portage Bay Cafe instead and buy a remarkable breakfast. -- The shuttle service that supposedly makes several downtown stops made just one, and the latest pickup back to the hotel is 7:30 p.m. -- The wine tasting had an expansive list -- but it was limited to two tastings (each of which was about three sips). No cheese or bread was offered with the tastings. -- There is no room service, and no food at the restaurant on weekends. The week night menu is very limited. However, the nearby Portage Bay Cafe is excellent! However, it closes at 3 p.m. and there's nothing decent within walking distance.

Very spacious and well-appointed, including an enormous mirror. I thought the bathroom vanity area was nice, but the actual water closet (toilet and tub/shower) was completely neglected by the designers. The toilet and the tub were on top of each other in this tiny room. Although clean, this tiny room had no shower tiles and no color. I have been in hospital restrooms nicer than this area. It was cramped and sterile. The room had three bath towels, but only one washcloth and two handtowels which seemed a little parsimonious. The Aveda products are always a nice touch. Common areas: Very tastefully done. Clean and inviting. The hotel has free internet access which was convenient to print out our boarding pass. Fitness area was nice, but very small. Housekeeping: No complaints. Continental breakfast: Needs some work. The french toast was cold and spongy and the pastries far from fresh. The cereal was mislabeled and the milk and orange juice were not kept on ice or cool. Better off getting a warm $6 breakfast at the IHOP a block and a half down from the hotel.

For instance, we asked for a map of the area because we intended to take out their free rental bikes (which was a nice amenity). They did not have a map of the area to give to us. It did not appear to be that they ran out of maps, it simply appeared that the hotel simply never contemplated getting a map of the area for their guests.

To be fair, they did tell us how to get there, but it would have been nice to have had a map. On the other hand, the front desk quickly arranged for a Town Car to pick us up for the airport which was appreciated. I have to agree with the prior reviewer: there is a lackadaisical approach to the front desk staff. They are nice, but they really don't seem to be well-trained in professionalism or knowledge of the area. Perhaps, I would not be so critical of the service and the food if the room was cheaper.
