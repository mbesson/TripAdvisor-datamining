{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Ghost hotel This is a stunning hotel, but eerily deserted. We were the only guests at the time, which wouldn't have bothered us, but we felt like we were imposing on the staff. For example, there are no tvs in the room, so we went to watch the news in the communal tv room for 1/2 hour, the staff made a big performance about having to leave the room...it is a guest tv room!!! They were always in there...in the end its just not worth disturbing them. Similarly, when we checked in, we asked if we could pay extra to have an ocean view room...we were the only guests at the hotel, and quite happy to pay more, but the staff said no. The restaurant was overpriced with a very limited menu (3 choice of mains). The views are lovely, the pool is nice but if you want a beautiful isolated hotel, there are many better ones in Bali to visit...see my reveiew of Gajah Minah in Balian, or go to a hotel in Amed.I work in the travel industry and spend 200+ nights in hotels per year, this was not one of the better nights.", "Date": "Nov 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR354071444", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "miraball"}, {"Content": "Strongly recommend My husband and i spent 4 days and 3 nights of our honeymoon at Jepun Bali and we enjoyed every minute of it (Dec 2004). We took the private villa (there's only 2 of those). It cost about USD110 a night. But it was worth it as we had a private pool all to ourselves. (For USD 150 a night, we were in Ubud later in our trip and just had a normal superior room)However, the journey to Jepun Bali was quite long - about 4 hours. And the last 2 hours was up and down hills and winding roads - i was a bit travel sick.We came during the peak Xmas season but the hotel was virtually deserted (8 other guests). (We wondered if they were making money). Maybe because we went there just 2 days after the Acheh tsunami.The rooms were simple yet tastefully decorated i thought. Rooms were clean and the bed was wonderful. There's a gazebo and the room opens out to the sea - with a beach view and coconut trees. We chose breakfast in bed and it was good. Staff was friendly. We received a honeymooner cake but we ate a bit of it only and gave the rest to the hotel workers. We did have a dinner in the restaurant - rather pricey though. It's a good place for honeymooners - quiet and secluded. Otherwise there wasn't much to do - we thought of sailing in an outrigger canoe but they said the sea was rough (monsoon), there was the black beach which one could take long walks = again, rough seas so you are discouraged from swimming. There's a small library and a small VCD collection- nothing to shout about. We also had a spa treatment but that was pretty pricey (i can't remember how much). We did sidetrips to Gilgit waterfalls and Lovina beach. Apparently, U can hike up a nearby mountain or go scuba diving in Tulamben.i would strongly recommend this place", "Date": "Sep 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR762782924", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297699-d522589-r6052630-Jepun_Bali_Resort-Singaraja_Bali.html", "HotelID": "522589", "Price": "$95"}}
