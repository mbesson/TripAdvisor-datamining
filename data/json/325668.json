They also demanded a 20 euro deposit from each person before we could have breakfast. Eventually they let us have two of our rooms so that all 50 of us could get changed and freshen up - when really we wanted a sleep and a shower. When we got our room the bathroom decor was hideous as if it were from the 70's. On top of this the room stank of cigarettes when it had been clearly stated on my friend's health from that we was asthmatic - this information had been sent to the hotels prior to our stay. We also found the staff unfriendly and unhelpful. A terrible hotel in such a lovely city.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cI will be back!\u201d", "Author": "katarina5358", "ReviewID": "UR117593213", "Content": "Stopped for 4 days in August, 2011.

There was a strange smell in the corridor. On check out I was asked to pay for the internet that was very slow and not really useful. There was no writing desk in the room.

It's really close to the Adenaurplatz U-Bahn station and there are some restaurants close to it. Despite its great location, the hotel fares are not exorbitant. For a room with shower and toilet facilities I paid 49 euros (one night). Including breakfast, which was pretty good, by the way. My room was tidy and clean. It was simple, but I don't have any problems with that. For me, as long as the room is comfortable, clean and the hotel is in a nice neighbourhood, I'm OK. The TV was tiny but, again, that's fine by me, since I only used the room to shower and sleep. When I got to the hotel, before the check in time, my room was note ready yet, but I could left my backpack at the reception. There were 3 receptionists during my stay there and they all spoke English (one of them, not so fluently). All of them were really nice and helpful! From the Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport you can take the X7 or the 171 bus to the RUDOW U-bahn station and then go all the way to Adenauerplatz on the line 7. Not so sure it would be a good idea to do this late at night if you're a woman travelling by yourself - I didn't. The reson i say this is because the whole journey takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour.

It was clean and basic. High ceilings, typical of german living. The buffet breakfast was extremely good and you could have as much as you wanted. The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel is at the bottom end of K'dam, with Adenaurplatz underground and bus stop only a few minutes walk to take you to the centre of Berlin near Zoologischer Garden. The transport system is easy to use, just remember to activate your rail /travelcard! The fact you could use whatever form of transport with your card is brilliant. I would use this hotel again.

The breakfast was also good and the location is good, right by Adenaeurplatz U-Bahn. But this place is a middle ground between a hostel and a hotel. The double bed was actually two twins pushed together with two seperate, really thin blankets....in 2 degree weather in November! The furniture was a bit like college dorm furniture. I thought the bathroom was ok until I took a shower one morning and the water was freezing. I complained and the lady at the reception desk clearly didn't care. Also, their \"left luggage\" doesn't seem very safe to me, it's just left in the main reception area.

This was not a problem for us and it was always kept clean with fresh towels daily. Our room was at the back overlooking a courtyard and was very quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and offered a large choice. We found the staff most helpful. The hotel is located close to the u-bahn and so access to all parts of the city is good.

We were forced to pay in full for the four nights in advance. When I reluctantly paid, I was told I could expect my money back if I were not going to stay. After the first, sleepless, night we asked for a better room or our money back. We were told we could pay for a better one, or we could leave but could expect no money back. The morning shift denied the promises of the previous evening, and claimed a management policy of no refunds. Incredibly hostile attitude - no customer service.
