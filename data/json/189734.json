As a country dweller who often travels to London on business, I am always keen to find a reasonably priced hotel that can offer me a quiet night's sleep. This establishment delivered. Upon arrival I was welcomed by Giovanni who was very professional and welcoming. I was offered a quiet room in the 'new block' which is accessed via a separate entrance a couple of doors down the same street. If you are looking for a quiet night, then the 'new block' is the insider tip! Further, as this section has only recently been opened, the rooms a fresh and very nicely decorated. The room I stayed in also benefitted from a pleasant and functional bathroom, with an excellent shower cubicle. Breakfast is served in the basement of the main building. The breakfast is a basic continental breakfast with cereals, toast and hard boiled eggs on offer - adequate to set one up for the morning, but nothing to get too excited about.

I complained at the front desk 3 consecutive days before they moved me to a newly renovated room. This hotel has two types of rooms, the first type being old, full of mold, dirty, dusty and ridden with fleas. Honestly the most horrible place to stay. The second type of room they have a decent, worth a four star rating, but it's a gamble you'll have to take if you choose to stay there. The breakfast menu was \"Boiled eggs and toast\". Honestly!!! My colleague dared to try their boiled eggs, and spent the rest of his day with cramps! I couldn't bring myself to trying the eggs. Overall, it's a Terrible experience.

The hotel is a 5 minute walk from Kingscross rail station, across a busy road. Made from knocking 3-4 Victoria terraces together and then trying to squeeze in as many rooms as possible, this has the effect of creating a rabbit warren of corridors, strange angles, stairs and at least 6 fire doors before you get to your room. My room 123 and my colleagues room 122 could only be described as tiny squalid dumps, decor that looks like it has not been changed since 1978, the overpowering smell of dust won its fight with the sickening smell of dampness, the old worn out double bed, carpets and scruffy \"Norman Bates\" bathroom made my skin crawl, I slept in my clothes and used the shower once. Walls where so thin that the young lady next door who obviously was booking the room by the hour, kept me awake until the early hours with the same noises for each of her \"friends\" 10 out of 10 for consistency. Breakfast is served in the basement cafe style room, I say breakfast, let me explain, all it is is a croissant, toast and jam or the chefs special \"a boild egg\" needless to say we gave up after I ate one of the eggs and spent the rest of the day in the toilet. After 3 days of hell and daily complaints, they managed to find us some of the new rooms, they where clean, new, small but twice the size of the old rooms.

Who on God's Earth gave this cess-pit a 4 star rating? They should be sued for mis-representation and Comfort Inn should hang their head in shame. I stayed at the Comfort Inn, King's Cross as it is close to the Eurostar terminal and I had an early train the following morning. I use a wheelchair and I pre-notified of my requirement. On arrival, the hotel is up 3 steps. Only shallow steps but the hotel does not even own a cheap ramp. My wife struggled and bumped me up the steps. Staff watched. Staff were polite but spoke poor English. They were apologetic and looked embarrassed - so they should be. My room was on the ground floor but the room entrance was sandwiched between two sets of firedoors so it took lots of lifting and manouvering to turn 90 degrees into the room. Well, I call it a room, it was a box. Possibly the smallest box I have ever stayed in. And as for the bathroom, I could not even get through the door. Being ground floor it was at pavement level. If the cheap and uncomfortable mattress was not enough to keep you awake, then the street light outside and the ability to hear every passer by was. And even if you managed to sleep through all that, then the filthy, flea-bitten carpet will give you nightmares.

I checked into the comfort inn Kings Cross, for a single nights stay during the hot September period, for an evening out with friends in central London. The 2nd floor room overlooking the Kings Cross station end was very basic and small just enough space to swing a very small cat. The bed / mattress itself was old and squeaking metal framed bunk bed and generally very tired not comfortable in any sense. Bathroom was adequate at the price range and surprising cleaner than the room itself. After a night out and having returned to the hotel at approx midnight, having gone to the 2nd floor, I was shocked at what i saw whilst rummaging around all my pockets looking for the room key, a small field mouse running around in the corridor which then ran back and forth from within a linen cabinet and into and back out of another room, not sure if it was occupied by anyone. It seemed that the doors to all the rooms had gaps along the bottom of approx 2 inches from the ground letting in loads of light from the corridor and in the case of the Comfort Inn Kings Cross, mice too. Having been disgusted at this sight of the mouse, i went to complain to the night concierge about the uninvited guests; he advised he would let the manager know in the morning. Not getting any assistance from the chap at reception, I simply went back to the room, rolled up a towel and stuffed it under the door to stop the light and any mice making there way into my room and had an extremely unconformable nights sleep in what could only have been a flee infected bed.

It's close to King's Cross, the trains and shops. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful at all times and have absolutely no complaints about them at all. Otherwise my own review echoes those of many others regarding this hotel. I am well aware that London hotel rooms are often smaller than in other parts of the country and more expensive. If I've understood it correctly, the star rating system is not based necessarily on appearance or ambience, but on whether the hotel has lifts/air con etc. Nev ertheless, when you read that the hotel is given a four-star rating, you expect a lot better, particularly as it's not a cheap place to stay. The overall look of the hotel is shabby - with many carpets in need of replacing. They DO have a lift, but the corridors are so narrow and there are still a few doors to negotiate that taking your suitcases to your room is something of an obstacle course (elderly people beware and get some help with them). Our room was VERY small and only OK for one night. Several nights in the room would have driven us nuts. The walls and ceilings are thin and you can CONSTANTLY hear people walking around at all times above you. And in a four-star hotel I do NOT expect to be woken up at 4 O'clock in the morning by the dulcet sounds of two people enjoying each other and the accompanying squeaky bed! The next morning we had to rise early and I was shattered. Breakfast was included. The breakfast is also not what we expected of a four-star hotel. You sit in a basement room with no window. Coffee was out of a machine and pretty tasteless - we took one sip and left the rest. The toast, jams and cheeses were not that great either. Considering there are so many good alternatives in the area we think they should get their act together here, or just not offer breakfast at all. We have just stayed in a tiny B&B in Edinburgh. Free WiFi was on offer and in many much smaller places we stayed too - so why not here? And when you are rated four star as well. So my overall verdict is very poor.

There was hardly water running out of the shower. There were no shower caps (so too bad if you had forgotten to bring your own) and the water was not hot at all.

Secondly me and my family had booked a room on the 1st floor not knowing there were suites available. Thirdly the lifts were very small and claustrophobic meaning that more than 3 people it could not hold so most of the time we had to squash to make room for other people. And by the way it was very slow! The hallway taking us to our room was very narrow and it was impossible to walk through if you had a big luggage. To open the room the electric cards needed did not work most of the time and it would take hours to enter. Once we asked if they had spare keys and they actually said that they had lost them! And now for the Grand finale Our \"room\" that could not be called a normal room considering it was at the basement floor, with two double beds stuffed in, dirty duvets full of dust and a minuscule wardrobe where there was no space to hang your clothes! The bathroom, and now, this is the most shocking bit.. it had a big step at the front where you had to be careful not to trip into, towels were not changed so we were forced to use the same towels for 3 days, the sink was very low and uncomfortable, the shower was put at an angle of the bathroom meaning it was very narrow and you actually could not move in it, it always leaked even when you closed the water so it was desperate in need of repair and the temperature handle would NOT work so you would waste half of your time fiddling with it hoping hot water would come out but nothing! So we were forced to freeze to death. The windows were the most negative part of all, they did not open meaning your room would not be aired and so remained stuffy and hot also because the air conditioning did not work nicely and made a squeaky sound, the view considering we were at the basement was TERRIBLE you could see people walking by and they could see you which implies there were no curtains to hide yourself from for a bit of privacy. Also the bad thing about this hotel is that if you complained to the staff about the lack of hygiene and wanting to change a room this is not possible and not because there are not enough rooms free (half of the hotel was empty) but because they did not want to, so we had a hard time with them too who were always unpolite and unfriendly.

There were also various wires coming out the wall connected to a transformer which had been screwed to the bedroom wall. It turns out this was for the shower pump which screamed like a banshee when you turned it on. The buffet breakfast was in a windowless room in the basement. Basic offering with no expense spent on the catering. Crossiants had not seen the oven, being cold and hard. Ham looked very odd. Yoghurts were extremely cheap and nasty.

I'll break it down. 1. The Rooms. They were nice. They've been updated since a few of the pictures from reviewers were posted. Each room has a flat screen tv i'd say it was a 26 inchs. The rooms were not extremely large but ours was a pretty good size. 2. The Bathrooms. Very spacious. The shower was roomy and had recently been redone. Everything was very clean no mold or gunk. The water was always hot. 3. The Maids. Everyday our room was cleaned. She took out the garbage, made our beds and put out new towels. They say if you hang them up then they won't take them in order to save water but they did anyways. Oh Well it's always nice to have clean ones. They provide a dispincer full of soap and shampoo. 4. Every morning they provide breakfast. It's nice. They have ceral, cheese, toast (upon request), yogart and hard boiled eggs. To drink they have orange juice, apple juice, coffee, hot chocolate etc. My only complaint I like my milk cold for ceral and their was always warm. 5. Staff. I purchased 4 hours of internet and was told to sign on in would record the time without any other explaination. So I only used maybe 2 hours the next day I had none left. They forgot to explain you have to physicaly log off you cannot just shut down your computer. They gave me 2 free hours for the mis-understanding. I only had a problem with one guy who worked night shift. Our phone was cut off from making calls for two nights in a row he refused to cut it back on without charging my card that would later be returned but I spoke to another guy who said they wouldn't charge a holding fee just keep my number incase. We went around and around. Finally someone else from our group spoke to him and he agreed to cut in back on. Likes: Rooms are very clean! Staff was nice with the exception of the one late shift worker. Dislikes: No high-speed internet. They charge 20 pounds for 4 hours.

Having read a lot of bad reviews about the seedy budget hotels in London, we were very apprehensive about our stay especially since we were travelling with a toddler. But I would say that the stay was very pleasant. We booked one double room and a twin room (one for my husband, myself and my toddler and another for a visiting family friend) and both rooms were good. And just a hop, skip and jump to Kings Cross station. The carpet was a bit frayed, but that is expected. The beds were done well, though the blankets were very worn. The room was very neat and tidy and the shower room was good size and clean. There were lots of towels, crispy clean and white. Cant expect more in a five star hotel. The hand soap, shampoo and the shower jel smelled nice and felt like good quality stuff. The tea tray was adequate with some biscuits, which was perfect for our toddler. And lots of restuarants and coffee bars around, you will never be stranded for a choice. The breakfast room was very small and we had to go back to our room twice as there was no table available. Apart from that, the continental breakfast was adequate with lots of toast (you have to ask), juice, selection of cereals, selection of beverages, croissonts, buns, cold meat, yoghurt and eggs. The fruit was canned, though. The attitude of the staff right from the front desk to the service staff were excellant. When I asked someone at the front desk to warm some milk for my toddler, it was done immediately, with a smile. The front desk staff were also very polite and alert and knowledgable about the tourist destinations. Its as if they all love their jobs- I would give a special mention to the Philipina lady who was supervising the breakfast service - very polite and pleasant to deal with. On the negative side, the room was a bit noisy from the traffic outside and our room was overlooking a garage. With a double bed and a baby cot, there was barely any room to move. The washbasin was blocked. But these are some silly stuff we overlook, given that we are in London.

The location is very convenient to the King's Cross Tube station and St Pancras International. We were within a two minute walk of the station, and as it is a major hub for several underground lines, this made traveling around the city a breeze. We left London via Eurostar for Paris, which departs from St Pancras, so this also worked out very conveniently. The hotel is in an older building, tucked around the block from the rail and underground stations. The staff is very pleasant and friendly.

I experienced a bit of culture-shock over the high prices of hotels and everything else in London, but I believe the price tag was appropriate if not modest when I was looking for comparable properties in the area. The rooms were clean but small (again, this is apparently typical for all of moderately priced Western Europe hotels); the high-speed Internet access was pricey, considered how slowly it actually functioned. The room rate included continental breakfast with a large number of options (cereals, toast, boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, juices) the fresh croissants were quite good, the coffee was mediocre (made from a machine, not fresh brewed pots). I can't say enough, though, about the kindness and courtesy shown by the staff. My daughter and I were in and out of the hotel many times per day, they always greeted us, remembered our names, and could even inform me if my daughter had arrived or departed in my absence when she and I went on our separate forays around the city. While the area may seem a little sketchy after dark (after the crowds of tourists using the Tube stop and train station have dwindled away), during the day it felt quite safe.

I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting luxury but to be fair my room, which was 116, was clean and tidy with a very comfortable bed. Room 116 is possessed of a few idiosyncrasies. The shower is interesting. The angled space-saver design means that the door hinges about a third of the way along its width. Consequently, unless you are a size zero model you have to press your back against the freezing cold tiles in order to close the door behind you. Also, the temperature control knob was for decoration only and the flow wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the froth off your latte. Sort of, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the force Luke\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6warm. Far and away the most interesting aspect of room 116 is that it is immediately off the ground floor Reception area. Yes that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not on the first floor and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not seven or eight rooms from the lift. The sash window opens onto the pavement and the bed is located so that the headboard is a stud wall thickness from Reception, which made for a very noisy stay. People coming and going in the early hours and doors banging from about 6am. This also means that the thunder-box is situated adjacent to Reception and the corridor to the rooms. You can overhear every word of conversation which I guess means\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6well I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure you have it figured. The hotel staff were polite and helpful, tipping me off to a great Italian restaurant just around the corner (Cassa Mamma, Kings Cross), which was very busy but worth waiting for a table.

Both of the rooms we were in were in the basement, but on different sides of the building. I wonder if there are drainage issues on the right side. Location was fine--restaurants and pubs to walk to, different forms of public transportation not too far away. Overall, London was easier to get around than I expected. The immediate area was not touristy, but seemed safe and relatively quiet. I would stay at this hotel again, but would try elsewhere first. I think a hotel owner should think of their business as they would a home: Would I give these accommodations to a friend?

This is by far the worst hotel we have ever stayed at in. By far... Well, let the pictures speak for themselves. This is what happened: Stayed in this hotel in October 2006. We were originally placed in one of the basement rooms. It was very humid. Mold was all over the bathroom ceiling. Once you used a towel, it would remain wet. We were told the hotel was booked solid, so there was no opportunity to switch rooms at that time. A middle-aged couple next door smoked like chimneys and kept their door open for ventilation. Even with our door closed the room constantly smelled of cigarette smoke. That, however, was a blessing in disguise, as we later learned. Our neighbors left the next day, and the smoke cleared. After we stepped into our room that evening, it smelled like something died in it. As it turned out, it was the smell of mold. We just couldn't feel it the night before because of all the cigarette smoke. And it grew considerably too. We had no idea mold would actually smell so rancid, nor did we know it could grow that fast. We also noticed various grey and brownish stains on some of the new towels left by housekeeping earlier that day. But - by comparison - that was the least of our concerns at that point. We needed to get out of \"the dungeon\". Eventually we were able to move into a different room (on the ground floor). The picture of a filthy faucet is from that second room. And the pillow too. Really, there were a lot more photo opportunities of the same kind in this place. We weren't rude when pointing out all of these things to the hotel staff. And the staff weren't rude either. They just don't care. When I asked them about the mold in our first room, the exact reply was \"Oh yeah. We were just waiting for you guys to leave so that we could clean it up.\" When I mentioned the dirty towels and sheets, this is what they told me: \"Our laundry is done off-site, by another company.

We visited many sights with our passes and enjoyed a couple of theater productions. Everything was easily accessible from Kings Cross. We even traveled to Chislehurst, Eltham, Greenwich, and Hampton Court with ease using our travelcards to catch the trains. My only complaints were the mattress pad on my bed which was falling apart and not very smooth and the noisy neighbors we had above us for a few nights. Other than that, and a bit of cold rainy weather, our trip could not have been better.", "Date": "March 13, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn Kings Cross", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d189734-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Kings_Cross-London_England.html", "Price": "$154 - $448*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2-5 St Chad's Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WCIH 8BD</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "189734", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2c/55/2c55866de6485c488b835a3f8ecbd0063large.jpg"}}
