Bed-wise, it was a squeeze for the 3 of us into one queen-bed. But it wasn't too bad either. Then again, we're asian and generally smaller built. Beds were comfy and we slept well. The blackout blinds in the bedroom worked wonders. Bathroom... there was only one bathroom without a door (there are doors that close on the shower and the water-closet separately). The shower door was translucent, so to provide some privacy, we used the water-closet door to block the view from the living room to the shower. Location... very good. Yes, it's abit of a walk to the MTRs, but both MTRs were on the more accessible lines so didn't require much changing of trains once we were there. It was fine for us to walk... except the little one with the lazy bones who wanted to be carried. Crockery... If it wasn't enough, you could ask for more. Breakfast... simple but enough. Buns, pastries, fruits, toast... I think there was usually quite a queue for the coffee machine. Sometimes we bought back food from nearby like the chee cheong fun, and dimsum for breakfast.

I prefer to choose MTR Sham Shui Po if travel to Mongkok and Tsim Sha Tsui line-however, its crowded until afternoon-many food and shop but a bit quite at night. If you want to go to Disneyland, Lantau Island (Ngong Ping 360), take Tung CHung LIne from MTR Nam Cheong. TO HKIA, stop at Tsing Yi Station and transfer with HKIA Express-very convenient. You can also take bus at Lai Chi Kok road which is only 3 blocks from the hotel-but it takes more time to wait and sometimes bus will take a longer route to the destination-however, MTR is still the best choice. The hotel is small but very well decorated and have unique concept to traveler. The lobby and lounge is amazing and cool to sit (when the outdoor weather is too hot to handle), room is white and layout is cleverly designed even the each bedroom is small to keep our luggage.

The toilet has an open concept; there is no door at the toilet, which may be a little inconvenient. Breakfast was complimentary on the lobby area (first floor). There were pies, muffins, bread, yoghurt, coffee/tea, etc. Bottled drinks were also available in the fridge, but were only for consumption in the lobby area. Hotel staffs were generally helpful and considerate. Security guard at the entrance was also very friendly. Overall, the service was great. Location wise, it is about a 10 minute walk from either train station (Nam Cheong or Sham Shui Po). Not exactly very near, but not that far either. It may be a little of a hassle and tiring if you're carrying alot of bags after a whole day of shopping. Taxi may be a better choice for big groups, but do bring along the hotel's namecard as not all taxi drivers are familiar with Ovolo. I would choose to stay at Ovolo again if I am travelling in a big group.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "kuala lumpur", "Title": "\u201cBest Things come in Small Packages - Less is More Part 31\u201d", "Author": "ECKLKualaLumpur", "ReviewID": "UR126372807", "Content": "Finding affordable AND quality accommodations in HK is super difficult so stumbling upon Ovolo over the internet was a bit of a godsend. As we were traveling in a party of 7 (with young children & elderly parents), we needed the convenience & practicality of a small apartment set up. The West Kowloon branch (OWK) is the only one with 3BR options. Firstly, this is located in the working class neighborhood of Sham Shui Po (the MTR is a 10-min walk away). It is NOT the slick, modern and cosmopolitan face of HK; so please be aware. But for history & culture buffs, this neighborhood represents the HK of old which is fast disappearing (we saw numerous notices plastered on old tenement buildings slated for urban renewal). It can also be a goldmine for photography enthusiasts. There is a lively street market and in the evenings, it transforms into a 2nd hand/antique bazaar. Secondly, OWK is a new multi-storey point-block tower with only 3 units per floor - quite private. Its signage is very discreet and not very familiar with taxis so keep a hotel card handy. However it is super convenient to get to and from from HKIA - only 30 minutes max! (not rush hour). Thirdly, the apartment layout is a marvel in space planning with the tiniest of rooms (if you can call them \"rooms\" 'cos they only fit the bed + a small built-in closet) but according to our HK relatives, this is the HK reality and norm. But the bedding is very clean, comfortable and luxurious. Windows are large and the spaces are always filled with light. In spite of the proximity to the highway, the well-insulated windows cut off all traffic noises. The only weird part of the apartment had to be the bathroom which SHOULD come with a door. Granted the toilet/WC was in a compartment of its own and the shower within a frosted glass screen, undressing in the dry area was nearly impossible because you were in direct view from the living room. We had to flip the WC door outwards to screen off the line of vision when using the bath. (Note to management: Installing an outer door at the side hallway is easy given the existing layout configuration). Finally, the service was quite wonderful and super courteous, English spoken widely, everyone was helpful right down to the main door security. Special requests are handled professionally and precisely. The ladies at the breakfast buffet would \"mother\" you and ply you with more food. Would we come back to OWK? Its a definite YES!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cBest value family accomodation!\u201d", "Author": "ariffaris", "ReviewID": "UR126121848", "Content": "We were at Ovolo 256 Tung Chau Street for 3 nights and we were very happy with our stay.

Compared to a usual HKG hotel room size the space we had here was very spacious for us. The apartment is equipped with almost all necessary stuff travelers could need - large flat screen TV with heaps of international channels, Apple TV, DVD player, fridge, toiletries, microwave, and etc. I noticed they also have an iPad for borrow. There was no kitchen utensils in the kitchenette but this wasn't a big concern for us as we normally eat out. Cleanliness may be the only issue I would like to raise. The floor of the apartment was quite greasy due to an unknown cause. I felt a bit disgust to walk barefoot in the room. Lucky they provided slippers so the problem fixed. But still I would appreciate if they take a better care in the cleanliness of the unit. Facilities: There is no restaurant on site, only a small dining area with a tiny bar on the lobby floor where continental breakfast is served. Free soft drinks are provided and you can get free drinks of alcohol during 6 to 8pm. No swimming pool on premise but they have a small gym on the ground floor. Location: A little drawback for this place is its location. This apartment isn't in the city centre, or isn't even close to any tourist attraction. The nearest MTR would be the Sham Shui Po station which is about 10 mins walk from the premise. Nearby areas: There is a busy morning market nearby where you can get brekkie and it turns into a local market selling second hand stuff at night. Although the surrounding atmosphere during the night is obviously not for tourists but we didn't feel unsafe to walk back to the unit. Services: Noting to complain.

The site said there was no availability but the amazingly helpful bookings coordinator from Ovolo emailed back very quickly and said he could fit us in but we might have to swap apartments during our week stay - we accepted and in fact we didn't have to. Superb. The area the apartment is in is fine - it's not the department store sterile / no atmosphere of some we have stayed in - but it is safe and friendly. All the store owners we spoke with were veyr helpful and friendly. The building is between two MTR stations - both 5 mins walk in opposite directions - one takes you on the central line through Mong Kok and straight down to Tsim Sha Tsui (which is the main place where you can go to the Star Ferry / tourist office / musuems etc) and the other is Nam Cheong which is a direct line to Hong Kong going South or Lantau Island for the Buddha or Disneyland. All the MTR journeys are super quick and so for us to get to Central (HK Island) station from the apartment was less than 30 mins. And with kids that's not bad! The apartment itself is good - briliant air conditionning so you sleep very soundly on comfy beds with feather duvets. The shower is superb. TV is flat large screen - when we were actually in the apartment it had all the cable channels you could want. And the added bonus that the website doesn't tell you is that breakfast is free - cereal / toast / buns / coffee / juice and that from 6pm to 8pm is 'happy hour' with coca cola / sprite / spirits / wine all for free! Reception staff were very helpful and friendly (they phoned for delivery pizza for us when we asked!). All in it was great.
