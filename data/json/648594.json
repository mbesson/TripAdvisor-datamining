Positive points were that the location was great, so close to cbd and train station which will get you just about anywhere in sydney. The beds and pillows were super comfortable!The rooms were quite cool and stylish but definitly favours form over function! Low points of the standard suite were.. the bathroom is a 'wet room' ie open shower (no walls) so consequently after someone has had a shower the whole bathroom floor is wet so cant use to change clothes in etc. Also the top toilet seat was missing so toilet gets all wet as it is right next to shower... also may sound a bit pedantic but the towel rail was ridiculously low so the big bath sheet/towels they give you can barely be hung up... and across the mirror the words ''Ellie is a Pig\" was sort of stained across the mirror(very strange?!?!) Our tv would sometimes not turn on and we had to get reception to come and fix this twice. When we got there the internet was not working for the first day and twice also we had to ring down to reception to ask for toilet paper as the cleaners never left any spare. Also when we got to our room the phone was turned to silent so we missed a bunch of phone calls which was really annoying. Each day the room was serviced they never did anything other than make the beds and change our towels - during our whole stay they never vacuumed or wiped down any surfaces..lastly the receptionist that was on most days was totally unfriendly... when we checked out and paid our combined bills of over $2000 she didnt even thank us, barely even spoke to us during whole transaction and honestly, I could understand if we were real complainers/horrible guests etc but we were just normal everyday tourists and we hadn't complained once. ON THE OTHER HAND... The terrace suite was really quite lovely and the cleaners thoroughly cleaned this suite each day .It had 2 massive bedrooms and 2 big bathrooms (Although we had asked for 2 queen beds and on arrival found 2 singles + 1 queen and when we rung to ask them to change it they did it the next day.and there ) Only thing that let it down was it had light beige carpet that had masses of stains and two large red wine stains in lounge and bedroom.So in conclusion I basically got the impression from this hotel that its not worth staying here unless you have the more expensive rooms and in which case if you've got the money I'd advise taking your money somewhere else due to the lack of hospitality we found:) Also side note the room service is from the asian restaurant downstairs so consequently only available during their opening hours and they are closed Sundays", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGreat value lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "HollyGolightlyUK", "ReviewID": "UR26503084", "Content": "We stayed here for a week whilst taking in the sights and sounds in and around Sydney.

I opted for car parking, which although is located in a separate complex to the hotel is secure and <2mins walk away. The hotel does explicitly state that there is limited car parking availability and recommends requesting this prior to your stay (I reserved a spot one week beforehand, no hassles). I found the service warm and professional, greeted every morning as I left to go out and were always helpful to any requests that I had. Location is very good also, in Chinatown itself, but about 10mins walk to Darling Harbour and within walking distance of George St. bars and nightclubs. Bonus perks include free in-room broadband internet access and complimentary newspaper. The cleanliness I found to be below the otherwise high standards of the VOG. While by no means filthy per se, attention could have been paid to the grubby marks on the walls, sticky (and unknown) residue around the bathroom vanity counter and dust around some of the more obscure places. Also, I was staying with a friend who had booked another double room directly adjacent. Whilst that room was endowed with mostly the same fittings, it was considerably smaller and darker. It might therefore be worthwhile requesting one of the 'corner' rooms (in my case, 401). But yes, overall very satisifed with my stay at the VOG. It's atmospheric 'charm' and customer service were definite highlights and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middlesbrough", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "pbv", "ReviewID": "UR14364046", "Content": "We stayed at the Valentine for five nights and had a fantastic time there the room was modern boutiqe style with a great shower area and lots of space to move around in with little quirky touches to make it special i.e a bose sound system.

I stayed in a King suite and was given a very clean, modern and stylish room. There was some nice touches - like Bang & Olufsen phones, large bath sheets, a scented room mist, Bose tv and very well thought out lighting. In addition, the bathroom was lovely and modern, with a strong and easily temperature adjusted shower - this can be hard to find!! The service was courteous and professional. A downside was the hotel parking - about 50 metres down the road in a rabbit warren complex that was hard to navigate. Reception said that the majority of their complaints was about parking. As a small boutique hotel, they do not have some usual hotel facilities (such as a pool or gym) but if you are willing to forgo this, its perfect. I paid $170 for one night on Mardi Gras weekend - which represented excellent value.

I was at a bit of an advantage when I started looking for somewhere in the city having been to Sydney 3 times before. I knew I wanted to be down the Chinatown/Darling Harbour end of the city and homed in on the George St / Pitt St area. Valentine on George is a little hidden treasure. The taxi driver did have a bit of a job trying to find it, its on a little one way street off George St which is always handy to let the cabby know. Its pretty much opposite the 790 on George (a huge backpackers). There are only a handful of rooms here and couple of suites, which I'm sure would be equally as lovely. The view is not the best out the window but the inside of the room is so funky and hip you don't want to spend time looking out of it. Very modern place and very quiet which is a blessing in a busy bustling city. Beautiful wet-tiled bathroom. Magical lighting system as well. About a 5-10min stroll to Darling Harbour and a short walk to Hyde park where you can get buses to the Quay/Bondi/Coogee. The only downside was that the staff were a little bit clueless when I asked about localities of places, like the laundrette, how to get to Bondi (the guy on the desk said we had to get a cab, no buses went there! which I knew was a lie as I had jumped on one before!) Other than that it was a great stay.

At the moment, the prices are generally moderate but amazingly cheap for such high design values. The rooms are very trendy, suitably romantic and extremely large. The bathroom is stocked with good quality toiletries and is a joy to look at and use. Everything was very clean and dust free in my stay. There are a host of really smart design features: high end sound system, concealed TV, properly sealed doors, high cealings and a curtain to easily hide your ugly luggage and shoes. There are some things that could be annoying. The bed is stiff but the soft pillows combine to make sleep comfy. There is road noise and light leaking into the room throughout the night. The TV is not very functional and the bench cushions slide around and provide no back comfort. The concrete floor works for me but I always like them. The place is dimly lit but there is task lighting where it's needed. I totally agree with the positive reviews of the restaurant on the ground floor. It is unbeatable for value and the meals are delicious and amazingly presented. It's all in keeping with the smart creativity of the whole place. The photos I've seen others post and the hotel use are pretty accurate.
