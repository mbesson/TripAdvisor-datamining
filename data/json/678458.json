Staying here made the trip a bit more affordable. The rooms were small - we had a double, a twin, and a baby cot (for our 2yo, ahem, baby). And there was barely room to walk. The carpets are pretty trashed. But you can't expect luxury for this price. The breakfast room was fine and hey, there was breakfast. The location is pretty darn unbeatable. Walk to Hyde Park easily, steps from Earls Court tube station, on the edge of the Chelsea - the wealthiest neighborhood in London. Nothing about the rooms grossed me out - were clean if worn. They weirdly seemed to try to add luxury by providing us with approximately 82 little packets of shampoo. Staff were fine, if not overtly friendly. Average place, great location, reasonable cost.

Stayed in a triple room which was located on the third floor. Please note there is no lift in this hotel yet personally I didn't find this a problem as we only had to carry our bags up the stairs once - on arrival, and then down again - on departure. So it wasn't a huge obstacle as previous reviews make it out to be! Although compact, I found the room cosy with everything we needed for our short stay. It even had a fan which helped a lot when we felt a bit stuffy at night. The normal tea/coffee facilities were present in the room with the addition of a microwave and fridge. The bathroom was also compact but modern, and possibly only recently renovated. The breakfast was very basic but we were aware of this on booking so it wasn't a surprise. We only had breakfast in the hotel on the first morning - basic cereal and tea and toast. Didn't have an issue with queues but others after us had to wait at the door for a table.On the other two mornings we opted to have a lie-in and instead got breakfast in a lovely pub at the top of Barkston Gardens Road called \"The Blackbird\". The room was provided with new towels and linen each day, and the cleaning lady always greeted us in the hall. Personally, the best thing I found about the hotel was the location. It was approx a 5 minute walk from Earls Court tube station which was great for getting around the city and various tourist attractions. And only a 3 minute walk from M&S and other various shops. For those giving negative reviews it must be reminded that St. Mark's in Earls Court is not a leisure hotel but simply somewhere to sleep at night. We didn't spend much time in the hotel during the day, only slept there at night. If your planning a relaxing trip away in a nice hotel, I'd opt for somewhere more expensive. But in light of this being a budget/basic hotel, it is by far a basic hotel of the highest standard. Knowing we had opted for a basic hotel, I found myself pleasantly surprised at how comfy and clean St. Mark's was, and this is possibly the reason I regard it so much. Ultimately, lower expectations gave rise to a pleasant and thoroughly enjoyable stay at St. Mark's, Earl's Court.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cMixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "R0adtripjunk1e", "ReviewID": "UR124656811", "Content": "We booked three nights at this hotel for a family with three adults and one child. Granted, it was a super cheap price especially for 4 people, however it fell slightly short of the mark. For instance, the breakfast room was too small, and we had to wait to get a seat, but if you time it right you can get in. The breakfast consisted of cereals, orange juice, toast, cold boiled eggs and rubbery cheese. We noticed that the eggs were probably the ones not eaten from the day before too. There was tea and brewed coffee but it was of cheap quality. The hotel staff barely spoke English and couldn't seem to take in what we were saying when I asked for more cups for our room. My main complaint though is that the television in our room was unwatchable. It was a wide, flat screen tv and had 'satellite tv' but only if you speak in Arabic. It was tuned to a small selection of channels that I couldn't recognise. We complained about it to reception but the man just said it was the aerial connection. On our insistance he said he would speak to the manager about it, and try and take a look at it, the next day we noticed we had one of the main terestrial channels but it was snowy, like you were trying to watch using a coat hanger for an aerial. There was a tv in reception which seemed to be tuned into CBBC ok and the one in the breakfast room was tuned into a music channel. So I don't understand why they had aerial problems. Also the fridge in our room froze everything in it within a matter of hours. there was no temperature control on the fridge either. There was a microwave, kettle and sink in our room which was great for preparing some food but no toaster as advertised. The bathroom was modern and lovely, and the beds were comfortable (I slept well) and as the others have said there were plenty of sockets. The room was clean and serviced daily. It even had a telephone but no number for reception was given to call. There was also no welcome pack with hotel information. The hotel was in a quiet, lovely street and close to shops, pubs and restaurants, Earls Court Road and the tube station. This was the best thing about the hotel.

The street has the Barkston Gardens (green area) at the right and many hotels at the left. There is also a Youth Hostel across the road.

When we arrived we were told that there was no reservation for us. There was a misunderstanding with our credit card and instead of trying to contact me about the problem they did nothing. As the man at the check-in desk said \"I thought it was a joke.\" A joke? He didn't speak English that well so arguing with him got us no where. In any case, he did manage to find us a room at their sister hotel down the street, the Oxford Hotel. We came back the St. Mark the next night for the rest of our stay. We were initially put in a room for 3 people with a cot (we were a group of 4). With the cot in the room, the space was very tight, but we managed. We were then moved to a much larger room for 4 people and were very happy after that. The hotel was finishing up some renovations at the time, but this did not bother us. Everything was brand new and very clean (Ikea-like furnishings). The beds were moderately comfortable and no signs of bed bugs. There was a more than adequate bathroom with sink, toilet, and shower in the room, closet space, small table and chairs, and TV with satellite. There was no lift, but we were on the first floor so that did not bother us. Breakfast consisted of self-serve breads, eggs, meats and cheese, coffee, tea, and juice. It was available in the basement with limited seating and a TV. In both rooms that we stayed in, we were not disturbed by other guests making noise. We were however quite disturbed by the fire alarm going off each morning, presumably because of breakfast cooking. All in all, I'd say the hotel was much nicer than others in the area for the same price, but the costumer service leaves a lot to be desired.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate New York", "Title": "\u201cRudeness at Front Desk concerning payment method\u201d", "Author": "TEH2", "ReviewID": "UR21074623", "Content": "My regular Earls Court area Hotel was booked last weekend, so I did a search and found this one as a replacement.

The response was ,\" It doesn't,\" even through I had in-fact used it.

In checking my Visa statement on-line today, I find I was charged the quoted rate upon check in - then upon check out was charged the quoted rate plus 3%, resulting in a \"pending\" charge for the former. I'm watching closely to be sure a \"double-bill\" isn't being attempted.
