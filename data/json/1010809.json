I will definitely return and will be recommending this to any friend or family who wishes to visit Rome.

So, at midnight, after 3 calls and 2 trips to the front desk, they finally changed our room. In this room, no tub, and very small (not even room for 2 suitcases) for the same price. This room had a problem with the toilet. The water never stopped running in it after flushing...we were afraid it would flood the room. Again, a call and trip to the front desk where we were told that no one was available to fix it until \"later\" (this was 6 am). We left for the day and when we returned, we were told it was fixed, but after 2 times, the problem returned. We were never so happy to leave a hotel! When we asked if we could please be compensated somehow for our problems with the room; we were told that we would still have to pay the full price for the stay...INCREDIBLE!!

Our room was spacious, with welcome air-conditioning ( temperatures during the day were in the thirties), and a glorious wet-room- much appreciated after many hours out seeing the sights. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly- when we asked for recommendations for somewhere to eat, they directed us to a delightful, local family restaurant which we liked so much that we went back the following night. The Continental breakfast each morning was fresh and tasty, with more than enough variety to choose from. Next to the breakfast room there is a pretty little terraced area where we used to take a glass of wine in the evening, and just chill out listening to the sounds of the city around us, and watching the planes fly in to the airport. Very romantic!! The local area felt extremely safe, and there is a good selection of shops to browse around within a five minute walk.

Unfortunately the rooms are very small - it\u2019s almost got a cruise ship like layout (imagine a suite on a cruise ship). Very high ceilings so that helps. The furnishings and toilet are very upscale modern clean lines so its really cool looking hotel but again the rooms are small. Breakfast was good and covered all the basics to ensure there is something for everyone. Great bread - cold meats - eggs - croissants and cake - cereals - jams - juices and coffee. Its basic though not high end hotel selection. The breakfast area is on the 3rd floor and it\u2019s a really nice set up. The area has glass enclosure all around that gives it\u2019s a nice atmosphere in the morning. You have access to large patio to either eat outside or enjoy your coffee. Its located on 3rd floor so its bright and full of fresh air with access to the outdoor patio. The location of the hotel for being outside of the center of Rome is the biggest plus for this hotel when you factor two things - cost and being in a local neighbourhood that provides a glimpse into the everyday life of Romans. Being outside of the center you really feel like you are the only tourist walking around (which is really cool) You can take advantage of the pricing for restaurants - shopping and general items you would purchase - access to Pharmcy - foodmarket etc. Obviously being in the center of Rome would be more convenient from access to sites and Piazza but you pay dearly for it. This hotel is a 5 min walk to Di Roma Metro station. The cost for a three day pass is approx 15EUR. This metro stop is 3 stops to the main Terminal which is a main point to get to the subway line to the Coliseum or continue on this line 3-5 stops for other major attractions like the Spanish Steps and Fountain Trevi. It addition to the Metro pass you have access to all the buses which is a big plus getting around the centre of Rome. The center of Rome is huge and even though its great to walk its benefical and cost effective to have access to the enourmous amount of buses to just hop on on hop off to get off your feet and get accross town quickly to the other major sites. The walk to the Metro and to the Piazza of Di Roma (think of it as the downtown section to the neighbourhood you are staying in - lots of shopping and restaurants - just a great atmosphere when you are not sightseeing. Again nice neighbourhood and you feel safe walking at all hours but as any big city you need to be careful and use common sense but during the day and early evening there are too many people around to encounter issues. Late at night it gets very quiet - shops are closed (around 8pm other then some restaurants). We walked late at night from one of the Metros because it closed down at 9 pm and it took 20 mins to walk from the center of Rome perimeter to our hotel. In closing if you are looking to reduce your costs and don't mind walking from the hotel to the metro or to the train station (different transportation to get to the airport - about a 10 min walk to the Tuscola station) then I highly recommend this place. The staff was friendly - helpful but their English is not good. Get a map - metro pass and you will be in good hands.

Small room (be careful not to tear down the TV with your shoulder when you pass between the beautiful sculptured wall and the bed; shower with no door or screen; wc with transparent, plastic, untight sliding shutters and a vent-fan that sounds like a small aeroplane; washbasin with a shelf the size of a hardcover book for all the toilet articles of 2 persons (your wife would love it, along with the single alogen spot light directly overhead that turns her face into a zombie's at make-up time). More: wardrobe with no shelves, the capacity of a standard gym locker (in a double rum); noisy aircond blowing directly on the bed (small room, remeber); window opening at the level of the neighbour's courtyard (dare to leave it open?) and only a few meters from its wall. Want more? OK: indifferent breakfast with industrial bread briquets (in a city gifted with marvelous bread); orange juice to be enjoyed in flimsy plastic airplane-style mugs and a queue to the Nescafe machine (in a 4 stars hotel). The imposing espresso bar machine is off, too much work. To this can be added that the hotel is placed wall-to-wall with a fire station, and on the fast route to one of Rome's largest Hospitals, which is likely to entertain you at all hours, day and night.

The hotel is very easy to find using the instructions from the hotel website. I took the time to look on Google Streetmap to locate the hotel so I had a better idea of where to go. Check in was a breeze and the guy who checked us in was very helpful. He provided us with a map and circled all the sights together with drawing the bus routes on there so we knew which one to take, where to get on and off and the route it followed. Our room (215) was very cosy! We had been given a disabled room so the bathroom was huge but the bedroom area was very small. We had one single wardrobe and no drawer space but we managed just fine. We found the bed to be very comfortable and slept well all nights. The aircon was also very good. The room was beautifully decorated and impeccably clean. Toiletries were provided and there were never any issues with a lack of hot water. It was constant and very hot! The breakfast was plentiful and we enjoyed it. There were cereals, ham, salami, cheese, croissants, bread rolls, yogurts, cakes, toast, boiled eggs, scrambled eggs and bacon/sausage mixture. There was also a coffee machine, 2 different flavours of juice, water and milk. On our first afternoon we walked to the Colloseum which is around 2km and took around 45mins (we did take a wrong turn though so had to backtrack!) If you don\u2019t want to walk you can take the tube which is about a 5min walk from the hotel or you can take the number 85 bus from the station which is also around a 5min walk from the hotel. We found the buses to be very reliable, although sometimes a little bit on the full side! You can buy tickets for the bus and the train at newsagents in the stations or on the bus. Remember to validate your ticket on the bus when you board. Although the area surrounding the hotel is not the nicest looking, we never felt unsafe \u2013 even late at night. I found that being on the outskirts gave a true reflection of Italian life. We found a lovely restaurant called La Allegra (The Happy Sheep). The food here was absolutely AMAZING and we ate here every night of our break. Being outside of the city centre means the quality of food is better and the prices cheaper. We were having either a pizza or a pasta dish each and at least a litre of wine and the bill was never over 30euros \u2013 that includes the 10% service charge and our additional tip (a steal at the side of 15euros for 2 beers on a side street a few minutes walk from the Colloseum!) The pasta at this place is the most amazing I have ever ever tasted!! It was fantastic. The menu is all in Italian but we managed and there is one of the waiters who speaks very good English and will happily help you out. There is a little supermarket on the street at the back of the hotel. We used to pick up a bottle of wine and drink it on the terrace at the hotel. We did ask before we did this and the receptionist was shocked that we\u2019d even asked \u2013 \u2018this is your hotel \u2013 treat it as your home\u2019 was the response we got. How lovely!

The only downside to the room was that there was no door on the shower and the loo door did not shut entirely so not much privacy but we managed! Overall however, the decor was fine, the room was clean and it was suitably quiet for a good night's kip after a hard day's sight seeing. The best feature is the roof terrace where they serve a decent buffet breakfast. Another great asset has to be the reception staff who were very helpful providing advice from bus times to museum opening times and markets, happy to look anything up for us if they didn't know straight away and spoke good English. I would also advise, if you're a non-smoker, to make sure to request a non-smokng room, away from any smoking rooms. I woke up on the last night because someone was smoking next door and the smell wafted through. The hotel area is ok. Unfortunately there is a lot of graffiti everywhere but that seems quite common! Didn't spot many bars or restaurants, it's mostly a residential area, but we managed to find a nice restaurant called La Violetta nearby for a first evening which was very popualr with the locals.

Our first impression was of a small but very clean, modern hotel set in a period building. The neighbourhood was quiet. . The room was fairly small but not as small as some Italian hotels we have stayed in and the space was very well designed and utilised. The staff here are what makes the hotel so good - they were really friendly, welcoming, knowledgeable, efficient and helpful. While the bar didn't seem to be in use, this wasn't a problem for us but may be for others. We ate in the pizzeria down the street the first night and it was perfect for us after getting off a lateish flight. The hotel is located near to the San Giovanni area which is well worth a stroll to. It is a very picturesque part of town and there was a market taking place the day we walked there which was a Thursday. Also, for anyone with kids, there is a very nice and safe playground near the hotel with some very friendly Roman children to play with. All in all, we had an excellent stay at this hotel - it was surprisingly good for what we had experienced in the past.
