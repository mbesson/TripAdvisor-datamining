The location wasn't exactly in the center of the city -- it was a couple of train stops away from the center, but the location was sufficiently close to the metro and to the center of the city. Upon check-in I was handed my room in the second floor and unfortunately we had some issues with the A/C in that room and after our first night we requested it to be checked and fixed. After a visit from their maintenance man and an inability to fix it, we were moved to another room. The second room was located in the lower level of the other building and although the room was bigger and more comfortable (the A/C worked to perfection) it was a pain for luggage as we had no elevator and had to take multiple stairs (up and down and up again) to exit the other building and enter this new one. Although this was a bit of an inconvenience, it did not create a bad experience. The staff was very accommodating and took care of the situation quickly and efficiently. I enjoyed the property most of all. The building is set in a tranquil landscape with a beautiful surrounding. The backyard patio almost had a spa feel. It seemed like a modern day palace. And I think it had some history to that effect. The lobby is small (hotel is small, so makes sense) and the dining room and sitting rooms in the lobby level are beautiful... Plenty of sitting and lounging areas to make for a comfortable relaxing atmosphere after a hectic day of walking the Madrid streets (and taking excursions from the city as well).

From the outside it looks like an elegant family home of a wealthy aristocrat rather than a hotel. But if was not until we went inside that I was really blown away by the elegance and charm of this incredible hotel. Its now part of the Marriott group but even the JW Marriotts or Ritz Carltons cannot come close to matching the splendour here. Only later I found that it had been the home of the Count of Santo Mauro, and after that the Portuguese embassy. It then became the jewel in the AC hotel chain's crown, and with the Spanish economy in free-fall, Marriott has recently bought this chain. The rooms are spacious, beautifully fitted out in classic-modern style, and the hotel is located in the best and safest area of Madrid, and in walking distance of the city's most elegant shopping. Breakfast is served in the dining room which is a \"must-do experience\", because this dining room was originally the Count's library which has been only slightly modified and is absolutely splendid, as are all the reception rooms in this hotel. The food is excellent, Spanish/international cuisine, though the service still has quite a bit of room for improvement. I am not likely to review any other Madrid hotels, because I'm most unlikely to ever want to stay anywhere else.

And in a hotel that charges these rates and if I am paying for a suite I do not ever want to have a combination shower-tub. That is just not something I will tolerate. Any building that was remodeled lately needs to know that a shower should be separate from a tub.

We stayed at several 5 star hotels along the way. This was not only the worst of our visit but on of the worst that I've ever stayed in. The rooms are clean and large and decently furnished with a large bath -- although the primary color is grey. I like modern but I like more eclectic with some color. After 5 nights the grey/black monotone colors really got to me. The lobby is small -- well there really isn't anything to the hotel except the rooms and a very small check-in area and in the back a smallish lounge and the breakfast/dining room which is tiny (its like a library in a large home). But it isn't so much the rooms as it is 3 other things. The first and largest is the SERVICE. The people are never around. Just try to get served in the bar/lounge area -- and if you do -- just try to get your bill. Each time had to walk around trying to search for service personel. At least with 50 rooms they somehow remember your room number so if you give up and don't sign the bill, it will make it to your room. And don't even try to dial the front desk for help they never answered. I had a pair of pants ironed and they never showed up at the promised time. I had to followup (which took forever) to get them delivered - we almost missed our dinner reservation. The front desk is also the concierge -- these people are nice and speak excellent english, but I was very disappointed when they made a reservation for me and never communicated the results back. I had to physcially go back downstairs to the desk to find out the outcome -- since they rarely answer the phone quickly. They also said walking to the Parado museum would take about 15min.....maybe if one were to run!!! It took closer to 40min.....with an 8 year old this was brutal! The pool is large -- but TOXIC. It is in the basement and there is a very very very strong chlorine smell. When you swim in it it's even worse, taking a breath of air jut above the water makes you gasp. I refused to let my daughter swim in it after the first time - - I have a bit of asthma and I was coughing for days after. I typically understand that 5 star hotel breakfasts can be expensive and I go with the flow. But at 30 euros each (for adults and kids) I don't care how good it is. There were no other options - no a la carte menu not even with room service. In fact when I was served a coffee in the lounge in the morning I was charged for two 30 euro breakfasts (my daughter happened to be sitting next to me). We had this fixed, but I found it very strange that we couldn't get a simple breakfast. We did have dinner outside one night -- good food/creative but spendy. I think there are a ton better places to stay than this one -- we didn't have too much of a choice as we had to book last minute and our first choices were full.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cNot good enough for a 5 star luxury hotel\u201d", "Author": "Franklin10", "ReviewID": "UR16369565", "Content": "Rooms were dark because they are no windows, wooden floors echo in the hotel, therefore noisy, sauna was out of action, and dinner and breakfast were very expensive.

Upstairs, our kids had a twin room, another living room - and a GYM! Wow! Hotel is near the Paseo Castellano district which includes the main shopping streets such as Serrano. We walked to some attractions, otherwise used taxis or public transport. Madrid is absolutely heaving with cabs and they are extremely cheap - I don't think we ever spent more than five euros. We had one breakfast in the hotel which was lovely, but at thirty euros per head, very expensive. I would suggest if you want to eat in the hotel you try to get an inclusive rate.

I have stayed in it's sister hotel the El Retiro (also run by AC) and franly, when you are spending your own money the last thing you want to do is feel let down by a hotel that doesn't come up to your expectations. We booked a suite (102) inside the main building and WOW what a wonderful room. 4 x Floor to (high) ceiling windows with frnch doors that open onto the street below (no balcony though). Although a suite, there is only one giant room separated by an open shelving / bookcase affair which is very tasteful. IF however, you wanted to use this room for say interviews or meetings, you would find the glimpses of the bed through the screens would probably be an issue for you. The decoration of the rooms is typical of AC hotels, slick dark greys and brown shades and metal finish lamps. In some AC hotels (Alicante springs immediately to mind) this \"industrial minimalism\" teamed with black wallpaper can create very dreary and depressing rooms. In the Santo Mauro, where most of the architecture is 19th Century, this mixes very well. Grumbles : You have to open the glass sound proof windows in oorder to shut the outer blackout curtains (electric blinds would be better), the bathroom was \"adequate\" but could have been vetter decorated and there was a certain whiff of drains that would could only overcome by keeping the door closed at all times.

The \"King\" bed was actually two fulls pushed together. The marble bathroom was very nice. The \"mini bar\" was free. The staff was EXTREMELY pleasant, and attentive. The rooms are very clean, and private-- there were only four rooms in our building, and we never saw another guest, although we did hear them! We visited the Ritz, and the Westin, and if I had to pick another hotel, I would probably go with the Westin since it is closest to an American 5 star (although I would only rate it a 4).

The hotel is grossly overrated. Had it been classified as a three star hotel, it would have met expectations. However, expecting a luxury/5-star hotel/European boutique setting, we were dismayed by the experience. In light of another TripAdvisor review, we (thankfully) requested a room in the main part of the hotel. Even there, however, the hotel was disappointing. The accommodations are very loud and have no acoustic protection (no carpeting, not even an area rug, needed given the open hallway structure of the building and wood flooring). Any noise/voices in the hallway carry directly into one's room and awakened us each morning. We could also hear guests walking in the room above us. Furthermore, although we spend little time in the room, it is generally a pleasure to return after an extensive day and evening of touring, etc. Not at the AC Santo Mauro. The rooms are barren with no color or character whatsoever. The television has limited channels, with no movie capability. The bed is a hard platform with mattress, seemingly unaccompanied by even a cushioned pad or other fill. The linens were sub-standard, rough and dry second-grade linen sheets, with no alternative (cotton sheets) available at the hotel. The hair-dryer was broken. The hotel and rooms are dark. The business center is generally unavailable and/or the computers were down. The fitness room is stuffy and humid and other than a limited set of free weights, offers very little. The location is not in central Madrid, and requires a 15-20 minute walk or cab to get there. With that said, the staff was nice and attentive upon request. If the environment is commensurate with what is anticipated, this hotel is fine. If you desire or are accustomed to a true 5-star hotel, without question, stay at the Ritz or the Westin.

But the most over-rated hotel in my experience to date must be the AC Santo Mauro. This hotel is divided into two parts to it. The main building - where the reception, various lounges, various restaurants, garden, swimming pool, gym - is certainly beautiful, with antique furniture fit enough for Louis XIV. The swimming pool is as good as other reviewers have made it out to be, but the gym is lacking not only in equipment, but also in quality. It's in a quiet area and furthermore the staff are very proffesionnal. This part of the building has rooms (as seen on this website) which follow all the other themes and taste seen in the main building of the hotel. Then there's the other part. One gets there by walking past the square courtyardand in this part, one finds some of the suites. And it is a shock. The rooms are rectangular. This lays the foundation for the first problem - like a garage, the rooms have a large door (really large), but no windows. The room was decorated in a fashionably \"minimalist\" and supposedly \"catalan\" style which translates to no paintings on the wall, and only black and white interior decorations. At night (in September) it was hot, but of course our only option is to use the air conditioning (which was slightly noisy). Furthermore the light in the courtyard at night filters through the stylish but useless curtains that cover the door. However the rooms in the main building are in the style/theme of the main building itself. So the question is, what is the point of having a set of rooms which have nothing to do with the rest of the hotel and don't appear in the website? It's a question that AC have not been able to answer to me and (apparently) numerous customers. My advice; go, but make sure that you are getting a room in the main building.
