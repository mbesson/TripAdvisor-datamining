This was by far the worst property and the worst staff I've ever run across. The property is an old converted apartment/condo complex. The pool, bathroom, lobby and \"grounds\" are nothing more than one would expect at a Motel 6 or any other low level hotel chain. The air conditioners are outside each unit, so be aware of the loud motor all day and night long. The staff was rude, rude, rude!! I booked 2 1-bedroom units for a total of 2 adults and 4 kids, and it was terrible--my friend hated it more than I did, and finally even moved to a different resort. I complained to Interval International (my only complaint to them in all these years) and they said they would have moved us, but every timeshare was booked that week (spring break). They gave me free internet instead (which I was told was free anyway, when I originally called). When I called the front desk to get my internet code (after they didn't call me to give it to me), the manager Chris told me that I was calling too much. ?!?!? I had called them twice!! Interval International told them to move me into another unit, but they refused, telling me that they're all the same. The stove-top didn't work. and the toilet in my friend's unit had issues. Our \"patio\" was very teeny tiny and overlooked the Shell gas station! This was the worst timeshare ever. Only 4 months earlier, I had been in Vegas again, and had stayed at Tahiti Village. That resort was 10,000 times better.

The condo was spacious... 2 bedrooms, both with walk-in closets, full kitchen, dinette area, living room, 2 full baths, laundry room, large covered balcony/patio. This place looks like it was built as a rental condo, rather than as a vacation condo, ie, the walk-in closets, large laundry / storage room, large balcony with closet. The week we were there it was cold when we arrived and the temp went up fast by the end of the week, so we used both heating & air conditioning. Both worked very well. I'm happy we were on the 2nd floor because I think that any little noise can be heard below. We got regular calls from the front desk that the people below complained about noise. They even called once when I was in the room alone, just making lunch (barefoot). So I would advise getting an upper floor if you can. The pools are very small. There's one that is strictly enforced as over 18 only, and a shallow pool (about 4') for under 18. We were there when the weather was rather cool, but I can imagine that when it warms up the pools would get very crowded. The hot tubs are similarly segregated. Our boys enjoyed the game room -- pool table, foosball, chess, etc. The location is convenient IF YOU HAVE A CAR. Very important to have a car here, unless you want to wait for taxis every time you want to go out. There was plenty of parking under covered spaces. There's a Raley's grocery store less than half a mile away which was very convenient. Beds were good, but it would have been nice if there were some down pillows. The lighting in the master bath wasn't good for makeup, so I ended up using the children's bathroom for that because they had better lighting.

The family pool was under construction so the water feature was not working but all in all the water was warm and enough chairs to accommodate families, nice large towels provided in room for pool use.

The master bath needs more light and the tub squeaks loudly when you stand in it and it would be very very difficult for and elderly person to get out of the tub, it is deep and the step out is high.

The other issue was the thermostat, we could not get it to change from 82 degrees, I finally called the front desk and they sent over the security guard and he apparently had never worked with the thermostat so all he did was read the directions like I had and nothing changed.

On Monday they had an info session that WAS NOT a push to sell you anything. It was merely sharing time for the concierge, with tips on places to go, etc. It was so nice not to be talked into anything. They just shared their travel info. And they had great bagels and Carl's donuts, too. We got maps for Red Rock Canyon, Ethel M Chocolate Factory, etc. The only drawback to this place is the lack of luxury surrounding the actual resort. It's just a street with restaurants and businesses, so it's not as exciting as being on the Strip. But it was peaceful! It was about a three mile drive to the Strip, which was easy to do.

Rental cars are about as cheap in Vegas as anywhere, so if you're going to be there for more than a couple days, it is highly recommended. The resort has scheduled shuttle service to several locations on the Strip. It is about 10 minutes from the Strip, in a safe, convenient neighborhood, has a wonderful outdoor recreation area with 2 pools, hot tub, and playground equipment. hot tub. The grounds are nicely landcaped. There is as fully equiped fitness center on site. Parking is at or near you door, much of it covered parking. There are first and second floor units, so if you are seniors, be sure to request a ground floor unit as there are many steps to the 2nd floor units and no elevators. Also ask for a unit away from the main street and you will have a pleasant, quiet stay. The community is gated and is apparently a converted apartment complex, so the accomodations are actually a full apartment and spacious. Furnishings are rather spartan, but adequate. Bath lighting is great, living room lighting is inadequate. There is a patio or deck with sliding glass door from the living room. There is an entertainment center in the living room, but nothng in it except a flat screen TV and DVD player. There is no stereo, CD or music player in the living area, just alarm clock radios in the bedrooms, not very accommodating for music lovers, although one of the clock radios has an iPod port and MP3 player input. There are also flat screen TVs each bedroom. The TVs offer a full complement of cable channels. That's nice. There is a full kitchen with a nice complement of kitchenware and equipment, a separate dining area and a snack counter with stools. There is an abundance of towels, linens and pillows provided in the unit. Housekeeping service is once a week. Towel and trash service is available daily upon request. The beds quite comfortable. The linens are exceptional, and if you like them, you can purchase them for a very reasonable price at the front desk to take home. We certainly did. The bedrooms have large walk-in closets with adequate drawer storage. There is no other furniture in the bedrooms except the beds and nightstands. The living room sofa is a pull-out, so the 2-bedroom unit can sleep six. There is a separate laundry room in each unit with full-size washer and dryer. Room detailing and finishing is below timeshare standards since these units were less than upscale apartments. The toilets, annoyingly, are not elongated as would be expected in any modern hotel or timeshare accomodation. The most frustrating part of our one-week stay was the totally inadequate Internet service, which was so slow that it was almost useless, like 10 minutes to download a Web page or e-mail. Staff could have cared less, admitting it was a problem, but doing nothing about it except providing an 800 number to AT&T for the guest to report the problem. After wasting many cell phone minutes on the phone with AT&T, I was told that the service was really bad and that the resort manager had not contacted them to seek assistance or correct the problem, which they traced to a local router on the Embarq phone system. The AT&T operations technician, who said he usually only takes calls from resort managers, said he would call the manager and have her call me with an update. She never did. The problem was not corrected for our entire one-week stay.

I was thinking about a timeshare investment and wanted to check this place out. Upon arrival we were pleased with the looks of the resort, especially the pool area. The concierge offered us a tour of their other facility, The Polo Towers, but we declined. We checked into our room, quickly dropped off our bags and immediately headed out for lunch and sightseeing. However, after arriving back at your room about 4 hours later we noticed how incredibly loud the traffic and airplane noise were. The resort is on S. Decatur, a major street and close to the airport. Our room's windows faced the street and the noise was deafening, like sleeping next to a freeway with airplanes overhead. I called the front desk to request a change of rooms. I was rudely told that there were 3 rooms left but because we were in our room for more than one hour we would be charged a major cleaning fee. I explained that we weren't physically in our room for more than an hour; we had just gotten back from sightseeing. At that point we hadn't even sat on the beds. The front desk person then said he only had 1 room left; he would charge us a cleaning fee and move us closer to the street and asked, \"Do you want that?\" The next day we noticed that they blast music in the courtyard pool area to try and drown out the traffic & airport noise. There are flyers, letters, customer service cards posted all over the establishment about the staff's efforts to make sure guests are comfortable. And yet when we requested a change of room to ensure our comfort, we were met with sarcasm, threats to charge us more money, and a complete lack of caring. The noise, lack of quality and inattention were such a disappointment it ruined our trip.

Going into this, we knew to expect the cheesy sales approach as well as the limited turn down service - it's just part of going to a timeshare resort. We stayed during one of the few off weeks Vegas has - no major conventions, no major acts, etc. Overall, it was a pleasant visit to Vegas. Pro's of Desert Paradise Resort (-/+) Shuttle Service - check \"cons\" too. (+) Remote and quiet (+) comfortable in atmosphere - did not get a rushed feeling, everyone was very personal. Con's (-) Shuttle Service - it is extremely limited - even days where there is no service at all. The shuttle staff is great, but they need to hire more drivers to increase the availability of the shuttle / expand the operating hours. (-) Shuttle service does not go to the airport... Taxi is the only way unless you want to rent a car for literally two trips (to and from airport; there's no need for a car at this resort - waste of money... if you're wealthy, go nuts and rent. Common sense would mean not renting one.) (-) Mold - The site is under a renovation. However, we were in a unit that was not renovated. The air conditioner leaked water over the walkway to the bedroom. It seemed to have been doing that for a long time as there was a strong mold smell in the room. Another disadvantage - the thermostats are locked. Either it's 72 degrees air conditioning of turn off the air completely. Way too cold. (-) Mold part two. The unit we stayed in had a dishwasher that did not drain all of the water out after it had completed its cycle. As a result, when I opened the dishwasher for the first time I was greeted with a wonderful mold smell. I had to run the dishwasher a few times to ease my mold paranoia. (-) The site is going through a renovation, which is does need - though I did not notice any construction actually taking place. Future buyers beware, their renovation may be a \"work in progress\" and may not be completed for a while - just a simple observation over our week long stay. We knew ahead of time that there was at least a 2 mile walk to the strip, but the local transport is easy to use. There is no need to rent a car - just a waste of money and more frustration... Take the 201 bus (1.25 a ride per person). 24/7 operation. Taxi to the strip (Resort to Paris in our example) is 15.00 without tip. To airport (make sure they don't hit the highway or you'll pay an arm and a leg) is 18 without tip. Be wary of the cab drivers though... a lot of them will insist on taking the highway if you catch a cab on the north end of the strip - stratosphere, etc - instruct them to take local only even if the cab driver protests, you'll save a bundle. If you cab driver goes the local route instead of the highway, you know you have a good cabbie - tip him/her well. Reviews of vegas in general... Use the safe!!! don't bring a ton of cash with you. There are a lot of shady people going up and down the strip. Ironically enough the police presence is non existent. The casinos have rent a cops, but they can't do much anyways. Stay in groups, avoid questionable areas - north strip by the stratosphere is a great example. Lastly, if you really want to see all casinos - we did in one week - you will have to then go to Planet Hollywood. I would not recommend making that stop, but it is a requirement if your goal is to hit every casino on your vacation. All casinos have timeshare \"lead generators\" at the doors... but of them all, Planet Hollywood had at least 3-4 per door and they would not let you pass unless you practically pushed them out of the way. They are extremely aggressive. Beware of their presentation - check ripoffreport.com for more info if you don't believe me. We didn't sit for any presentation, but if we had to choose one to sit through, it would not be Planet Hollywood.

It was their first time in Las Vegas. First we were so disappointed by the location, it is easy 3 miles away from the Strip! No way to go there by walk. When you arrive they tell you not to worry because they have shuttle service. But a very poor service, only 2 or 3 shuttles a day, sometimes they drop you off on the Strip but no shuttle to pick you up in the evening. But they will help you for sure to reserve a taxi!!!

At 7.00pm, I was pissed off, still nothing, I proposed myself to take the mattress myself if they had nobody. I had to get mad to have somebody bring me a very bad mattress, that I throw out of the bedroom. And know what, after 5 minutes, they brang a rollaway bed magically!!! Which did not look like broken by the way. We have been so disappointed by this porr service, and the fact that they were lying to us during all the afternoon.

While I didn\u2019t note anything particularly bad about the facility during my five day stay there, neither did I note anything particularly good. In short, I can best sum up the general experience as mediocre, especially when compared to similar types of properties in the area at similar rates. During my five day stay there I occupied a 1 bedroom suite. The suite comes with several amenities including: -A full kitchen with a full size refrigerator, microwave, stove & oven, dishwasher, and a minimum complement of utensils and dinnerware. -A washer and dryer (one of the few amenities not usually offered in this type of property). -Two TV\u2019s (bedroom and living room) -DVD and VCR players (living room only) -Patio with table and chairs While the list of amenities definitely puts the resort ahead of a typical Las Vegas hotel room, closer inspection reveals that this property suffers in comparison to similar types of properties in the Las Vegas area that can be had at similar rates. Points which detract from the amenities and the overall experience include: - A bland, uninspired and incongruous interior d\u00e9cor with mediocre quality furniture in mediocre condition. Specifically, the d\u00e9cor is typical Best Western but with no universal theme, either in a particular room or throughout the suite. The quality of the furniture and furnishings can best be described as WalMart or Target quality and, although not falling apart, the majority has definitely seen better days and looked it. Other properties of this type offer much better furnishings and much nicer decors. - The appliances are all Whirlpool\u2019s economy models. So don\u2019t expect any of the better features such as a timer for the oven. Again, similar types of properties in this area offer better models of appliances with more features. - The same can be said of the TVs and DVD player. The TV does not offer anyway to access the DVD input directly. Instead you have to turn the TV to channel 2 and then change the channel down one on the remote to access the auxiliary input. It appears that the remote was specifically made for hotel rooms and doesn\u2019t anticipate the need for the TV to access an auxiliary input. I never did figure out how to access the VCR from the TV, but since it wasn\u2019t plugged into the TV and I didn\u2019t have any videocassettes I wanted to play I didn\u2019t worry about it. I guess the management expects you to unplug the cables from the back of the DVD player and plug them into the VCR if you want to use it. Also, only an average compliment of TV channels was available (I was really looking forward to watching AMC and there was, of course, no HBO, Cinemax, or other premium channels), and there was no channel listing or guide available. Again, the entertainment compares well to the average Las Vegas hotel room, but other properties of this type in this area offer much better setups with a full compliment of channels, a channel guide, a full featured remote, etc. In other words, much more like home. An even more glaring deficiency, even compared to standard hotel rooms, is the lack of free WiFi access. At Sunterra\u2019s Paradise Resort you have to pay for WiFi: a minimum of $22 for 3 days or $40 per week (although free access is available in the lobby). And sadly, in my suite, I had to be within 4 ft. of a window before I could even connect to it (and that\u2019s with a brand new MacBook Pro). These days even economy hotels offer free WiFi. There are many other examples of a bent towards economy in the furnishings, for example: -The floor creaked loudly when I walked on it (no consequence to me but I can imagine what it was like for the residents below me). -All of the light bulbs used are the lowest wattage possible (there never seemed to be enough light in any room even with all of the fixtures turned on.) -There were only two small waste cans for the entire suite, one next to the toilet and the other hidden in the kitchen pantry. -There was a large walk-in closet for the bedroom but it only came with 12 hangers, and the coat closet in the living room had none. -There were no towel racks in the bathroom. Only a single towel hook next to the shower and a double hook on the door to the toilet. -The bathroom had a standard tub and low-flow showerhead. No water massage. Again, none of the preceding can be considered a significant deficiency (with the possible exception of the WiFi access) when compared to an economy hotel room, but together they present a pervasive air of economy and significantly detract from the overall experience. Especially when compared to similar types of properties in the area at similar prices. Lastly, outside of the suite itself, the bent towards economy and a lack of consideration for the guests continued. One example is that the pool and Jacuzzi were both closed (ostensibly for maintenance) during my stay. A note given to me at registration indicated that they would both be closed from September through November. A friend of mine that lives in the area indicated that this is a frequent tactic used by area hotels so they don\u2019t have to heat their pool facilities in the cold weather. Another example is that the grounds keeping staff decided that they would manicure the rockscape next to the guest\u2019s parking stalls while the guest\u2019s cars were still parked in them, covering them with a thick layer of dust in the process. Normal consideration of the guests would have dictated that the affected stalls be roped off or, at least, the guests warned to move their vehicles. Would I stay there again? Possibly, if no other similar facilities were available (the one I normally stay at was booked). Certainly the price was reasonable (although Expedia indicated that I received a highly discounted rate). And the location is only about 20 minutes from the south end of the strip during rush hour (10 to 15 minutes at less congested times) if that\u2019s your objective. But, given a choice, much better accommodations can be had for the same or even less price.", "Date": "December 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cGreat For Old Folk More like a retirement village than a resort\u201d", "Author": "Traveller2120", "ReviewID": "UR10069336", "Content": "Nice property not far from the strip.

A good place to stay.", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "sacramento", "Title": "\u201cNothing compared to the pictures\u201d", "Author": "travelingmates", "ReviewID": "UR8662492", "Content": "This timeshare was given to us to use and it was not what the pictures they have looked like. The pool area in the pictures they show are not as crisp and gorgeous when you see this place in person. This property was actually an apartment complex and it's not one of their best which they told us at the timeshare presentation, which is a joke. They are in the process of renovating this property but they told us that it's going to be a while. You can see the crackling in the bathroom toilet seats, tubs, etc. Not all cookware was there that was suppose to be there. Not much room to walk in the main master bedroom, I bumped the tv cabinet twice and hit my toe, it's too close to the bed. Adult pool? sure...kids were using it. Clean? yes, but when you try to walk through the pool area to get to the main lobby, you have to walk through everyone's shoes, slippers, towels, toys etc. which could be hazardous because it's not enough room and you could fall into the pool. The presentation manager for the timeshare is the most rudest man on the face of this earth, he was a jerk. I came very close to signing the dotted line but wanted till the end of the day to decide...he just came back to us and cussed at us and said you guys are just here to get the damn free gifts...what freakin gifts? a show ticket, buffet lunch...I could do away with that. I told them at sunterra that i would never ever buy one of their properties. Once you check in, they make you go to the next counter where they talk you into going to the presentation.", "Date": "September 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lalalalal", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "lalalalal", "ReviewID": "UR8538808", "Content": "great location however must rent a car if you choose to be around the strips partylife but a great place nice pool, clean room would def. comeback and stay here or other sunterra resorts", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Iowa", "Title": "\u201cA pleasant surprise\u201d", "Author": "jodebode", "ReviewID": "UR8514701", "Content": "We had purchased a Sunterra Escapes package in March of 2006 and stayed at the Desert Paradise Resort in Las Vegas to use our points. It was our first time in Vegas and we thought the resort was great. It was just my husband and I (both 30). When we booked, all that was left were 2 bedroom suites, so that was what we were given. It was may more space than we needed, but we liked having an extra room to put our luggage in so our room seemed very tidy the whole time. It was great having 2 bathrooms also. Overall, the resort was certainly not 5-star, but it was very nice. The beds were so comfortable! The adult pool and hot tub were not working while we were there which was a little disappointing, but the family pool was great. Being off-strip, we did rent a car and we never had a problem driving through town or finding parking spaces at any of the casinos on the strip. There is a shuttle to the strip from the hotel, but it doesn't run very late at night. Overall, I think this was a great place to stay, very relaxing and affordable. It would be terrific for a family.", "Date": "August 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Elk Grove, CA", "Title": "\u201cOK Stay\u201d", "Author": "Sactown5", "ReviewID": "UR8511656", "Content": "Just got back from a stay at the Desert Paradise Resort. We had a two bedroom unit. Basic unit, but comfortable - including bed. Pool was nice, my children were with us and took advantage of it a few times. They had a big waterfall which was a lot of fun. Had a few relatively minor issues (no batteries in the remote, and garbage disposal that didn't work). However, the property responded quickly when notified of the issues. The property met our needs - nothing more, nothing less. Location was fine. Highly advisable to rent a car however.

You definately need a car, though there is a shuttle for guests (last run is at 10:00 pm). If you want casino action, the Orleans is very close and easy to get to. Upon first glance, the place is great, especially for families. It is like a condo and the units have their own washers/dryers. My stay was clean and comfy... until I saw the gigantic roach running through the living room on my way out the door to check out (I dropped everything, emptied my bags and shook them out!). If that doesn't bother you, then enjoy. But, if you are squeemish like me, then I recommend that you don't unpack and keep everything zipped and off the floor. Beware the timeshare pitch.
