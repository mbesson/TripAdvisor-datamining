This is a amazing hotel with amazing service and amenities. Service: The service here was impeccable. Check in was a a simple process where I was literally treated like I owned the hotel. I was staying in the Gold which has it's own concierge and access to a private lounge. The attendant was very helpful and polite and remembered my name from the start. They must speak with the front desk or something because he addressed me by my name which I never told him minutes after being in the main lobby.. guess it's possible there were not many other guests but I don't think so. Room: You can't beat these rooms. If you want five start amenities this is in. The room is huge for a king size room with a long entrance, huge closet, desk leather eco chair and very stylish furnishings. The bed very extremely comfy and I never wanted to get up for work. The bathroom was very well layer out with a huge shower and separate toilet area. The toiletries where top notch and all wonderful. I liked the fully stocked mini bar and snacks as I sometimes like a drink in the room or snack before bed. tsk tsp right.. Oh! and please don't be alarmed when you get to your room and the lights are dimmed and the music is playing.. there is no one in the room I swear. It's just the turn down service.. But the Music was so loud I felt bad for the neighbors. Spaces: I used the lounge for work and play. My manager and myself would go to the horderves after we finished working and before dinner. The food was amazing with cheese and salmi and many other items that changes every day including hot sandwiches and sliders one day. They coffee is Nestle and Illy which were both amazing. There is off course a full service honor bar which had tons of options. If you do not know how to make a drink they attendant did offer to help. We also had breakfast in the lounge every morning which was again very tasty. hey had fresh juice which was to die for. Near by: We at at Bricco one night which was to die for. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are in the area. I had a seafood risotto which was amazing and fresh. We also at at a sushi place but the name escapes me right now. But the Sushi was amazing and I am a huge sushi fan. Overall: I would highly recommend this hotel for it's service and small touches that make you feel like your at home. PS. Enjoy a nice drink in front of the fire places in the lounge it is very relaxing.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx, New York", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "T S", "ReviewID": "UR125472288", "Content": "I can't wait to go back to the Fairmont Batter Wharf!

Unfortunately, when I opened the window, I looked directly into a \"yacht\" where the owner was having breakfast. No privacy. I had to keep my shades closed for most of the time. Also, the only way to get from the Hotel to the Spa is a brief walk outside. Not a problem, except when it is 8 degrees out and you are wearing shorts. The work-out facility was very good. The location of the hotel was well situated for the North End, but not anywhere near where I needed to be. It is essentially in a mixed use residential section of town.

We got an amazing rate through Priceline. It has been my experience that when you get such a great deal on price the experience is not always the best but that was certainly not the case at this hotel. Upon arrival we were greeted by a wonderful staff. The valet, the bellhop and the front desk were all so professional and welcoming. The check-in process was flawless. The man checking us in (Ricky?) was friendly, upbeat, engaging and helpful. When I was greeted with his upbeat demeanor I told him I was so glad to be there, and to have such a nice reception, as my day was not going so well. A normal response from any other hotel would be, \"I am sorry to hear that.\" But instead he asked, \"Why? What happened?\" And I found myself telling him! That is how welcome he made me feel. He then offered my husband and me a drink at the hotel restaurant on the house. Seriously, Can't remember when I have had such a lovely check in. When we got to our beautiful room (that was located in the main building) there was a pastry box, filled with specialty biscotti from a North End bakery, waiting for my husband with a personalized birthday note from the hotel. My daughter was thrilled! The decor of our room was stylish and modern and we had a very nice view. Everything was immaculate and the bathtub looked very inviting (I am not one to use the hotel bathtub but this one was immaculate). The location cannot be beat and have I told you how amazing the staff is? The one down side is that there is no pool so my daughter was a bit disappointed.

Location: perfect. 5 minute walk to the countless Italian restaurants in the North End of Boston (very nice neighborhood - feel safe walking around all hours of the night). 10 minute walk to Faneuill Hall/Quincy Market/Freedom Trail and other main historical attractions. 15 minute walk to TD Garden where the Bruins/Celtics play. $6 taxi ride to other area attractions. Staff: young, attractive and very helpful! They were very willing to help us with area restaurants and the touring plans. Housekeeping does a nice turndown service too (replaces towels, turns down the blankets, fills the ice chest, and sets the music low for a relaxing return from a day of touring). Rooms: modern and contemporary. Most Fairmonts have a traditional or Victorian-ish theme, but not the Battery Wharf. Leather bed frames, contempory art, super comfortable mattresses, modern fixtures, huge flat screen and sci-fi touchscreen telephone that gives you the weather and other tips. Room is a bit small but met our needs perfectly. We loved our room. Restaurant at Hotel: seemed crowded each night but we didn't stop in. Cost: Fairmonts are usually a bit expensive but generally worth the extra cost. Battery Wharf is no different. 150 rooms with partial water views. Hotel is on the first two floors of the building while high-end residences take up the top 6 floors. Negatives: rooms in the basic category are a bit small and the closet is very tiny.

(Check in time is 3. We arrived at 3:15 and the room wasn't ready until 3:50). We were not wowed, at all, with the atmosphere of the lobby. It felt very cold and corporate. The hotel has rooms in different buildings and feels disconnected. It reminded me of being on a business trip and staying in a business owned, tiny condo. Our room was small, impersonal, and although the hotel is fairly new, it still felt worn. We got to the room to discover there was no bath tub - a huge disappointment for me. When we asked the front desk we were told that most rooms do not have tubs and it would have been an extra $300 to get a suite which had one!! Also the room was really small. I know we were in a city but it still felt unusually cramped. The rooms did have robes but they were thin, scratchy and unappealing. The best part of the hotel was the bedding.

I have only ever stayed at Fairmonts older properties in Canada and the States, so I thought id get a more modern version of there signature style and service. I was very much mistaken. Guess this proves that new does not mean better. Yes superficially this is ultra sleek and new hotel looks promising but as soon as I made my way to check-in the bubble burst. I came in the morning and being booked into the gold floor I asked the bellman where to go, the answer the checkin desk, after queuing for 15 minutes with luggage in hand I was told that the gold floor was a separate building. Without even an offer to help transfer my bags I was told to proceed diagonally across the square to check in there. Upon arriving (still with luggage) there door would not open, and there wasn't even so much as a 'ring for assistance' button or phone. Not starting out so well. After finally receiving help from a very nice receptionist I finally made it to my room. The rest of the stay was uneventful. The building and rooms were nice with a very residential feel to them. Modern decor and amenities, especially compared to the Fairmont I know. Despite the young age and look to the hotel everything seemed to be well worn, wall paper scratched and paint that was chipping away covered up with paint (though not quite the same colour.) There restaurant onsite is a real treat. Italian food meets boston american, chowder and truffle pasta on the same menu. It was very nice and service was A1, for North America. Sat at the chefs counter (bar style seating on the hotplate, so you can observe the chefs team preparing orders). There executive chef was even so nice as to show me the way (personally) to the toilets. Only slight criticism maybe is that there portions were HUGE. Checkout had to have been the strangest I ever experienced. I presented my self downstairs and couldn't find a soul in sight. Finally when I saw what appeared to be a staff member (wearing a sweatshirt) I asked if I could check out, she said its all been sorted and told me to go across to catch a taxi, if I needed it. From check in to check out the hotel seems to be (besides the restaurant) run by staff that have no idea what customer service is supposed to be in a 5 star hotel, certainly not what I expect from Fairmont.

Very friendly staff; we were greeted immediately by the valet attendant and bellman as soon as we opened the car doors. Check in was quick and courteous, with the desk staff offering area maps and recommendations for dinner in the North End. We'd pre-purchased a king deluxe harborview room at a discounted rate, and I was pleased that we were still treated warmly on check-in. This is a multi-building low rise property at the northern end of the harbor. Building 3 contains the lobby, restaurant and guest rooms; we had room 3136 which did indeed have a lovely view of the harbor looking south. (The first digit of the room numbers indicates the building, with the 3 remaining digits being the room number.) This room is close to the end of the building and as such was very quiet. Room decor was modern/Asian, with muted colors and expansive wood. Very comfortable pillow-top king bed with duvet and extra pillows. Small writing desk with wired internet also had excellent wireless signal. Join the Fairmont Presidents Club (it's free) to get free Internet service - unusual for the downtown luxury hotels. Very large wall mounted flat screen TV had a superb picture and an astounding number of channels, many in HD, from Dish Network (first time I've ever had Al Jazeera in a US hotel.) Nespesso coffee maker looked interesting but with the North End next door, went unused. The room was large and comfortable, with a leather recliner by the window - good for gazing at the harbor ferries. Bath was spacious but take note: rainforest shower (along with a standard showerhead) only - no bathtub. Towels were surprisingly average; not large and fluffy as I'd expected from an otherwise well-appointed room. And towel racks were located under the sink, which required bending down to grab hand and bath towels - might have been in an accessible room, but had no indication of it. Sink was one of those Kohler trendy flat basins that look great dry, but add water and a serious flood ensues, no matter how cautious one tries to be. One cool feature: the closet is accessible from inside the bathroom as well as the room's entrance. We did not use the bathrobes, but they did look presidential. The entire room was spotlessly clean.They did turndown service while we were out for dinner, which we didn't expect, but was a nice touch. The North End is a 2 minute walk and there are dozens of great places for dinner on Hanover St, Salem St and the many side streets. Peek in the windows to check the atmosphere (and potential wait), read the menu posted outside and pick your favorite, It's hard to go wrong. We ate at Rabia's on Salem, where we'd had nice meals on previous getaways, and had lovely meals in a quiet atmosphere. We did decide to have an expensive hotel breakfast at Aragosta, the hotel restaurant, and were blown away by the food. Yeah, it was expensive ($9-15 entrees), but was quite possibly the best breakfast out I've ever had. The service was also excellent, with the hotel manager supplementing the waitstaff without needing to (the two of us and a family of 6 were the only guests.) They offer healthy options (gluten-free, low carb, raw food) as well as standard fare. We enjoyed Bircher Muesli with sliced apple and banana, and crepes with scrambled eggs, chives, greyere cheese and creme fraiche. And excellent coffee too. Fabulous! Other things of note: We received a $25 coupon for spa treatments at check-in, but sadly, did not use it. We did visit the \"Maritime Museum\" located at ground level in the building directly across from the restaurant. The photos and description of the history of Battery Wharf and the vicinity are nicely presented, very interesting and worth 10-15 minutes to read. If it's 4 degrees like it is now, use the underground passageways linking the buildings to get there. Good points: harbor location close to North End, warm, efficient service, large rooms, comfortable beds, great view of Boston Harbor, excellent restaurant, good winter value compared with the other Boston Harbor hotels. Not so good: Valet parking is $42 and they ask for 30 minutes' notice to retrieve your car (ours was ready in 10 minutes but it was very quiet at the hotel.) Very few cheap breakfast options nearby on weekdays. First floor rooms are less private than upper floors as the Harborwalk runs all the way around the hotel (joggers, walkers etc. although during winter it's less of a concern.) If you want to keep the curtains open, don't take the first floor. The not so good points, however, were minor. We loved this hotel - the room, service and location exceeded our expectations.

Also, any doors slamming in the hall can be heard too. The staff were very friendly. When their marketing manager saw on Twitter that I was staying there and looking forward to sampling some 'chowdah', she sent a personalised card and map, noting the four best restaurants for chowder. Really nice touch. The staff at the front desk were quick and efficient, and happy to chat about restaurant questions I had, and to find out how our days went and what we got up to. As I said, overall, it was fantastic, except for the thin walls. Despite that, I'd still recommend it.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silicon Valley", "Title": "\u201cModern Hotel Near the North End\u201d", "Author": "NDGirlInCali", "ReviewID": "UR122441666", "Content": "This hotel is fairly new and quite modern compared to most of the other hotels in Boston and divided in to several buildings. It is located in the North End just a short distance from quaint cobblestone streets and fantastic Italian restaurants. Quincy Market is also a short walk away and do-able even in the bitter cold! The check-in and other services were fine although we are pretty low maintenance and pretty much just check-in and check-out. My husband and I stayed in a standard room and since I had to work, made use of the nice desk and high-speed internet. While I have read that people would rather have a coffee machine rather than an espresso machine, you can just use the \"espresso\" pack and select the larger cup size for a \"coffee\" instead of an espresso. The room layout (especially the bathroom) is quite clever. The toilet is ensconced in opaque glass next to the shower. The doors to both have towel racks maximizing space. The closets in the hallway also open up in the bathroom which is pretty clever. Also, antiquated phone in toilet (weird!) and TV speaker in bathroom which would be nice for business travelers. The lighting in the bathroom is FANTASTIC! A few gripes. The relative lack of privacy of the bathroom. This is a personal preference but I have noticed that many modern hotels use sliding doors for the bathroom (W in Time Square NYC and AVIA in Napa Valley) which I am not a fan of. Also, no tub in the standard room. While parking fees are standard in any major urban hotel it still irritates me. You have to build in an extra $42 per day cost to the hotel. If we were just staying in Boston we would not rent a car but we were traveling all over New England and had to valet. The gym, located in the hotel's spa, is pretty decent by hotel standards and have treadmills (with TV), bikes, free weights, Swiss ball, Kettle Balls, and a few weight machines. The treadmills were on pads to minimize noise and vibration but resulted in wobbliness. I couldn't even run on one for fear of twisting an ankle.

I therefore brought my older pickup truck. When I arrived at the Fairmont, the valet repeatedly asked me to use a local parking garage instead of using the hotel's valet service. On my insistence, the valet finally agreed to do his job. The rooms were so poorly constructed that anytime a guest closed their door, the walls shook, which also vibrated our door. This occurred throughout the night. There is very poor insulation between rooms, so I had the pleasure of listening to all that entails, including the apparent chest cold of the woman next door. (I went for NY eve celebrations, so I was not looking for silence, often returning to the room sometime after 2 a.m.) I brought the valet and noise issues to the attention of the front desk who replied, \"Yes, we have gotten a lot of those complaints.\" I have stayed in cheap motels that left the light on for me which had better staff.

The view from the room was amazing overlooking the water. So peaceful and serene. The bed was very firm but, not hard.

The mini-bar was stocked with top shelf liquor and snacks. I wasn't a fan of the espresso machine as most people just like plain old coffee. The room was very clean and nice with glasses rather than those yucky plastic coups you get at the Westin and other hotels that claim to be four stars. The bathroom was very large but, only had a shower (I'm a bath person) and I was told only the doubles had soak tubs? WHAT?!?!?!?! That was pretty disappointing but the bathrobes were nice, fluffy and clean. The staff was helpful and friendly but, I think the doormen could have been better about opening the doors rather than \"hanging out\" talking to their colleagues or other guests. There was an amazing jazz singer that performed in the lobby and that was a VERY NICE surprise as I didn't have to venture out to be entertained. The hotel staff front desk staff overall was friendly and very professional. They provided the the four-five star service you expect from the Fairmont. The only thing I didn't like is they did a \"soft charge\" to my card although I had already paid with Expedia online, it was called a \"credit check\"? HUH? Anyway, I would have to say overall I LOVED the Fairmont and would definitely stay here again as it right on the water and right at the North End which has nice little shops and spas. I say avoid the SPA if you are expecting friendly staff as I went there twice and not one time did the four women at the desk say hello. The SPA is nice and sells great clothing for yoga, lounging, etc. The restaurant menu is a bit pricey for \"ok\" dinner menu but the BREAKFAST WAS AMAZING!!! YUMMY!

We also had the Fairmont order specific beers from our hometowns that aren't normally offered at the hotel. The cake was beautifully displayed on a modern looking display in the ballroom. We also took advantage of the flat panels in the ballroom to display personalized slide shows that helped add an extra pop to the room.

The only other annoying point was the free Wifi. I signed up to their loyalty program specifically to make use of it but only one person could use it at any one time and you had to sign up again to use it at 24 hour intervals. I would have though standard free Wifi for however long you want it for would be pretty standard these days. We also had the experience of a fire alarm going off during our stay, apparantly for no reason, which was slightly unnerving, particulary as I was alseep at the time.

This was one of the best hotel experiences I've had in a very long time. We got the Junior Suite (about 575 square feet) and it was VERY reasonably priced. In fact it was almost the same price as a standard room at a hotel downtown. The room was spotless and beautifully decorated. Not only was the bathroom squeaky clean, it was huge! It was exactly like a Japanese style bathroom, in the sense that the toilet was in a separate \"room\", and the shower/bath had it's own \"room\". The tub was deep and perfect for my two small kids. Once they finished their bath, they were able to get out of the tub and get rinsed off in the shower area. There was just so much space! The bed was very comfortable and had a lot of nice conveniences, like a reading light on each side. Even the crib for my son was quite large and nice. This particular Fairmont was opened in 2008, so this is probably why everything looked so brand new. Location, location, location. I love the fact that it's a little bit outside the chaos of downtown (yet it's still a convenient 5-10 minute drive away). But there are plenty of things to do/see within walking distance, like the New England Aquarium. Plus it's nice that it's by the water because the views were amazing and it was very quiet at night.

Second, I had been told to book my water taxi to Logan airport through the front desk, which I did. Ten minutes after my scheduled departure time, however, when a water taxi finally showed up, he said that he didn't have a booking for me, and therefore couldn't take me.

For example, the bathrooms have sliding doors with no stops so they tend to slam noisily when opened. Similarly the glass-paneled toilet and shower doors also tended to clang shut. We had two rooms, with connecting doors, but the hotel did not have any way to keep the door opened and the desk staff appear flummoxed by our requested for door stops. We noticed the guests across the hall were using pillows to keep their doors open; we employed hangers.

One afternoon was here after a long walk along Boston's harbor waterfront ... the Lobster/WhiteBeanPuree/Crostini was delicious! So fresh and light, the crostini crispy through, no rubbery chewy quality that can happen if unattended, and no charred spots if unattended too long. Loaded with lobster and the white bean puree, such a modern take on the New England/Atlantic Navy Bean tradition. Returned a few days later for weekend brunch. Got the typical Eggs Benedict, but the Aragosta made it great! No mass-produced Canadian Bacon but a generous amount of delicately thin sliced Vermont Ham, the best English Muffin imaginable, the eggs perfectly poached and a delicate Hollandaise sauce. They took typical and made it special! Wish the waterfront views were a bit more scenic ... but still nicer than the typical 'indoor' restaurant.

I was greeted by a lady with a huge smile, who was welcoming and friendly and helpful. Not only did she check me in with expedience, but showed me right to my room, which yes was close by, but the extra step of her showing me the room and telling me how every thing worked, was just an extra special touch. That night another person helped me get my boarding passes for the next morning and was just as friendly. Score huge points for stepping into a place and feeling very welcomed. To the manager here, you have a great crew. We didn't take them up on their huge discount for the restaurant, but if I were staying another night, I would have. All in all, as a hotel, it was gorgeous. As much as I am a dog lover, some one was inconsiderate enough to either leave their dog there alone as he/she barked for quite a while. I think it is great that hotels offer pets a place to stay, but guests can't expect it to be like a kennel and simply leave them alone. Either that or they snuck him/her in! But even that, I would give this hotel the highest marks all around.

First they just can't get the front of the house right and after meeting one of the \"managers\" this is not a surprise. I was traveling with my elderly (but with it) mother. Upon arrival-no help out front with bags (in the pouring rain). Ck in and get to room. Mother is diabetic so need fridge to store meds. Fridge totally empty. Call front desk to have it stocked-this takes two hours and 4 phone calls. However get back to room after dinner and fridge not working-not cold at all. Issue never gets resolved. Have early flight in the morning so use the express breakfast card to order so mother can have something to eat before we leave-card has spot to pick time for delivery. Pick the 6:15am to 6:30am slot. 6:35am no food. Call the front desk and told that the delivery person (only one???) does not get in until 6:30-was late but will start delivery. Why do you offer a 6:15-6:30 time when the person is not there to deliver. 6:50am-no food and have to head to airport. Go to desk to check out and again explain how poor this stay has been. No help from desk person so ask for card so I can contact the manager. Love this part-desk person yells to back office \"Megan can I have one of your cards\" . Megan yells \"sure\" does not ask why, can she be of service-NOTHING. Just says do you want the directors card? and gives me that. Great manager! These are not new problems with this hotel. I have been staying at this hotel since it re-opened and they keep breaking my heart. Love the location etc but it is time to find another favorite and there are plenty to choose from in Boston.

I traveled with my son for 4 days to Boston to see the freedom trail/monuments etc. The Boston Bairmont Battery Wharf had such good reviews I felt we couldn't go wrong. Here are some problems we noticed. - If you think you are paying for a Harbor View Room you are likely paying for a water view room. We ended up with a view of the wharf and a very heavy sales pitch to upgrade to a nice view of the harbor. Of course that would be another $70. Anyways our harborview room ended up being a view of the coast guard station, no harbor at all. So beware if you think you are getting a view of the harbor. - Room Service - Food is really really bad and very expensive. The first night we ordered two meals and I received the wrong meal. I ordered the lobster club and was given a lobster roll. I told her this was incorrect, and she said this is what the lobster club looks like now. Unbelievable. - Bathroom - The bathrooms are nice however ours had a few problems. Our sink faucet literally lifted out of the marble countertop every time you used it. Also there were not many bath products (1 soap, 1 shampoo, 1 conditioner). - Restaurant - \"Sensing\" is the name of the restaurant. The first morning we dined at sensing, the food was pretty good. They serve your breakfast with a unripened tomato with a strange green topping. Tried it twice and YUCK! They also serve your breakfast with carrots and asparagus (COLD). The bread is also very bad. Servers look very unhappy and understaffed. That night we tried having in room dining but I was put on hold and staff never picked up the call again. So we walked down to the restaurant and there was no hostess to seat us. We kept waiting and nobody helped us so we returned to the restaurant in an hour and waited to be seated again. We caught the attention of a waitress, asked if there was a hostess who could seat us and she said the hostess is sick tonight and didn't offer to seat us! We went back to our room and finally got through to room service to order two hamburgers. So here is the funny part. No bottle opener was delivered for my diet coke. I called room service and they said someone would deliver one right away. Never came. I went out to the desk after all my ice had melted and they said they are running very low on bottle openers and she would go get her car keys! OMG! Is this really a hotel? - The noise - When we arrived there was a dog barking out side our window once an hour every hour. Also when the neighbors are using the bathroom is it very very loud.

The Boston harbor suites are ideal for meetings, small get togethers , or that pre wedding reception. The patio space is phenomenal for lounging on a summer afternoon with a cold beer !

I decided to try it, though I usually stay elsewhere when I am in Boston. Let me cut to the quick: 1. Hotel has very big rooms and bathrooms (marble) 2. This is absolutely \"no frills\" though it is clean and modern. Very masculine. 3. I can't tell you about the \"bar\" or \"restaurant\" personally, as I was not even interested looking for it. 4. This hotel was made for a businessman's trip. Women, go elsewhere. 5. You will probably not stay where there is a front desk, bar, or restaurant in your building. There are 4 different buildings and the 1st and 2nd floor are the hotel rooms. Of course there is no ice machine, so one must wait for room service from another building to bring you ice. 6. Be prepared to direct every taxi to your hotel, as no one appears to know where this hotel is, though it has been opened for 2 years. 7. The hotel has no concierge, as they will tell you that all that work at the desk are the \"concierge\" 8. If you need a cab fast, you are out of luck 9. Better know where you are going in the North End, (which is basically where the hotel is), because believe me, no one at the hotel knows where anything is. 10. If you want to see Boston for vacation reasons, avoid this hotel, as you really pretty much already need to know what there is and how to get there. 11. Room service breakfast sucks. Pancakes were heavy and ice water must be asked for. 12. Hotel is not near anything, but would really be ideal for hiding out, in case you ever want to. (This is why taxis cost more than you will ever spend anywhere else in Boston) 13. Restaurant menu at the hotel, \"Sensing\" looks like an overpriced 1990's menu.

I had also spoken with a few people who had been upgraded to the Gold building as a matter of course and who were not a gold member and as we were three adults it would have been good to have more space available to us but we booked through Expedia as a last minute booking and have heard that unless you book directly with the hotel then these 'specials' are not likely to happen.", "Date": "September 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maryland", "Title": "\u201cA truly wonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "gks", "ReviewID": "UR77652390", "Content": "On a recent trip to Boston, I had the absolute pleasure of staying at this property. I had booked through Fairmonts Central Reservations but later called the hotel directly to ask a question. I am thrilled I made that call. A Fairmont Gold representative, Ishan, answered. After chatting and gaining more information I chose to upgrade to the \"Gold\" building, a wonderful decision. Upon check-in we were escorted to the separate building, by a very knowledgeable and friendly staff member. Check in was seamless, and our room was a lovely corner room. I had booked a harbor view in the main building, and while this room did indeed have an appealing view, it's not harbor front. Nonetheless, the room, decor, and bathroom, were all lovely. The linens were top quality and beds were very comfortable. The recliner might be the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in. The large (functioning) windows were delightful and made the already spacious room that much more enjoyable. A flat screen, coffee/espresso machine, well stocked mini-bar, and ample seating, were also enjoyed. Over the weekend we took great advantage of the lounge and it's patio area. The meals/snacks and drinks were all top notch and the entire area was spotless and meticulously maintained by the gold staff members. Although we found later that the hotel was full, the lounge was never crowded and the offerings were creative and plentiful. In closing I will say what made the stay at the Fairmont truly memorable was the staff. Ishan Johnson is a gem. Attentive, professional, caring and very concerned with his guests comfort and happiness. Ishan, Johnathan Greenberg, and indeed all the staff we had the pleasure of dealing with were beyond compare. Certainly when we return to Boston, this will be our only choice for accommodations. Pros: Location, location, location! The close proximity to ample attractions and restaurants made it perfect for a base point. Lovely harbor front location, and very short ride to/from the airport. Decor, comfort and amenities. First class. Staff, simply beyond compare! Cons: No bedside alarm clock nor i-pod docking station. A trivial complaint and almost not worth mentioning. The flat screen is fixed and wall mounted, making it difficult to view from the bed(s).

It was nice and quiet and peaceful. I took a nap almost every other day. The upside to this hotel is being near the North End where it's safe and has great food. Be prepared to eat your way through the North End and love the nightlife on the weekends. There are few downsides to this hotel (but these are easily worked around): First, parking is very expensive. Solve this by parking down the street where prices are less in other lots. Next, this hotel is not very close to the public transportation, however it only takes about 15 minutes to walk there. So, if you're like most Americans you need the exercise anyhow.

Most of my friends stayed downtown near Copley which I have done in the past until I discovered this hotel last year simply by just walking by. The staff at the Fairmont Battery Wharf in every department are so amazing - no task or request is too great and is done with such willingness. The rooms are large and spotless and so modern, The linens on the bed are to die for. Makes sleeping a real luxury. Closet space - you could bring your wardrobe from home and fit it all in. I had just a regular room. When you check in they make sure all your requirements are met. They had on Sunday and Monday a Grab and Go breakfast for runners starting at 5:30am - it was top notch and as a runner you could not have asked for more nutritional food - if you were in a hurry they had bags and cutlery so you could eat on the run so to speak. The dining room unfortunately I was only able to eat a sit down breakfast days prior to the race but from what I hear I really missed out on the dinner menu. Next year for sure- I have already made my reservation for next April. If you are attending a Celtics or Bruins game you can walk - 10 minutes away. If you need the underground there are two stops I prefer the wharf walk cause you pass a Starbucks and you get to walk along the water the whole time. Very close to all those great Italian restaurants in the North End - and very close to Quincy Market - I must mention that while during my stay I became extremely sick with Sinusitus and needed a Doctor. I phoned the reception at 1AM on Sunday and was given the best treatment by the staff- by 7:30AM I was all fixed up with a Dr and given a prescription at CVS on Bolyston Street which I picked up that morning. Without the help and knowledge of the staff at the Fairmont Battery Wharf as who to turn to I may have had to withdraw from the Marathon - I am so very grateful for their assistance and it is very comforting to know that they have their guests best interests truly at heart.

On arrival, we were stuck outside the Gold Building for almost 10 minutes as the door was locked, no one answered our knocks, no doorbell to be found. We finally found a valet housephone and got the receptionist at the other building. It appears there were two people who were supposed to be at the Gold Desk but no-one knew where they were. The room itself is standard for hotel rooms of this category: large flat screen tv, html-enabled Cisco phone (don't try for news or you'll end up with just html coding....), comfy bed. The lag-bolts were coming out of the shower wall for the hand-held spray..that surprised us. They might use these rooms for presentations/revenue sources as there was a large closed round electrical inlet protruding in the middle of the room which we kept tripping over(check out the picture we uploaded). The pre-dinner Gold offerings were minimal: one sealed bottle of red wine, no opener, two bottles with less than one ounce in them, and chunks of dry corned beef on a hot plate, small dishes of pasta salad. There was mustard, olives but no bread or napkins. Small cubes of cheese floated in olive oil. We initially thought they were going lean perhaps for a low booking night, but later were told they were full up, so not sure why so skimpy/sloppy on the lay-out. Morningtime, our shoes had been taken for cleaning overnight but never re-appeared and there was no answer at the Gold Concierge. The Receptionist in the main building said he'd find the shoes..called back in 20 min to say they would be ready soon but we were hungry and went down to breakfast in slippers. Unlike other Fairmonts, the Gold Lounge here only offers an \"enhanced\" Continental breakfast: oatmeal was the only hot option. They were out of orange juice (we were there at opening time) but the Concierge did find one glass for us. There were only a few croissants, some bagels...so much for the Italian bakeries near by. Our shoes, btw, arrived during the breakfast..about an hour after the Receptionist said they'd be ready. The location in the North End is good...no other hotel too close by..and you can watch Logan takeoffs and landings (just not from your Gold Building view). On other notes, the roses I had ordered over the phone from the Gold Concierge for my wife were delivered without the message card, and the Wifi signal was so weak it was mostly unusable esp considering the cumbermore multi-screen billing procedures to go through (even for alleged free Gold Wifi). The hotel has its own merit and of course the staff mostly seems to try and offer a good service but hard to give them credit when many such \"merits\" are expected in hotels of this category...I'd just point out here that unlike any other Gold offering in the Fairmont chain, I don't think it's worth it here.", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cValentines Day 2010\u201d", "Author": "Sarnie_M", "ReviewID": "UR56063227", "Content": "I stayed here for Valentines Day 2010.

If you get a harbor view, or are lucky enough to get one of the suites at the end of the hotel, the sunrise is amazing and it has an incredible ambiance. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel itself is extremely clean, brand new, and everything you'd expect from a Fairmont.

The food at Sensing was great (brunch). Now the bad...one of our family members had a double lung transplant and we were celebrating his life and our ability to ring in 2010 together. We had a group of younger women in the room next to us smoking (yes, the entire hotel is non-smoking, but some people care only about themselves--they even had a balcony in the harbor suite they were staying in). When we smelled smoke the first time, we called the front desk. Response was that they were addressing it with the occupants and if they received additional complaints, they would move the offenders. I know that was not the only complaint. We'll this continued throughout the wee hours of the morning (when you don't want to move your own room) and each time hotel staff addressed with the offenders, but never moved the group as promised. A sleepless night was the least of our concerns-- we were mainly concerned with the damage to our family member's lungs.

Even forgot a couple of things in the car - asked the 1st staffer we saw for help - he brought us underground, moved another vehicle to get mine off a lift - and did it with a smile. Parking was around $40/day and was added to the tab - by Boston standards, the room and parking charges were very fair for what you got. Only other critical points would be that our king had a shower only - it was a beautiful shower, but no place to soak - this was surprising for such a high-end property, but they did tell me in advance when I made reservations.

We were able to stroll around the wharf at night. It was beautiful! We stayed in a Gold Level room, which in this case, is actually a seperate building!

We used it to get where we needed to go each time, and then worked out way back. I am not sure why other reviews were so negative.

I suffer from early morning insomnia, and one early morning I was walking into the lobby just as an employee was about to vacuum. Not only did he put his vacuum away so as not to disturb me, but he also brought me a nice carafe of coffee.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel, neighboorhood, and city\u201d", "Author": "TravelgirlLouisiana", "ReviewID": "UR40212007", "Content": "We stayed here over Labor Day weekend. We liked the hotel overall. It's of course relatively new, so there were a lot of nice features like 42 inch. LCD television, rainshower features in glass enclosed stall, etc. We really liked the neighborhood, though would probably consider staying in the Back Bay area if traveling to Boston during colder months as that neighborhood would be more central. The key to the North End is the proximity to the water and charm of all of the Italian restaurants on Hanover Street. Definitely agree with the comments made by previous reviewers regarding some apparent inexperience on the part of the front desk staff and valet personnel. It's not that some of them were downright rude, it was that there were a lot of twenty-something year old male employees who seemed more interested in chatting and joking with one another than acknowledging or warmly addressing the guests. I think they would be well served to hire some more experienced employees to man the front desk. There are no pool or spa facilities at this hotel. Very strange as the spa is one of the highest revenue part of a hotel. An employee said that a spa is in the works, though I saw no sign of such. Boston recommendations: Freedom Trail walk through Freedom Trail Foundation, explore Beacon Hill brownstone lined streets, and try Stregu and Sensing restaurants, the latter being in the hotel. While Sensing at first blush seems very expensive and not very timely for its luxurious menu in these times of economic uncertainty, you can go there just for dessert (try the pistachio macaroon) or have a burger. It doesn't have to cost you $300 if you plan accordingly.", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cGreat room and views!!\u201d", "Author": "biggie76Toronto", "ReviewID": "UR39829128", "Content": "overall, great hotel, awesome room, bed is great and comfy....washrooms are very unique and clean.

The room was very comfortable, with a big TV, nice bathroom, big bed and good linens. The housekeeping staff was not very attentive (forgot to refill milks, tookaway shower cap without replacing it). Try to get a room on the second floor, as the first floor does not feel very private, with the seawall just outside the window. Fairmont offers free HighSpeed, but only to members of their (free) President's Club The North End is, in my opinion, the best place to stay in Boston. Lots of street scenes, great restaurants, beautiful water views. It is only 10 minutes to downtown and the Metro, so that is not bad.

For that price, this was a perfect hotel for us. For the published price on the website, this hotel is overpriced. A bit ouside of the hecticness, the hotel is very new and clean. It can be reached on foot from downtown as Boston is pretty small and we walked to most places, but if you are dependant on public transport to get around, a more central hotel may be better - The nearest \"T\" train station is a ten minute fast walk away. On the plus side, the room and the bathroom area were spacious, and the bed & pillows were really comfortable. We had a harbour view, which was great, but many rooms face adjacent buildings. We found our room very quiet and the staff were helpful. As some other reviewers have said, many of the staff seem young and quite inexperienced- many looked like college kids in an oversized uniform. The hotel comprises of several buildings and the gym, although it is open 24h is in a separate building next door.

We ate all meals out , so cannot comment on food. Not too far a walk to get to Mikes for pastry or to Pizzeria Regina.

When I arrived by water taxi there was a front desk agent there to assist me with luggage and bring me to the front desk. This is were I met another agent named Daniel. (be sure to ask for him if you visit this hotel) He was one of the youngest but most informative and helpful rep. I have ever encountered throughout my traveling lifestyle. He noticed I was paying with my American Express Platinum card and began talking about all of the Perks and benefits the card has and how I can use it for other Fairmont property's. (Theirs a lot of travel benefits i didn't even know about) After being checked In, he escorted me to my room. I was in a different building from where the lobby was located (liked it better than I thought I would) Room #138. He took his time and showed me all of the features to the room, which made me feel that much more at home. Explaining everything from how to turn on the AC to how to disable my own doorbell (hehe) The room itself was just lovely, everything was clean, modern but incorporating a true warm feeling to the room. HOWEVER there was one major problem with my room..... The carpet was soaked after I took a shower. I called the front desk and a lady informed me that she was aware of the problem, which was confusing why they would check people into this room with that knowledge? I had a fantastic lunch at there Asian restaurant called Sensing. Daniel saw me in the restaurant and stopped by to check in on me, and how my stay was. I told him how much I loved the new Hotel however I was disliking my soaked carpet..... He told me not to worry about! He moved me to a different room on the second floor, moved my luggage for me and on top of that, he even included a continental breakfast for me the morning of my flight, all while I was still sitting down with my colleagues eating lunch. Overall I was extremely impressed by all of the Front Desk agents assistance, they were great in the morning getting me all of my directions, and made my check out a quick, thorough and prompt transaction. I would highly recommend this hotel to any families or business travelers who will be in the Financial district. P.s.
