The bartender from Hawaii (I can't remember his name) even recommended the best pizza rest. locally. Amazing service - this is really a Best Western Premier in my opinion. Very nice stay. The breakfast was also outstanding, very good. The view of the Space Needle is show stopper amazing!

We had booked 2 rooms for a party of 4, from a well known travel site for one night on our way back from or trip to Florida . I had paid for the rooms via this travel site well before we left on our holiday And up to that point the holiday was perfect... then The Best Western incident happened. We had arrived in Seattle after flying back from Florida around 11pm and was looking forward to a nice sleep at what looked like a very nice hotel, from what I saw from the hotel's website and was rated very high for its rooms and beds, which is what someone looks forward to after 8 hours in flight ,we also had to catch the Amtrak train back to Vancouver B.C @ 7:40am the next morning. When we arrived at the hotel from the airport the limo driver unloaded our bags as we had 8 bags between the 4 of us and and we put them on the ground and waited for a bellman who never came. I sent my wife,daughter and mother into the lobby as I dealt with the bags on the ground. when I did walk in and talked with desk staff the lady there looked at me strangely and informed me that the staff before her shift had given our rooms to another party ,even though my credit card was the one on file. She then asked me for ID to prove to her who I was. I suggested that they might have done that to the party who they had given our rooms too, and then asked how this could happen when the names given by the party that occupied our paid rooms did not even come close to our parties name. The front desk just looked at me , my 79 year old mother and wife and daughter and apologized for the mix up. When we asked for replacement rooms they told us that they had none. Wonderful stuck in Seattle and it is now after midnight, I asked the staff what they were going to do and they told us they would set us up in their sister hotel. What a joke that was, we loaded our bags ourselves into a taxi that would not even get out of the car and was taken over to the sister hotel called the Six Avenue Inn, which looked like a run down back alley motel, which had a stench of stale beer in the stained carpeted lobby .with the local homeless sleeping in the lobby. We were appalled and refused to stay in such a run down place after what we had booked at the best western plus executive inn on 200 Taylor Ave. By 2am they agreed to set us up at local Holiday inn express and we agreed after they told us they would cover the competitor's hotel cost for the inconvenience . The Holiday inn was a nice experience as their staff was very accommodating. Since that horrible night at the best western, I have contacted the travel website 3 times in the last 8 days and they tried to contact the hotel To remedy the ordeal,each time the contacted the hotel they were told the manager was unavailable and to try back,one travel customer service person told me that they we even hung up on as they tried to call back a second time. I know i have rambled on but if I can save one person from this disaster I will be satisfied that Best Western does not get a chance to do this to someone else who pays in advance and still gets the worst customer service i ever had experienced. By the way ,when we got to our Holiday Inn rooms it was around 3am so i sat up in my bed and clock watched for 5am to come so we could catch our train home. We still are waiting for best western to fix this problem, even though we received a nice email from head office saying that they will be in touch that was 8 days ago. I suggest trying one of the other chains of hotels in Seattle to avoid this happening to your family.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poulsbo, Washington, United States", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Breakfast\u201d", "Author": "Jack M", "ReviewID": "UR126512536", "Content": "I was attending a breakfast meeting at this hotel yesterday. the breakfast that was served was outstandaing.

We used the Grand Ballroom for the oral presentations in a theater arrangement and the space and chairs were fully used. We used two screens raised on risers, and they were placed on either side of the speaker. This helped attendees to clearly view the information being presented and compensate for the two columns in the middle of the room. We also used the columns as aisles to minimize the dead space behind the columns. We used the back of the room for two lines of poster boards and the two side rooms (Whidbey-Shaw and Lee-Vashon) for both posters and for lunches. All of this was cozy, but the BW staff was more than accommodating to work around the spaces and with the organizing committee. For lunches, BW staff had buffets and table rounds in each of the side rooms and also used the restaurant as overflow areas. We also contraced for the all-day break package which was kept stocked with a variety of fresh foods, coffee, and drinks. The food was excellent. The catering staff prepared themed lunches that were tasty and fresh and were very much complimented by attendees. We also had two h'ordeurve parties, and the choices cooked up by the chef and kitchen were delicious. I will definitely consider using the catering component if I have any other functions in the downtown area. We liked the location of the facility as it is away from the congestion and hub-bub of downtown Seattle. There is plenty of parking, at least during the winter days, and the hotel is near bus lines and reachable from the airport by taking the light rail and monorail. We also chose this facility because of its affordable costs--both in terms of rooms and catering--they outcompeted other nearby places and we did not suffer in quality at all. Overall, the best part of working with the BW was the friendliness, efficiency, and eagerness of the catering and facilities staff to work with the conference organizers. Minor problems were quickly solved, the costs were clearly identified, meals were easily worked out, and all of this made it easier for the organziers to execute the conference. Attendees remarked on the high quality of the food and the seamlessness of the facility and staff in supporting the meeting.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clacton-on-Sea, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA family favourite!\u201d", "Author": "Aloysius65", "ReviewID": "UR124219153", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions over the past few years - both on my own and with family members - when visiting relatives in Washington State.

Restaurant in evening very unwelcoming, was wondering if open or not on first night, and on second night others came along wondering the same! Good sized meals though. OK at breakfast time though, felt more welcoming and handy to have buffet breakfast downstairs. But very good staff on the desk.

The hotel is just a short walk (1 block) to the Seattle center, bus stops and the monorail that takes you into town.( the monorail is fun!)

They said they had an arrangement with a town car company to bring guests to the hotel for $30 for up to 4 people and that a cab would cost twice as much. We waited 45 min for the car to come after the driver said he would be there in 5 min. When he arrived he said he had a chance for a better fare and took it knowing it would take 40 min to get back. When we got to the hotel he charged $50 and said the clerk told us wrong. I called the clerk and asked on the speaker phone and was told $ 30 again. The driver said he was referring to another company. So I paid. Inside the clerk said he never quoted a price. It was 12 pm and the room would not be ready until 4 pm so we stored the luggage and checked in. The rate we were quoted was on the reservation which I had and was $45 less than what he was going to charge. He changed the rate to the agreed upon rate. They advertise a $4.95 full breakfast buffet but charge $6.95 for one of the worst breakfasts I have ever seen. No regular coffee only decaf and it was Luke warm. No fruit. No bacon and the eggs wer cold. There is a McDonalds one block away which had a better breakfast for $3.50 Since you have a microwave and refrig in the room we bought milk and cereal at a store Longe with a coffee cake.

The Executive Inn is a block away from McDonald's and two blocks away from the Space Needle and monorail. The Executive Inn was a good value for the location, and I was able to walk over from the monorail station after taking the LINK from the airport to Westlake Mall and then transferring onto the monorail at Westlake. The only problem I had with the motor inn was the noise. The people in the room next door to me had their tv blasting away at 10 P.M. while I was trying to sleep. They were so loud that I could hear every word they were saying. At one point, the woman asked her male companion to turn down the tv so that she didn't \"need to shout over it\". She needn't have bothered, he didn't turn it down, and she was so loud, he didn't need to. My husband managed to fall asleep despite the noise only to be woken up at 10:15 P.M, when someone knocked on our door. They went away before we could see who it was. You could also hear toilets flushing through walls, and loud talking from guests getting off the nearby elevator. There is a fire station nearby, so you can also hear when they respond to calls. There were also plumbers who were talking outside the hotel at 4:00 A.M. before driving off, and the trash dumpsters were serviced at 5:40 A.M. To the hotel's credit, I did receive a response to my complaint's about the noise mentioned in a hotel survey I completed. I was asked if I complained about the loud tv/talking next door, (I did not), and management promised to address the noise problems at future meetings. When I had encountered a loud tv previously at my stay in another hotel, I had complained, and security told me after responding to the complaint that the room was found to be empty with just the tv blasting which they then turned off- end of problem. Since there were two people in the room next door this time, and they were well aware that the tv was too loud, I didn't see the point in complaining, but at least it is nice to know that the hotel management probably would have told them to turn it down had they been asked. I recommend this hotel with reservations. If you plan to stay out sightseeing late and don't plan on going to bed until midnight anyway, or if you are a heavy sleeper, then the noise issues probably won't be a concern. For guests like me who are taking cruises from Pier 91, take the #24 bus to the pier rather than the hotel's town car (cost is $2 for the bus, $8 for hotel's town car, pp).", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "OhMai", "Title": "\u201cOur saviours! ~3.5/5???

I loved how we were allowed to keep our car in the gated parking garage until 6pm, that allowed us to take the Monorail the next day. The room was clean, and the beds were comfy. The shower pressure was perfect and water was hot enough. I honestly can't say anything bad about this hotel. From the moment you step in, everything looked well kept and managed.

I need rest and comfort, otherwise why I am spending so much money. Anyways, they also offered a rollaway bed - the most uncomfortable bed. I could not sleep whole night. I extended my stay, thinking that the previous night was one time deal. But it was a mistake. Since I could have good sleep, I took prescribed sleep aid. The next day, when I asked for late checkout @ 1 PM, they blatantly deny the request. They gave one hour, which was not sufficient for my sleep and my pregnant wife was also not well.

Only if I could have taken more rest, I would have never witnessed that incident. Then we went to rest area and took a lot rest. After coming from the trip, I did file the complaint. The first step to fix the problem is to recognize the problem - the problem that they had in your system instead of blaming me with my booking or having some sympathy to ask why we want to extend by an hour. They became defensive. I am sure they are going to put a comment to explain how every customer is important and how it was not there mistake. Apart from the misleading parking lot charge that I was not aware about ( and someone else had the same problem here) and dull ambience, the inability to recognize the problem in their service is a big disapppointment.

If not, we would just drive down to the waterfront and do through the aquarium. We were told by the hotel employee that she could not answer that over the phone, we need to go in to find out the answer. I realize that the answer to this question has several different variables: room availability, company policy, etc. However, we had traveled across the state with two kids and were just asking if it would be possible. I would have been happy to check in later. Once we arrived, we were checked in by the same individual that we had just spoken with. We were behind another couple that was checking in and I overheard the employee provide instructions to the couple ahead of us. After checking in, we were told that there was a daily parking charge of $15, which while somewhat reasonable, was not advertised at the time of the reservation. The unnamed employee (no nametag visible) then offered assistance to the next people in line to check in. At which point, I asked where the parking was. I received a blank look in return. After getting that it was below the building, I went to park my car. Now, I must comment that the parking garage leaves a LOT to be desired. The two handicapped spots that are next to the elevator are only marked for compact vehicles. I do not drive a compact vehicle. I can accept existing parking garage design restrictions prevent ideal parking spaces. I can also acknowledge that while they might meet the letter of the law for American with Disabilities Act, it does not make it convenient in any way. I was able to locate a parking spot further away from the elevator. But that presented a problem in itself. When my wife tried to bring the luggage cart to the car, she couldn\u2019t. The parking structure had a height restriction of 6 foot. The cart was taller than 6 foot. I was able to tilt the cart over and drag it through this height restricted area because it was empty. But, once loaded with our luggage, I could no longer perform this feat. I will point out that you can go around the parking garage to the other side where the height restriction allows the cart to pass through loaded. However, as previously mentioned, I am handicapped and walking any distance is rather difficult. Walking into my room was like hitting a wall of cheap cologne. I don\u2019t know if the smell was supposed to cover up a more foul stench, or if it was from the previous occupant. Either way, it was rather unpleasant, if not survivable. I proceeded to sit in the nice comfy chair only to find out that all the comfy qualities of said chair were worn out. The arms of the char were not nicely padded, instead the wood frame wound up digging into my arms. Sense I was on my long awaited vacation, I figured that I would make the best of things. I then took off my shoes and socks, I like walking around barefoot on carpet. It\u2019s a small guilty pleasure after having my foot in and out of casts for four years. I walked across the room to splash some water on my face only to find that my feet stuck to the carpet with every step. I put my socks back on. Jump ahead to my shower experience. I will acknowledge that your hotel has \u201cGone Green,\u201d and while the shower head might be eco friendly, it is not person friendly. A high pressure, low volume nozzle is more fitting in a C&C environment, not in a shower. I found that the extra time spent trying to rinse off countered any water saving qualities that the shower head offers. The Elevators are smooth if not very slow. I am sure that this is a constant complaint, but let me address this. While waiting for the elevators, after several minutes, I began to look around for the stairs. I saw on the wall next to the elevators a sign indicating in case of a fire, use the stairs. Great sign, really useful to those that are unaccustomed to elevators, however, I saw no signs as to where these stairs were. Now, up until now I have talked about comfort features. This is a real safety issue. On day two, I was talking to another hotel patron about the long wait for the elevator. He mentioned to me that there are stairs at both ends of the hall, but they do not go down to the lobby. The stairs apparently only lead to the outside. For being an eco friendly hotel, not providing the option for stairs instead of the elevator seems a little short sighted. I know that this addresses a structure issue and not one easily overcome without major building modifications. I can say that the room had a very nice view of the Space Needle and was conveniently located next to the EMP, Space Needle, and the Pacific Science Center. But the hotel description fails to mention the fire station that must reside next to it. Between the sirens going off all night and the people running screaming down the hall, I found it really rather difficult to get any sleep. I will take the blame for not reporting the screamer to the front desk. By that time, I had pretty well given up on sleep and found it a distraction from the sirens. The four days and three nights that we spent in this hotel sounds more like a comedy of errors that the tragic experience that it was. When I spend my vacation time and my money on a hotel room, I expect far more that what I received. That being said, the experience was not a complete waste. After having spent my vacation in this hotel, I have absolutely no desire to stay in any other Best Western hotel again.

The Best Western Executive Inn is located directly next to the Space Needle and the city's monorail system.

The proximity of the Space Needle keeps the surrounding area safe at all times of the day, and the hotel itself is well-lit and nicely maintained. The interior of the hotel has a small but comfortable lobby, as well as a full-service restaurant and bar, while the rooms themselves are spacious and very clean. The restaurant offers an incredible daily breakfast to large groups that includes: eggs, roasted potatos, sausage, waffles, bagels, pastries, a variety of cereals, juices, fresh fruit, coffee and tea that is far better than I have had at many more \"high-end\" locations. Beyond this, because of the variety of options, this breakfast is uniquely suited to the finicky appetities of younger travelers, and thereby ensures that all in your group will be equally satisfied. Most importantly, the staff at the Executive Inn is just superb. Knowing how large groups can often require additional attention to make sure that all needs are met, the staff at Best Western is always ready to do what is necessary to ensure that your group gets what they need to be comfortable and satisfied. This willingness to positively work with groups to keep things going smoothly makes things beeter for your group, and consequently all of the other guests in the hotel as well. In short, the central location of this hotel, the easy access it provides to the downtown area, the cleanliness of the accomodations, the great breakfast afforded to their guests, and the hospitality of the staff make this the perfect place to stay if you are bringing a group to Seattle.

Staff on the whole were friendly enough, though not the standard expected when staying or visiting somewhere in the USA. There was one particular woman on receiption we nicknamed PPMT (Permanent PMT), none of the staff wore name badges so I can't name her, but she was in her 20's with short blond(ish) bobbed hair, she was rude, short conversationalist and just downright customer unfriendly. The girlfriend of one of my friends who stayed with us, rung from home and also complained to us about her and her attitiude. She described her attitude perfectly to us and it couldn't have been anyone else. There were times we thought that it was a bad day, but no the 3 times we saw her there, she was the same!! Anyway, the hotel is an okay. The rooms are pretty standard though the walls pretty thin, in fact we were able to do tap on our friends wall in the room next to us if we wanted them instead of ringing, and were able hear one of our friends snoring too!! The windows are too thin also, our cheaper rated hotel room didn't have a view of the space needle, so I only assume that the windows are thicker for the richer guests. I say this because every morning, whether you like it or nor you get woken up in the morning by he sound of TWO HELICOPTERS. They come from the local TV news buildings, Komo 4 news, and another news broadcaster that I can't remember the name of. Added with this is almost constant noise from police, fire and ambulance sirens. In the end I bought ear-plugs and slept very well - this is a tip to be highly receommended!! A small gripe from an \"international\" visitors point of view, is that the TV had no international TV stations, there is around 80 to choose from and not one is world news, for example BBC World or CNN International. This is as i say a small gripe, as you can use the internet for free in the \"business center\" which is just a very small room with two computers in it, if you want to catch up on things back home etc. The breakfast buffet is also ok, though after staying there for 6 days (we used the hotel as a base for different excursions), it was became samey. Your selection is potato wedges, chippolatas, scrambled egg (which was also square shaped as though it literally had just come out of can), waffles, 2-3 choices of cereal and oatmeal, bananas, 3 juices and tea and coffee. Good points are that's it is VERY close to the Space Needle (which itself is over rated as we later found out that you can go up the Columbia Center building in downtown which is 75 floors up instead of 42! and gives better panoramic views). The space needle has a monorail whoch connects you to downtown within 2-3 minutes and a return trip for $4 it's not a bad way of travelling into to the city. The hotel has friendly bar staff and, rarely for a hotel (I think), a pool table which was frequented by us a couple of times. Best of all for us, was that it was near to a great bar called SPORT, and as the name suggests it's a sports bar with the friendliest bar staff you can meet, what a find that was. Good food too, and just a two minute walk from the hotel. The car park, despite the critism I've read is very secure, ok you have to pay for the parking space, but I'd much rather have to do that than leave it outdoors. We saw two men forcing money out of the parking meters in the car park opposite one morning, and no doubt they had a look around the cars in the car park to see anything valuable was on display before raiding the machines!!

It is a public street, and falls under the same Seattle bylaws. Locals seem to know this and park there anyway to go to a nearby late-night club. Anyway, save your money and park on the street (plenty of free space in this area), or stay at the Travel Lodge next door which offers free parking.

The hotel is a bit dated on the exterior and the neighborhood is undergoing a bit of much needed regentrification. I never felt unsafe but I can see why those unfamilar with the urban setting may be. While there were some street people about they arent aggressive and there are enough regular folk walking around that I wouldnt hesitate to put my 72 year old mother in the neighborhood. The location is excellent! Read that again, Excellent. there are hundreds of restaurants all within about a 10-15 minute walk. I absolutely LOVE walking around in a vibrant downtoan urban setting and this area makes me want to trade in my suburban ranch for a loft. I tried the Spitfire on 4th and Bell and the Frontier room on 1st and Blanchard. Spitfire is southwest spicy sandwiches and salads and Frontier is excellent BBQ, not KC but very good smoked meats, ribs and sandwiches. The Space needle is around the corner, get an even numbered room for a view, otheriwise the view is just cityscape. The room was clean and while a bit bland served it purpose well. The bed was comfy and there was a fridge and micro. The bathroom is on the smallish side but the water pressure was great. The room is completely 'green' with low impact features which I would expect in Seattle. The staff was very friendly, that famous northwest hospitality very evident. I would skip the restaurant in the lobby as it seems to be very basic hotel fare and since there are literally hundreds of great options so very close. The hotel charges $15 a night for parking and while that is a huge pet peeve of mine I was aware of it going in and it only annoyed me to the point of mentioning it here. Really, tack on $20 to the price of the room and get rid of the charge, its silly. With hotel prices rising rapidly in the past couple of years, this place gives a great experience at a reasonable rate. The place I stayed last year went from $140/night to $275, so at $130, this place is a steal and if you are expecting the W this aint it.

They were nice enough to store it in their restaurant freezer for us free of charge! Some cons: - You have to pay for parking - The hallways kind of scared me upon getting off the elevator because it seemed pretty dingy (they need to do some steam cleaning or something - I would not want to walk around on bare feet!) - The construction zone next to the hotel might worry people but seriously, we didn't hear any of that noise through the walls or anything in the morning. - The people at the front desk can be a little nicer but that really wasn't a big deal to us.
