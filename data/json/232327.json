It's in a great location and within walking distance of everything you'll want to see in Amsterdam. If walking's not your thing, the transport links are great and the tram stops outside of the hotel. We stayed in a triple room with our teenage daughter and found it to be clean and pleasantly decorated, with a huge wall mounted TV and a decent shower. The room was very small, as has been commented on by other visitors, but as we spent very little time in the room, it didn't really matter. The beds were very comfortable (the double was actually two singles pushed together) and the room (Rm 47) was at the rear of the building, so was very quiet. The only complaint we had was that the temperature in room and the thick quilts made it far too warm to get a decent night's sleep. The buffet breakfast was included in the price and was standard continental fayre. On the down side, there was one over whelmed waitress and one over worked toaster to serve around 40 - 50 guests. This caused queues for guests waiting for a clear table and for those wanting a slice toast. The reception staff were very helpful, offering to book us tickets at Boom Chicago (comedy club - highly recommended) and printing our boarding passes for the flight home.

The other room on this floor overlooking the road was very small so we chose a much larger one at the back, which still had a nice view and was probably even quieter. Could have done with higher bulb wattage though, very difficult to read in the room and the sink really does need updating in line with the rest of the room and hotel.

There was a good choice at breakfast with the usual choice of cereals, hard boiled eggs, cheeses and meats with plenty of choice of breads (which could be toasted), rolls, croissants (although these ran out quickly) and fruit bread. This hotel is so convenient for everything, there are 5 trams that stop right outside, a lovely little pub on the corner 4 houses down. We had a very enjoyable stay here and loved Amsterdam. Hope to come back one day and would stay here again.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cDon't Go!!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4688631", "Content": "I was so excited when I got to Amsteradm and ready to experience all the this city had to offer. But I was not at all ready for the nasty, tiny bathroom that we had. The hotel is located near a lot of attractions ie, The Red Light District, The Train Station, Restaurants ect, but it is just not what I am accustomed to! The shower was not only small but nasty the sink had scrapes in it and very dirty looking. When I asked for more towels I was told by the front desk attendant \"I will see what i can do. \" I am still waiting on those towels. It smells like an ash tray in the hall way. I know what AMsterdam is all about but when I go to a hotel I expect a little more than what I received. If ever I am in AMsterdam again I will not stay at this hotel! Don't go, I am sure there is something a little nicer.", "Date": "March 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crewe, England", "Title": "\u201cHotel Citadel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4450386", "Content": "My cousins and I booked a 2 night break and were very impressed with the quality of the hotel.
