I'm a very unhappy conference attendee. I reserved my King room online with my conference promo and paid by credit card a month ago. When I arrived, they said that they were sold out of rooms and they only had their \"suites\" available that would have a pull-out sofa bed. Which sounded fine. But the nice Russian-accented lady did not fully explain is that there in this suite, there is no bed! This is a meeting room with a pull-out couch. She said the rest of the hotel was all sold out. Two other guests checking in with me also were assigned these meeting rooms with no beds. So I've now been waiting over 30 minutes for housekeeping to bring sheets so that I can make up my pull-out bed. There is no bed, no sheets or pillows. Space set-up is crazy. 3 escalators and then walk through the bars and restaurants and then up the elevator to one's room. There are no direct elevators.

We were there for a conference, which was canceled. We elected to wait out the storm at the hotel - and we felt safe. I'm not going to comment on that part, because it was mother nature. The hotel did a very good job at taking care of their stranded guests. They were running on a skeleton crew and doing the best they could under the circumstances.

Because this was right after Hurricane Isaac, the hotel was very full with many locals who had no power and with many electrical contractors there for work. Despite these bookings, the hotel seemed a bit understaffed as room service deliveries etc. were very slow. On check-in, the staff acknowledged my Diamond status, but our Diamond amenity never came and we were not allowed to have as late a check-out as we would have liked. Overall the service was mediocre at best. With respect to the property, it's huge, clean and impressive. However, the surrounding area and views are depressing. We were advised that it was safe to walk to the French Quarter during the day, but not at night. Also, the Internet was unreliable and wouldn't work at times and the hotel computers for checking into flights weren't working. We used a suite upgrade and we felt like it was a complete waste. Our suite (room 2424) was poorly designed. It was essentially one large room with a dividing wall between the living room and the bedroom. The problem was that the air conditioning and vents were all in the living room portion of the suite with no vents in the bedroom portion. So we had to run the air conditioning at 60 degrees in the living room just to have a minimal cooling effect in the bedroom so we could sleep at night. Because we had to keep the living room so cold, we really didn't get to use it. We would have been better off with a standard room and saved the suite upgrade for a different property.

Valet was an easy process on drop off.(Expect to pay $40 per night for it, but it is New Orleans, parking is difficult to find). I pre-checked in online, so getting the room keys were easy. My rooms were ready upon arrival. They do require a deposit of $50 for incidentals, but most upscale hotels do. Luggage was promptly delivered. I loved not having to tote luggage through this large hotel. I had a king club and a double queen. The king had a spectacular view of the superdome. Breathtaking was more like it! The other had a city view, not spectacular, but still nice. Reviews made it seem as if navigating was impossible. With that in mind, we actually found it easy to get around. Saturday was game day, and there was a convention, so it got really busy. But this is the price you pay for proximity to the \"dome\". It just requires more patience and planning. Room service was on-time, and good. Staff was friendly. Valet was a little slow at check out, but remember there was a game and convention. Pre-plan ahead to check-in and out at non-peak times. Simple pre-planning can make your stay more enjoyable.This will definantly be my hotel of choice in the future for games. Big-YES, Crowded on game day-YES, Easy access to the dome-YES. Woth it-ABSOLUTELY! (This hotel also offers a GULF discount for residents of Gulf States-it made my rooms VERY affordable! That is a huge plus. Paid 1/3 of what I paid for a room in the quarter.

Despite horrific traffic due to concert-goers & detours from adding the trolley line in front of the hotel, along with an extremely busy lobby, check- in was relatively easy, but I was thinking about all of those reviews and felt like I was living them. My husband dropped me while he parked at the $27 self- park adjacent to the hotel which was easier than valet considering the wait for it. Besides, it's cheaper, so you may as well park there. I do suggest you divide & conquer like that because you will end up on level 2 of the hotel from the garage & will just need yo go up one level to the rooms. Once my family & I met back up on level 2, we just needed to hit an escalator to level 3 to the room elevators. Let me explain that this hotel is deceivingly huge. There is a lot of walking just to get to your room, but you're amidst beautiful furnishings & it's fun to people watch as you pass the restaurant & bar. The kids loved the glass elevator & the cool view you get if the Superdome as it takes you to your floor. Speaking of which, these elevators are not confusing. You push the number of the floor you're on, and it tells you which door you're going to use instead of you trying to figure out which door is going to open. You only need your key after 10 pm which is a good thing. After a night at the casino, we discovered we didn't have ours. There is an attendant at the elevators at this hour who is happy to help all of the drunk people staggering in. We were no exception. She took us to our room on the 23rd floor and made sure we belonged there. It sure beat traipsing back across the hotel to the lobby to get another key, especially after walking around the French Quarter all day. The service was great unlike what some reviewers said. It was particularly great when we finally got into our room after battling the traffic, the crowded lobby & parking garage, the trek to the elevators & our key didn't work. I was about to cry because we already arrived late & the concert was starting shortly when the door to the room opened. It was already occupied! Now, for many of you, I realize this would merit a horrible review. However, the hotel manager himself came up to put us in a different room. When we entered that room, I realized it didn't match the description on the website which indicates a queen/queen with a sofa. After bringing this up and pointing it out to the manager, he had a rollaway bed sent to our room without charge. He also had our keys coded to enter the 32nd floor to the Regency Club where there are daily snacks, hors d' ourves, desserts, coffee, soda, an honor bar, and a great view of the city. This helped to supersede any negativity. Once the trolley line is in, this will be a premier hotel not only for conferences and concerts, but for hitting the Riverwalk, casino, & the French Quarter. Until then, expect to walk. A lot. Otherwise, this is a modern, clean (although our room was vacuumed during our stay), hotel with lovely service.

I stayed in this hotel for 15 nights and accumulated charges of $3,550.76. During this period, my client also had many other business travelers staying at this hotel. I estimate that the total charges were more than $50,000, perhaps $100,000.00. I travel and stay in hotels about 100 to 150 nights per year around the world. I have never had a worse experience at any hotel anywhere in the world compared to the 15 nights that I spent in the Hyatt Regency New Orleans. The hotel has so many management flaws and inconsiderate staff that is hard to remember all of the issues that I had with my stay. Repeated calls to the front desk and the management about these problems were simply not corrected. I was always reassured that things would be fixed or improved, but they got worse instead of better. It was an experience that I will never forget. As best as I can remember, here are the management and quality problems that I faced during my stay. 1. Maid Service. My room was rarely clean during my stay. I called the housekeeping manager on three successive days in order to get the floor vacuumed for the first time after I had been in the room for 10 days. It took three calls on three days! The floor was never vacuumed after that. The sheets were not changed for 10 days until I called repeatedly to request a change in linens. The cosmetics were not replaced after I used them, even when I requested a replacement. The rubber bath mat in the tub (a very slippery surface) disappeared after about 5 days, and despite my repeated written notes and requests to housekeeping, it was never replaced during my stay. I'm glad that I slipped only once. I repeatedly asked for additional laundry bags and slips and had to speak with the manager on duty in order to finally get a second set delivered to my room. The replacement of towels was so random that my colleagues and I joked about it just about every day. Sometimes none were replaced, and sometimes one or two. There was rarely a replacement of the cloth bath mat. On some days, there was no service when I returned to my room after work at 6:30 pm. 2. Elevator service. The elevator system in this hotel is not adequate for the number of guest rooms and guests in the building. On 6 days during my stay, I entered my floor number (18) on the third floor after work and received the response: \"Try again later.\" This essentially meant \"go away, you cannot use the elevator today to get to your room on the 18th floor.\" I had to wait 15-20 minutes on each of those days before the system would accept my request for floor 18. While this was highly annoying, it was especially annoying to me since there is no way to get from floor 18 to the gym on floor 32 without first going down from 18 to 3 and then back up from 3 to 32. I did this every day for 15 days and on 6 of those days the system told me to go away. 3. Repairs. During my stay, the bathroom ceiling fell in above the tub and the toilet in the bathroom ran continuously. I reported both of these and both were repaired. 4. Wake up calls. On several occasions, I received no wake up call at the time I requested it. Fortunately, I set a backup alarm on my cell phone or I would have been late for my client meetings. 5. Noise. The Hyatt Regency New Orleans is not a business-friendly hotel. It is a convention hotel and the level of noise in the hallways sometimes is overwhelming. My calls to security never helped quiet the noisy people in the hallway as I was trying to sleep at 11:00 pm or later. One day the music in the 32nd floor gym was turned up so loud that I could not even hear my own music in my earphones. I called the front desk 3 times before it was finally turned down to a reasonable level. It is impossible for guests to control the level of music in the gym. 6. Laundry. I used the laundry service three times -- or at least tried to use it three times. Twice my shirts came back with stains and the third time, my laundry was lost. It was my last day at the hotel and they finally found it (undone) at the front desk on the day I left. I had left the laundry at about 8:00 am, well before the 9:00 am cutoff. A surly person delivered my dirty laundry bag to my room after repeated calls. No apologies, no nothing. 7. Internet service. The wireless internet service was spotty and would often simply cut off in the middle of a work project in my room. And when I check out, I found that you had charged m $5.00 plus tax on several days for \"movies\" that I had never watched! 8. Good service in the block 8 restaurant. The service in the block 8 restaurant for breakfast was consistently good. Servers were exceptionally competent and helpful. The cost of the buffet breakfast, of course, was absolutely outrageous, but due to the location of the hotel there are very few alternatives for breakfast. They certainly take advantage of your monopoly of place and charge twice what I am used to paying at other similar hotels on my business travel. Bottom line: save your money and stay somewhere else.

The hotel has been nicely redone and I didn't think the walk to the elevators was too bad but the bellmen could have been quicker to offer assistance especially to our older members. Which I guess is the basis for my disappointment the regency staff offered none of the hospitality we have found in previous stays in this city that thrives on the tourist trade. We were caught in a tourist trap. Stay away from the convenience store once premise its super over priced and the food is nuked. A real starbucks is a great addition and having fedex office right there is awesome. The smart elevators are nice when its not too crowded but this is a convention hotel and they were constantly getting stuck and running slow. Beds were wonderfully comfy, but watch what they put on your card without telling you before they charge you. Incidentals are $50 per night and even if you want to pay cash and just have incidentals placed on your charge don't be surprised to find they've floated the entire bill on your card anyway. This happened to several members and to my husband and I. Don't even bother trying to use the Hyatt gift cards, personnel haven't been trained in the use and even though the web says you can use them within the hotel we were only able to use at the front desk and then it took 3 ppl to figure out how to credit us for $50.

This really is a beautiful hotel. The food was good. There were many different places to get a drink or sit down for a minute. Everything was clean and pretty. Every Hyatt employee I encountered was very friendly and very helpful. My room was really nice and very clean. The walkways to the rooms on every floor are open to the big atrium which is really cool and when there is music playing, it travels up and is really nice. There's also a great view of the Superdome from the elevators. I would have to say my only complaint about my experience is about the elevator system. They have a modern, high-tech elevator system in which you wave your room key card at a station, it registers what floor you are on and then tells you which elevator to stand in front of. When you get on the elevator, there are no buttons to push as the elevator \"knows\" which floor you want to go to. This worked fine and was no big deal (kind of fun even) for most of the time. However, it was a gigantic nightmare during the conference when a thousand people would get out of the conference and need to get up to their rooms to get ready for the evening event and get back down. It seemed there was some sort of malfunction or overload and the elevators were not coming and the line to \"check in\" to the elevator was getting longer and longer. One night I had to walk up to my room (10th floor) because I was in danger of not getting back down in time for transportation to the night event. But this was really my only complaint. I very much enjoyed my stay at this Hyatt.

I originally gave the property 2 stars based on my experiences, but they took it upon themselves to reach out to me after I completed the standard post stay email survey I received. They went out of their way to address the issues and take care of me, so I felt it only right to remove the original 2 star review and replace it with a more accurate sentiment based on my feelings overall after their post stay actions. Below is the original review, as I still do not think that the original review should disappear, as my reasons for my dissatisfaction still happened, but I also don't think it is fair to ding a hotel online and not adjust it for any followups they take later to fix the problems or address customer dissatisfaction. I wish Tripadvisor let you update reviews. I booked 2 rooms here for 3 days on a Hyatt promo rate, which included free breakfast every day for 2 people and the 3rd night free. I booked both rooms in my name and got one for myself and wife, and one for parents. Upon arrival, the hotel was super busy, and check in was fairly slow. There were numerous people standing in line, and there was a Diamond/Platinum check in line, but it was not being staffed by any of the 3 people at the counter. When we checked in, the gentleman who checked us in was very pleasant and accommodating, although he did take quite a while to process the check in. I won't really fault him, as he was, as mentioned, very nice and did his best to handle it properly. The hotel itself is pretty nice...it looks newly renovated and has a lovely spacious lobby with a variety of art. One thing that is strange...to get to the rooms, you have to go up 2 flights of stairs (escalator or elevator is available) and then walk past a few restaurants to get to the room elevators. The elevator system is kind of confusing at first, and a little inconvenient. The room was nice enough, as it was a basic room. It had a flat screen TV and a comfortable enough bed, although the pillows left much to be desired (more on that...). The bathroom was large and spacious and the shower had satisfactory enough pressure and the water was very soft. Overall, just considering those factors, I would say the stay would have been a 4 star stay, since it was a pretty nice hotel, with a comfortable enough room and was well located enough...but then the problems began. First off, there was a bottle of Aquafina in the closet, on a tray with 2 glasses next to it. There was NO label, NO price tag, NOTHING to indicate the water was not complimentary (as MANY quality hotels provide 1 bottle of water free). We consumed this bottle to find out later it was not free. Second, after a miserable night trying to sleep with the pillows which were too firm for us, we asked if there were other pillows. The front desk said they had some foam pillows and they would send some up. That never happened. I had to call again later that night, several hours later, because they never brought them the first time. Third, we went down to the restaurant for the buffet breakfast which was included in the promo rate and had to wait about 15 minutes. Now, this alone would not be an issue, but when we got in the restaurant, there was literally about 40% vacant tables. We asked why it took so long and why people were kept waiting and they said they lacked the staff to handle it, although our server, polite and friendly as he was, looked like he was bored and trying to find stuff to do. On a busy holiday weekend on a Sunday, they should have staffed better if that was the problem. However, I will say the breakfast was very good and for the $21 sticker price, it would be a very good value as hotel breakfasts go. Fourth, we had a very early flight on the departure day, so we went to the front desk to check out and make sure everything was handled the night prior. When I got the bill for the first room, I found a $4 charge for the bottle of water we used...although it was charged to the OTHER room I had. That room did not even HAVE a bottle placed in it at any time, although my parents later showed me a $4 tag that said \"hydrate\" which they found in THEIR room, but without any bottle of water. That tag was missing from my room. Next, they charged me for breakfast on one of the 2 days, which I had to have taken off. Now, they took it off, but that irritates me...I hate hotels where I have to analyze every corner of the bill for stuff like that. Next, I noticed a tax charge on the breakfast, and was told by the front desk that the breakfast was free, but the gratuity PLUS THE TAX was not. They charged me the added gratuity I put on it (thats fine..although many hotels cover that as well) AS WELL AS the sales tax??? Seriously? I have never heard of anything so ludicrous...the breakfast is free, but hey you owe us $3.22 for tax? Pathetic. Fifth, I asked twice at check out if I needed to request a taxi for the next day or if there would be one waiting. I was assured there are ALWAYS taxis ready, which was important because when you are already getting up at 2am to get to the airport on time, every bit counts. Of course, when we went to get the taxi the next morning, they had to call one, which took another 15 minutes, and we ended up with a DIFFERENT cab, which happened to show up by chance, not even the one they called. Unreal again. Overall, the service was friendly, the room was decent (nothing great, but not bad), and the breakfast was very good. However, no attempt was even made or offered to remove the $4 for the water which was NOT labelled and even charged to the WRONG room, one mistake or bout of incompetence after another just really marred the stay. We paid $340 plus taxes ($390 total) for 3 nights with 2 breakfasts, but based solely on this experience, I would not stay here again. However, they did reach out to me after I completed my survey via email about my stay and addressed my complaints and refunded me the water charges. Overall, I would say that based on the customer service post stay and the overall quality of the hotel itself when subtracting out the complaints, I would stay here again.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Bedford, MA", "Title": "\u201cShiney & New but lacking\u201d", "Author": "miechy", "ReviewID": "UR133042633", "Content": "It isn't any one thing that earned this a 3 star but a hotel like the Hyatt has high expectations.

I've never been one to go on about staying at a Hyatt, but noticed they had Respire, \"Allergy Friendly\" rooms and had to check it out. As far as the actual room goes, it was comfortable and well appointed, though small. But the allergy free factors helped make it wonderful, and I'll be sure to plan on such stays in the future. I cannot begin to say how many times I've had to check out of hotels shortly after checking in, due to allergic reactions to something or other. Whether it's chemicals in the carpet, gallons of air freshener or carpet refreshing dust, etc., etc., which all starts in with watering, itchy eyes, headaches, tightness of chest and wheezing, some of us just have to plan ahead and make sure we're getting an allergy/asthma friendly room. This Respire trend is helping a lot! Even the soaps and shampoos were hypoallergenic, so there were none of the irritations which can go with that. And the Healthway air purifier worked wonders with particulate removal. I'm not sure whether or not it emits/removes ozone and gasses or not. However, this is a major step in the right direction for anyone suffering with respiratory allergies, reactive airway disease/asthma, I will definitely recommend this to everyone I know who suffers with any of the above. Other factors in the hotel are a super friendly and helpful staff, who went out of their way to make everything comfortable and easy. Though, the refrigerator in the room did not work, and when I went to turn off the TV later at night, it would not shut off and a technician had to come up to fix it. While that went fairly quickly, it did involve getting dressed again when I would rather have been in bed sleeping. They seemed to act as if this were a common occurrence, so, if you're TV is having an issue at all, such as not being able to connect to room service to complete your order (no comment,) don't do what I did and ignore it, thinking everything is fine. Call early and tell the desk you believe there's an issue with the PC card on your TV. While the food is typically pricey, it's no higher than comparable establishments. There is also a Rouse's Supermarket only two blocks away which is quite safe to walk to, and which has a great selection of foods, deli items, wines, beers, liquors, all at much more normalized prices.

The elevator banks are dialpad--you tell it where you want to go and a computer voice assigns you an elevator. A little sci fi , but I liked it.

I give the staff high marks for hospitality and helpfulness. There is a Starbucks for a quick coffee (soul music soundtrack). The business center was set up for boarding passes. My room was comfortable, well-furnished. Loved the bed. They added a little extra security at the ends of the double horseshoe hallways with a keyed vestibule. End rooms have a corner view too. All in all, the only drawback is the long walk to the French Quarter. I mentioned to the desk clerk that a hotel of that magnitude might run a shuttle and they told me they plan to have a shuttle in the near future. The only other improvement they could make is to add some life and color to the atrium. Do a light show. Hang a super mobile. Show movies on the ceiling. Right now it's a bit severe.

Good stuff - extraordinarily helpful staff, delicious fresh fruit at the breakfast buffet, good conference facilities. We were there three nights on business. My overriding impression is a hotel with staff taking a lot of trouble to make guests comfortable, but hotel systems and services that don't work very well. We arrived very late at night and were allocated a room on the 17th floor. Judging by comments from other guests and other TripAdvisor reviewers, we must've had a smaller than average room. The slight lack of room space didn't trouble us, but the bathroom really was cramped and there wasn't enough desk space for a laptop and a notepad. The worst sin (in my opinion) is a 'business' hotel that charges $45 dollars plus taxes for three days of wifi access! And then it's only for three devices. So once the laptop, blackberry and iPad are connected, you then have to force off one of those devices with an IP logout to log in with the second smart phone. Or pay even more! The air conditioning system was extremely noisy. Louder than a window unit each time it roared into life. Loud enough to cause me to use earplugs to sleep. Loud enough to cause us to switch the AC off when making telephone calls. It was LOUD. And that wasn't just our room. Others complained too. The location is fine for an in-hotel conference and for short forays into the tourist districts. (Or if attending an event at the Superdome which is immediately next door.) It's a ten-minute walk to the edge of the French Quarter, restaurants and the St Charles streetcar. The area felt safe enough to me, especially in daylight, if not a particularly pleasant neighbourhood to wander. But beware, a group of three men was mugged during the conference in the hotel area at night. Of course, this could have been a horribly unlucky incident that could happen in any city, but there is much more of an overt police presence in the French Quarter. The layout of the three lower public floors is very confusing. Obliging staff willingly interrupted what they were doing to escort us to Starbucks, conference rooms, the BBQ place but you have to allow time for getting lost. Once you find where you're going, the myriad conference facilities are excellent. The final snippet I'd offer is for anyone who loves fresh fruit for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is quite pricey as you'd expect for the vast array of food on offer. But the buffet includes the most exquisite selection (which changes daily) of fresh fruit. They also have fruit on the a la carte menu but it's adulterated(!) fruit with sugar and cinnamon and muffins etc. After explaining that I sincerely only wanted a plate of just fresh fruit from the buffet, the restaurant staff came up with a reasonable price for me.

There is a lot of construction taking place in the area, but once inside, you do not hear anything. The hotel is very big, and for the first half a day, its confusing, having to take escalators to the 3rd floor, then the lift to your rooms. The lifts have no floor buttons on the inside. You have to use a keypad outside the lift, or simply wave your keycard under the keypad and it will tell you which lift (out of 8) to go to. My room was on the 14th floor, and whilst you could hear atrium noise whilst walking to your room, once the door is closed, everything is fine. The bathroom had plenty of space and a walk in shower - body wash, shampoo etc are all provided. The bedroom itself had a large TV which you can control via the remote or a keyboard. You also get a in-room safe and a fridge. My room had a little sofa, workspace, side table and one of the most comfortable beds I have every slept in. As far as the room goes, the \"highlight\" for me was actually the way the room was serviced every day - the staff have a sense of pride and went out of their way to tidy things up (even though they were tidy to my standard - they just made it neater) - going the extra mile to delight the client. 2 choccies on the pillow each night was nice too. The room also has an iron and ironing board, 3 drawers and 1 wardrobe with enough space for a weeks worth of clothes. The only thing it did not habe was an in-room coffee maker. Had to go to the starbucks on the 2nd floor for a coffee fix. Onto the other parts of the Hotel - the conference facilities were very very good. lots of flexibility and we never felt cramped. There is a sports bar, which was showing the Euro 2012 matches, so was busy - food was so-so though but the Abita beer made up for it.

Well, seeing believes. Our check-in went quickly and without incident. Although the guests do have to go up a couple of escalators and past the restaurants to the elevator, we did not find that a problem. Our room was actually quite attractive. Accordingly, on first blush my husband and I thought that in fact, the very negative reviews of the hotel were undeserved. Well, when we turned on the air conditioning, it is fairly loud. TO be fair, it does not sound like a \"jet engine\", but does sound like one of those cheaper box fans you buy from almost any store that carries fans. The air also blows so hard it seems like a kind of wind machine is on in the room. However, the biggest problem is that it STILL doesn't cool the room. The thermostat read 71 degrees, but my husband and I were so uncomfortable and we figured out that it was because the air conditioning system was not taking the HUMIDITY out of the room. The lobby is very cool and dry, so I can't figure out why they can't cool the rooms. We were in room 2033 if you are taking room notes. Worst of all, our room was never cleaned. We stayed Friday night to Monday morning. When we arrived, the room looked clean. We left the room at 9:30AM Saturday morning and did not return until just before 5:00PM. Our room had not been cleaned. We were told the staff could come back at around 7:30PM. We re-arranged our dinner plans to be our early enough to have the room cleaned. Someone showed up at 7:00 when we were in the middle of dressing for dinner. Because we were not \"ready\" to have the room cleaned, we were told we could not get service that day. Sunday we left the hotel at 10:30 for brunch. We came back at about 3:30. The bed was made, but the floor had not been vacuumed. Upon closer inspection, we found that the bathroom had not been cleaned either. How did we figure this out? We had been running late for brunch, so my husband did a quick shave over the sink and didn't think to rinse it out. The beard stubble that he'd tapped out of the shaver was still in the sink. Towels were still in the bath tub where we'd left them to ensure we got a clean set. There is almost no excuse for not servicing room at all; there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for pretending to service a room by making the bed, but not doing the basic of rinsing out the sink and tub. This review is also posted under Frequent diner1 *************************************************************************** I called down and the front desk gave me a one night credit, but there is no way to come back from this one. Finally as many have noted, there is no vending because they have a little sundries store on the second floor. This is the most expensive sundries store I have ever seen in a hotel and that is saying a lot! A granola bar that was less than an ounce (trial size) was $1.49; a regular size granola bar was $3.00. Because of the location, there is nothing else for small purchases around (closest pharmacy/walgreens/cvs is about eight really hot blocks away).

I planned the trip and booked our hotel using priceline (which I will never use again). I was given the room at a discount, which was still better than some of the other prices around, but the hotel was far away from everything we wanted to see and do. For this hotel being so upscale, I would have thought they would have more perks for their customers. My first disappointment was finding out that they offered no hotel shuttle to and from the airport. For the cost of the rooms and everything else located in this hotel, you would think that would be the least they could do. My next disappointment was in the room itself. Upon arrival, we had to wait about a half an hour to get checked into our room. The trip up to the elevators was not terrible, but it was confusaing to figure out the elevators at first. Also, no one told us that if you go up to the work out room after 10:30p.m. (I think that was the time) you can't go back down to a lower floor unless you have your room key for the elevator. The air conditioner was loud as stated by many other reviews but it helped drown out the loud children in the room next to us. Looking out our window, we had the view of the lovely city block which was very disappointing. If you want a nice view, the Dome is at least pretty to look at with the colors changing, make sure you request a room on that side. Another main point of disappointment is that I did not feel that the staff did enough to inform of us how things worked and events going on in the hotel. I think that upon checking in we should have been told that there is a buffet breakfast available every day in the one hotel restaurant. They also had live entertainment that we were never informed of either. We wanted to rent a car and told the staff that was what we wanted to do. No one ever told us we should rent it the night before because there may not be one available on the same day we wanted it. Once we rented the car it took us over a half an hour to have someone get the vehicle for us which was parked right in front of the hotel until a valet took it to the parking garage after he was given the key and told to bring it up to the door. It was a real trial of patience on our part. The rooms were beautiful and well decorated and the beds were very comfortable. However, for people who are staying for a period of time, there is no place for you to put your clothes, no drawers. There is a wardrobe that has a few hangers and three shelves (one of which has the ice bucket and glasses stored). The bathroom was also a disappointment in that it had no shelf storage either. Your hand towel had to lay on the sink top over the edge to dry. There was a music fest going on when we were there and, according to the news, this was the next largest group of visitors since Mardis Gras. Since we were so far away from everything, we tried a cab on our first night (why the hotel doesn't offer a shuttle is beyond me). It took us twenty minutes to go about twelve blocks and twenty dollars for the ride as the cab driver twisted and turned every which way but the way we really had to go to get to our destination (quite the scam). The next day we decided to get a three day transportation pass that can be used on any trolleys, busses or shuttles. It did come in handy, but if you were not at one of the first stops, you ended up standing because of the number of people getting on and off. Also, because of the number of people, it took longer riding the trolley than it did to walk while in the main part of town. We know because we did this one evening when we were waiting for the trolley and it was taking forever to get to us, so we started walking. The last night we were there was the only night I felt unsafe as we walked from the main street to our hotel because we walked past the library where there were about two dozen homeless people settling in to sleep. There were a few small groups gathered in different areas and when there are mobs like that and you are in a strange place you have never been, a little voice inside you starts to get a little paranoid. All turned out okay, but it was a somewhat scary situation to be in with no police or other people like us walking around. If you want to stay in a hotel that is pretty and costly with no perks and far away from everything, then this is the place for you. Otherwise, there are many other nice places to stay in town.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saucier, MS", "Title": "\u201cWowed!\u201d", "Author": "Janice S", "ReviewID": "UR131256842", "Content": "We had heard that this hotel was high-tech, and we weren't disappointed.

The hotel is approximately 15 to 20 minute walk to the French Quarter. If you walk, there are bars along the route which offer a place to cool off from the heat with plenty of choices of refreshments. Try a Hurricane!! If you choose, take your beverage along for the walk, alcohol is permitted. A taxi from the Hyatt Regency to the FQ is only $6.50 + tip. The hotel itself offered a great first impression. It began with the friendly door man opening the taxi door, to the eye catching main lobby area with lots of seating, a circular grand staircase, chandeliers, piano, and escalators. The service at the front desk was quick and friendly on Thursday at 5:30 p.m. Friday night on the Memorial Day long weekend was extremely busy with line up. We asked for a room with a view. We were given room 2102 which looked directly upon the Superdome. The tv had a personal welcome greeting. We had 2 comfortable queen beds with various pillows, mini bar fridge & safe, the bathroom was clean and the shower accessories were lovely. Our stay included a complimentary breakfast each morning. The restaurant is full service. We had the choice of having the buffet or ordering from the menu. We chose the buffet which was $20.95 which as I said was complimentary. The buffet included a custom omelette station with lots of meat, veggie and cheese options; a hot food station with extensive choices such as scrambled eggs with cheese, several choices of bread puddings with warm caramel and chocolate sauces for drizzling, oatmeal, grits, bacon, alligator sausage, warm fresh biscuits, thick sliced ham with sauce; cold cereal bar; salad station with greens, dressings, sesame seeds, dried cranberries etc.; fresh cut fruit (melons, pineapple, strawberries, grapes); yogurt with side of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries & blackberries; a station with various cheeses (smoked gouda, goat etc), various deli meats, baby dills, etc. I've surely missed many items from the buffet but you get the picture. It was extensive and one of the best I've had in North America. Back to our stay, the elevators were unique with respect to operation. Our room key allowed access to a few floors (21 - where we stayed), the 3rd floor (restaurants) and 5th floor (pool). At the elevator area, there are 8 elevators labelled A - H, you scan your electronic room key on the electronic pad which will activate one elevator for your use. The electronic pad lights up a letter (either A - H) which tells you which elevator to use. Once you're on the elevator, it takes you directly to the floor you are staying on, hence, no buttons to push in the elevator. There were never any lengthy lines or long waits for an elevator. They run efficiently and quickly. Check-out can be completed at the front desk or electronically at terminals located in the lobby. If you had the complimentary breakfast, I would advise checking out at the desk. The reason being that as per hotel policy, breakfast will be billed to your room and deducted at checkout. It is my advice that you check your bill thoroughly before leaving the hotel as it is much easier to correct in person. As a footnote, our bill had not been adjusted. We brought it to the attention of the clerk at the front desk, who was most accommodating and corrected before we left the hotel. There are courtesy terminals in the hotel lobby where you can check flight information and perform an early flight check-in. Final notes: Bourbon Street is lively, especially on Saturday night. For dining, we highly recommend the Red Fish Grill for their crawfish boil. Pricing is very reasonable. The waitress took the time to show me how to take apart a crawfish and which part to each (first timer). Also, Felix's Restaurant @ 739 Iberville St. is family owned and has absolutely the best grilled oysters. Arrive early as you can expect line ups out the door for popular restaurants.

Well, seeing believes. Our check-in went quickly and without incident. Although the guests do have to go up a couple of escalators and past the restaurants to the elevator, we did not find that a problem. Our room was actually quite attractive. Accordingly, on first blush my husband and I thought that in fact, the very negative reviews of the hotel were undeserved. Well, when we turned on the air conditioning, it is fairly loud. TO be fair, it does not sound like a \"jet engine\", but does sound like one of those cheaper box fans you buy from almost any store that carries fans. The air also blows so hard it seems like a kind of wind machine is on in the room. However, the biggest problem is that it STILL doesn't cool the room. The thermostat read 71 degrees, but my husband and I were so uncomfortable and we figured out that it was because the air conditioning system was not taking the HUMIDITY out of the room. The lobby is very cool and dry, so I can't figure out why they can't cool the rooms. We were in room 2033 if you are taking room notes. Worst of all, our room was never cleaned. We stayed Friday night to Monday morning. When we arrived, the room looked clean. We left the room at 9:30AM Saturday morning and did not return until just before 5:00PM. Our room had not been cleaned. We were told the staff could come back at around 7:30PM. We re-arranged our dinner plans to be our early enough to have the room cleaned. Someone showed up at 7:00 when we were in the middle of dressing for dinner. Because we were not \"ready\" to have the room cleaned, we were told we could not get service that day. Sunday we left the hotel at 10:30 for brunch. We came back at about 3:30. The bed was made, but the floor had not been vacuumed. Upon closer inspection, we found that the bathroom had not been cleaned either. How did we figure this out? We had been running late for brunch, so my husband did a quick shave over the sink and didn't think to rinse it out. The beard stubble that he'd tapped out of the shaver was still in the sink. Towels were still in the bath tub where we'd left them to ensure we got a clean set. There is almost no excuse for not servicing room at all; there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for pretending to service a room by making the bed, but not doing the basic of rinsing out the sink and tub. I called down and the front desk gave me a one night credit, but there is no way to come back from this one. Finally as many have noted, there is no vending because they have a little sundries store on the second floor. This is the most expensive sundries store I have ever seen in a hotel and that is saying a lot! A granola bar that was less than an ounce (trial size) was $1.49; a regular size granola bar was $3.00. Because of the location, there is nothing else for small purchases around (closest pharmacy/walgreens/cvs is about eight really hot blocks away).

The hotel is very clean, but very large. To access your room from the front desk, plan at least 20 minutes. You need to go up two sets of escalators, then figure out the elevator situation, and if you are at the end of the hall (like me) it takes awhile.

I felt more secure knowing that only authorized people could access the guest floors. Yes, I know, someone could sneak on with a real guest, but I never felt unsafe in this hotel. Since this hotel was recently remodeled and reopened, there are virtually no cosmetic flaws. The food served at the conference was very good... especially the crawfish sauce that was served at breakfast one morning. I could have just had a bowl of that! The room was very comfortable and if I had to complain about any part of my experience, it would have been the loudness of the air conditioning. Each time it kicked on, it was loud.

House keeping did a good job giving us fresh towels and changing the sheets everyday. They did have one slip up on the last day however. They changed our sheets, made our bed but left the dirty sheets in a pile in the room. The major negative was hotel's Internet situation. They charge $19.95 a day!?

It has changed quite a bit since the last time my husband and I stayed at this hotel. However, I'm not sure all the changes were for the better. The hotel itself is nice and clean. However, the layout is very confusing and weird. You have to either take an elevator or escalator, then walk quite a distance, to access the hotel room elevators. It is quite a distance to get from the check in desk to your room. They use an electronic hotel key card system for their hotel room elevators, which is very confusing. The idea is great for security purposes, but a lot of guests seemed confused including myself. The hotel rooms are nice and clean. The beds were comfortable. I was happy to see a fridge in the room. The bathroom was standard size. I would have preferred the bathroom be a little bit larger and have a ventilation fan, but overall it was a nice bathroom. The check in process was fairly normal and was fast, but we did get there at a slow time. All staff members were curtious. Be aware that the hotel nickel and dimes you for everything. Internet is almost $15 a day. We paid $38 for valet parking. I don't think my husband realized that there were other parking options besides valet, so that was our own fault. We ate at one of the hotel restaurants called Borgne. It is a John Besh restaurant. The food and service was good. I would recommend trying it out. The hotel is rated a 3.5 star and my opinion is that it is like that of a 3 star. Our visit was during Jazz Fest, so the rooms were extremely overpriced. But all the hotels in the area were overpriced because of this. That happens wherever you go when there are large events. We did experience some issues during our stay. They put us in a room that had guests still inhabiting the room. So after getting to our room I had to take the long jaunt back to the check in desk to notify them of their error and all I got was a very weak apology and then had to be put into another room. I was not all too impressed with this situation. I don't think the people whose room we had access to would have been very pleased either. Even though it was an accident, you are comprising the security and safety of the guests room we accidentally had access to. Another issue was our room was not cleaned during our stay. We were gone most all of the day, so there are no excuses for not having our room cleaned. Since our room was not cleaned I had to call housekeeping for towels. I asked them for three large towels. After a very long wait housekeeping arrived with one large towel, two hand towels, and a wash cloth. I didn't realize this until after they had left. I had to call housekeeping again and request more towels. After waiting for yet another long period of time my husband had to call housekeeping again. After that phone call we waited yet again for another long period of time. My husband actually left the room to try and find a housekeeping cart, because he was so tired of waiting around. My husband is pretty laid back and easy going and he was pretty angry with the housekeeping service and it takes a long time for him to reach this point. This hotel is located in the Business District. We spent most of our time in the French Quarter. So if you plan on spending most of your time in the French Quarter, I would highly recommend getting a hotel that is within closer proximity to that area.

Disorganized check-in line -- not a unified approach but more old-style bank structure where you pick a line and see how it goes. Very lame. Get with the times, I recommend. Even the concept of picking a line was disorganized -- you couldn't tell who was working and who was not. 6. As other reviewers noted, water pressure very low but manageable (and understandable given the location). 7.

If you are having some kind of convention within the facility, or are just going to an event at the Superdome, you might appreciate it more than we did. But although we had no problem walking to the riverwalk area, then down to Bourbon St. for the night, then walking back to this hotel, we thought the amount of walking necessary to get from the front door into a room was beyond excessive. I get vertigo on escalators and we could find no other option to get to the elevators, which START on the 3rd floor. What do people in wheelchairs do? At one point, we took a wrong escalator and got stuck on the 2nd floor. Ended up having to go back up to get to correct escalator to get to the lobby. To get from the lobby to a room, one must ride a 2-story escalators, walk a fair distance between 2 restaurants, then scan your room key/card to summon an elevator. I also do not like glass elevators, the only apparent choice. There are no signs telling you which way to go for elevators, restaurants, exit, we never did see the concierge, and got lost either coming or going each of the 3 times we left our room. Several times we chatted briefly with other guests who also said they kept getting lost. They should give guests a map of the hotel. We never saw the pool except from our window, and it looked as far away as if it wasn't even in the same building. It was surrounded by a huge area with lounge chairs and really comfortable looking cabanas. If we had been there for a longer stay, I'm sure we would have loved spending some time out there in the shade on the padded furniture. Our bellhop was friendly but some of the other people working around the door were surly. Check-in was speedy and pleasant, but the lobby had a heavy vibe of being disorganized, rushed, on the verge of chaos with packed luggage carts taking up much of the surprisingly small space around the check-in desks (and blocking most of the light from outside). The staff, although almost all very pleasant people, seemed powerless to overcome this and I'm not sure they were aware of it. Not the sereneness and sense of calm proficiency one would expect in the lobby of a Hyatt. We found a parking lot right around the corner for $25/day which nobody in the hotel seemed to know existed. It was well worth it to us to walk a few more steps to save the additional cost of valet +tip, and we did not have to wait for our car this way or have strangers driving it (not a rental). Excellent: - seriously comfortable bed - ample covered area out front for unloading/loading - huge window - tv - 19th floor is very quiet - no paying for wi-fi unless you use it Not as good: - finding coffee upon awakening, none in room - no place for ladies to put their foot while shaving - shower only, no tub - no vent fan in bathroom - 1 washcloth for king room booked for 2 adults - no plastic laundry bag for dirty clothes - shower head was more of a mist than a shower, no adjustment - tiny bedside tables - water so \"soft\" that I never felt rinsed Just because they put their name on it, doesn't make it a Hyatt. I paid what they charged but don't feel like they kept up their end of things. If they need to charge more to offer the \"Hyatt experience\" then they should. For about $25 less, we could have stayed at one of the cheaper brands and had more amenities, breakfast included, treated about the same, bed not as comfortable, and used the savings to pay for a parking spot after driving into downtown (and still saved money.) Luckily there are other choices in the same price range in NOLA and now we know better. The whole giant building is non-smoking, it's a long time-consuming walk to get outside & back up every time you want to smoke. Something you won't enjoy after all of the other walking you'll probably do in this awesome city.

Once I worked out the elevator system, clever as it is I went to my room and was delighted to see that it was a great size, well appointed and laid out with everything I needed. Wireless was complimentry ( for one device only, anymore meant upgrading your wireless package $15 a day). The bar and restaurant staff overall were excellent.

There is a starbucks too in the conference area if you need a coffee and cake! The hotel also has a fantastic fitness center on the top floor so you can run on the treadmill looking out over New Orleans. This is a very comfortable hotel, grand in its appearence and really did exceed my expectation in nearly every way, yes there is a \"but\" coming.The parking is an issue, the only option available is Valet parking which is expensive at over $35 a day, adding tips to this every time you need the car adds up! There is a car park to the right of the hotel as you drive along the street, it has a board saying \"hotel parking\" but this has nothing to do with the hotel, its misleading.

The first thing we noticed was the stunning entrance/lobby. The front desk service was quite efficient at check-in, especially considering how busy it was when we checked in, but I didn't really like being told to take escalators to the third floor, and getting on the guest elevators there. It just seemed a bit of an odd design. There was a queue at the elevator, but that was the only time during our stay that we had to wait to use it, the rest of the time there were plenty of free ones. We figured out how to use it easily enough, although it was somewhat frustrating to choose your store number and have the H elevator immediately open up 20 metres away, forcing you to run to get to it on time. I loved looking out the glass walls as the elevator went up or down though. I made two calls to the front desk, one for help in adjusting our stay length, which they took care of with no fuss at all, the second time was to ask for help with the in-room internet, but nobody came to help. That was pretty disappointing. The room was very nice if a little smaller than I expected. The bed was sublime, but the water pressure was little more than a trickle, and I would have liked a coffee maker to be provided. The staff at the starbucks were lovely, but the use of space on those lower floors seemed a bit strange. There were just large sprawling expanses of walls and carpets. It just seemed a bit wasteful to have so much space not being utilised. We tried the restaurant and the breakfast buffet, and the food was just ok, and the staff were a little disinterested.

The parking is really expensive, $38 a night with no alternative, but the valet staff was very quick and pleasant. My only complaints would be that it took forever for the hot water to kick in. The hotel was at low occupancy so we were apparently alone in our area. The maintenance staff told us that since there was no one using the hot water but us it just took a while to get to us. My other complaint is that the air conditioner was ridiculously loud! They have done a wonderful job of refurbing the hotel from the storm, but clearly they could not redo all the plumbing and a/c.

They go the extra mile to reach out to guests and project friendliness and competence. Elevators- OK, this is a SMART Elevator system.

Of course, I'd rather not wait 10 minutes for a DUMB elevator system to get me up and down, and this place's system is state of the art. Parking-Very expensive Valet and not a lot of low priced options. The valet is over $30 and the attached garage is $25 if you park over 10 hours. There is a open parking lot across the street that is a bit cheaper. Diamond Members- You get access to the lounge (Regency Club), which is a great place to take in the view of the city and have a drink. The breakfast is continental, so if you like eggs and meat and such you are SOL. Evenings is cut up sandwiches like Muffaletta and other stuff , plus some veggies like mushrooms and carrots.

It was pretty frustrating. By far the MOST annoying feature of my ENTIRE stay was the elevators. I have never seen anything like it. You MUST scan your key to have it choose your floor. You can manually decide your floor from OUTSIDE the elevator, but in either case it \"directs\" you to what letter elevator you should get on, once you get on the elevator there are NO inside buttons, so you are stuck with wherever it takes you. This was cute at first, but over the course of the conference I realized how really terrible this design is. First, there was NO instruction outside the elevator on how to scan your key (we learned this from watching someone else do it.) Second, the elevator bases which letter elevator you get in based on how many keys are scanned. So when a group of us all wanted to go to the 11th floor, and another group wanted to go to another floor, it tried to put us on the same elevator. The only problem was with 2 key scans it was actually close to 20 people! The worst part was when large groups would try and get on the elevators at the same time (after they let out of a meeting, etc.) This process was pure chaos with scanning keys and listening for letter assignments. If you need to go to multiple floors (like drop a friend off, etc.) you are outta luck. It was SO frustrating. the one redeeming grace of the hotel was James, the concierge.

Then that afternoon at lunch (buffet style, again) they served right outside our meeting room (imagine the concept!) but they ran out of food!!! Gees!

Overall the experience was okay. Front Desk: Pleasant but efficient it is not. Our room type was not available when we checked in (at 6:15pm!!) so talked the girl into an upgrade to a suite. (We had an event at 7pm that we needed to freshen up for after traveling 10+ hours). That was about the best service we got. Some of the team were staying for a couple of days after the business meetings and were consistently told to ask to come back the next day to check if rooms are available. For my workmate and I, when we did find a room, we had to change rooms. That was fine though. I had brought AE Travelers Checks with me and EVERY time I want to change them...no-one on the front desk knew they could change them. One didn't even know what they were. What service are you in again? WOW!!! They had to consistently ask their manager on duty. I think some time training their front desk staff is overdue! Check out was quick so I will give them that. Rooms: Okay, but nothing great...especially for the $$$ they are asking for. Bathrooms are small, someone else mentioned the sub-standard toiletry's, and surprisingly...no extractor fan in the bathroom. So the mirror kept fogging up of course when one showers. Beds were comfortable though. TV's were decent. Only other gripe is that I am a late to bed person, so if you are like me, be warned...there is no room service after about 1am. There is a shop below though, but the food is pretty poor. Cleaners: Ummm....yeah!!! Stayed for five days in two rooms....saw one cleaner, once! As mentioned above, we got a suite upgrade when we checked in and had to order a cot as the suites only come with one bed. I like my workmate, but there is a line :) The cot arrived fine, but one would think to oh I don't know...say, provide sleeping things like...a blanket etc. Had to call FD to get them delivered. Not rocket science people. We are not pigs so it wasn't a messy room, but cleaning it once or twice and making the beds now and again would have been great. Someone else mentioned a newspaper delivered daily...what newspaper? They must have been one of the special people who had their rooms cleaned, beds made etc. Hotel Itself: Overall it is a nice hotel. The lounge/sports bar is nice. the bar food is good...for bar food. Staff are friendly. It is an atrium set up so very open. I guess some may have heard noise in their rooms but we didn't. The overall look is by far...better than their overall service! Location: I found the location fine. Close to the Superdome which was nice as we went to a Hornets v Mavericks game. I found the walk fine to Bourbon Street, pleasant and not dangerous at all. We even walked to and from the French Q which was also a nice walk. Not sure what some are talking about with it being dangerous...it isn't at all. However, if you are a girl alone, then yeah. For safety reasons it would be best to cab it. But no different than any other city. Overall: Okay hotel but would only come back if their was a smoking deal on rooms.

Sure enough, my faith was rewarded with obvious improvements in service over some reviews from December.

The service was excellent here as well.

I don't think this is a big deal, but as a long time Hyatt customer, this is not typical of Hyatt.

First, if you are going to a game at the Superdome there isn't a better choice. A true convention hotel, large hotel with services geared for thousands of guests. I would have no hesitation booking a huge convention at the Hyatt. The first impression is good, valet quickly took my car. Parking is expensive but unlimited in and out privileges. The front desk is modern with receptionists standing in front of their kiosks to welcome guests. The highest level of customer service training is evident. Easy check-in and quick directions to the guest elevator lobby. Up the escalator or elevator to the lobby level with a lobby bar, sports bar and restaurant. The elevator system is one of two in the US..the other at the Marriott Marqis in NYC. You wave your room key under a box at the end of the elevator bay. It will display an elevator..A, B, C, etc... The elevator then knows your floor and makes an express trip to your floor. (This high tech elevator system was not properly explained at check-in. A guest explained it when I.was looking for an up button that didn't exist). There were workers cleaning and touching up paint and trim. It is evident that the highest standards are expected by management for this hotel, it was clean and comfortable. My problems were with common sense and simple requests. I ate in the sports bar. The meal was good, not great. I had to send my wine back, it had the bouquet of bleach! I think the bar back forgot to rinse the glass after a bleach bath. The bar manager apologized and didn't charge me for this wine. Met this same bar manager the next night when at the lobby bar located across from the sports bar I couldn't get a red wine...I suggested they walk 15 feet to the other bar and get one from the sports bar. Another night I asked for a wine glass to take to my room and was told it would be in a plastic cup. When I questioned the statement, I was told on game days drinks are served in cups. No game and I was a sober lady in business dress who does not drink wine from a solo cup. Sometimes a lady would like a wine in the room rather than sitting alone in a bar. One apology later and I was on my way upstairs with a glass of wine. The next night I ate in the restaurant. Less than 15 minutes after being seated, the buffet was taken down without any notice. With shellfish allergies there wasn't much I could eat. My complaint to this same bar/restaurant manager was that someone should have either told me when I was seated or before they tore down the buffet that It would be removed at a specific time. No such notice was given any of the restaurant guests. Now for what was right...meeting rooms excellent, cool but very nice. The catering for meetings was superb, from Eggs Benedict with steak to New Oleans beignets our breakfasts were excellent. From breakfasts to lunch to cocktails the catering could not have been better. The hotel general manager spoke to our group. He is a man passionate about his hotel. He has seen it through Katrina to this long awaited reopening. I believe with his dedication that any service issues will soon be resolved. The guest rooms are very nice with an armoire and chair in a little foyer and behind this wall a luxurious bed, desk and chair with a nice reading lamp. I'd give the rooms and the bed very high marks. Again, if you are planning a convention, this is a perfect hotel. If you are attending a sporting event, perfect choice. If you are going to the French Quarter, you should plan for a taxi ride. There is construction in front of the hotel which will eventually bring the trolley line to the hotel.

To explain, yes, a couple waiters/waitresses were slow. Yes, a couple of the front desk people were difficult to work with. But I have faith in the Hyatt brand that they will filter through those people over the course of their ramp-up period and in no time at all, this hotel will be operating much more smoothly. The room was fantastic. We had a suite, spacious, great view. I don't know why there isn't a dresser, we had no where to put our clothes but on the couch and whatever we could hang up in the closet. But we didn't mind it too much. The restaurants/bars were great. really enjoyed the food and the prices. I like the location. Some people are complaining about the mile walk to the french quarter, but I'm a new yorker and I like that. burn off some calories and a couple beers each way. And you can avoid the hustle and bustle of the french quarter when you want to just take it easy for the night. Anyway, nice work to the owners for a job well done.

The renovations to the property itself are beautiful, but the service delivered is far from up to par. Check-in is chaotic and disorganized even for diamond members. Our club room has no luggage racks, no towel hooks or hooks of any kind in the bathroom, and other signs of just not being complete. The design of the rooms also have some issues such as the faucets not being long enough and barely clearing the back of the sink - washing hands is almost impossible without spilling all over the counter. The regency club is nicely appointed, but the entire bank of electrical outlets along the window wall are not activated making working with a computer or charging a phone difficult. You've been open over 3 months and haven't addressed something as simple as that? As a diamond member (as are any paying club room guests) we are entitled to complimentary breakfast and this morning we arrived at a few minutes after 9 amam and breakfast was over. No one told us a time at check-in and I just assumed a pretty standard 10 or 11 am, but no - 9 am! The other issue is that room service closes from 12-5 pm. You can't order lunch!?! In a new hyatt hotel this just seems incredible to me. We've asked for a few items at different times and staff said they'd take care of it and just disappeared never to be heard from again... My experience is every staff member I've spoken to just looks to send you to someone else to address your need - no one seems to want to take responsibility for anything to help a guest. If the reviews are pointing out the same things months after opening the cursory replies by management to reviews are clearly all they are doing to address it. Developing a organizational culture in a new property takes some time, but it is just simply not happening under current management. There are clearly top-down training problems that need fixing.

First of all looking at what they have done with the property since what the storm did, it's amazing what man can do. This is the best city location hotel I have stayed at so far in my life. The art and decor is great just the way everything is executed was just incrediable. Especially since they are recently opened, I can just imagine how much better it will be. Love the concept of the elevators I didn't even have to share them with anyone (wait why did they smell like mustard tho?) takes you directly to your floor quickly. Not to mention the whole ride up on the far side you can see the Super Dome (it was lit up green and red for Christmas). Our room was in the corner and gave us a spectacular veiw of the city on 2 sides it was amazing. Called for a toothbrush got it 15 minutes later. I lived at the concierge desk where Robert the nicest guy helped me find everything and get everywhere. Another employee a wonderful sales worker made sure everything with our stay was perfect. It really made our stay special and we are so grateful for it. The food was just great the lunch buffet isn't a buffet at all, it is just great food as the illusion of a buffet and the dessert selection on it will stop you cold in your tracks before you can even get to the quarter. A lot of people said the quarter wasn't in walking distance. It is really like a 5 minute crawl away through nothing but safe business neighborhoods. Unless your incrediably lazy which is fine to because a cab is $7 to the quarter, I however suggest the walk because you will eat so much food in New Orleans.

The internet thing seems simply cheap on their part and began to leave us with a feeling that we were going to be nickel and dime-d for everything. In fact, from the $38.00, per day, valet Fee (Not including a total of $5.00 tax per day) EVERYTHING in this property was only available at extra cost. Getting connected to the internet proved to be a VERY difficult process. Nowhere in the room were there any instructions for doing so. After a trip to the desk I was finally able to get instructions from the IT guru for the property (located not in the building but in Colorado) and log onto the service I had paid for. The most frustrating online experience I have had in many, many years though because the system constantly and intermittently lost internet service. I was able to stay connected to the network itself, but the network was not able to stay connected to the internet reliably. The hotel refunded the connection fee, of course, but that did nothing to help me do what I needed to do online. After the first night we left the room at 9AM and didn't return until 3:30 to freshen up for the evenings activities (New Orleans Bowl). The room had not been serviced when we arrived and in fact we had to call housekeeping to get someone to come to the room to service it.

I got through very quickly but somebody right down from me was clearly upset he had been waiting quite some time. Be aware that there is no elevator access to your room from the lobby area. If you are carrying your own luggage you have to go to the 3rd floor and transit a large atrium area to get to the elevators that take you to your room. The elevators are quick and technologically advanced. Request an upper floor room if possible. We requested a Regency Club room because we had a busy schedule and knew from past experience with Hyatt's clubs that we could skip a meal or two and just drop by the club lounge and grab a nice snack. We were very disappointed with this property's lounge. For a city with such a \"foodie\" reputation you would think that management would take some pride in offering excellent food in their lounge. We've stayed at Hyatt properties in Phoenix, Orlando, Atlanta, and elsewhere and have always had excellent food. This property was very disappointing! Our room was nice sized and was very comfortable. The TV is a large computer monitor and the remote a mouse. The technology was pretty cool! The bed was very comfortable.

That said, it is a brand new hotel - so I'm sure some of the issues will be quickly resolved. The check in procedure was a little chaotic. The counter is large and there's not really an organized line. I was waiting behind someone figuring that the next available receptionist would take the next person in line but someone who was coming from another direction just walked to the counter at the other end when it became available. It took me 15 minutes to get checked in. Another person in my group waited nearly half an hour. When someone in our group called down for her car, the valet brought around the wrong car and it took 30 minutes for the correct car to be delivered. Room service wasn't available during lunch hours. My guestroom was very nice - and obviously everything was brand new - but the attention to detail seemed to be lacking. The folder for the notepad on the desk had a pen but no paper. And at no point during my three night stay was the paper ever replaced. There was a refrigerator in the room but surprisingly no mini-bar - just a bottle of water in the closet. The elevator system is a bit quirky. If you're on one of the lower floors (I was on the 7th floor) you can't take an elevator directly to or from the gym. You have to go to either the 3rd or 5th floor and switch elevators. It would be helpful if there was one elevator from the gym that would let you access all floors. As for location, you're in the business district so it's quiet (even a bit deserted) at night and on weekends. You're really close to the Superdome if you're in town for an event and it's only about a 10-15 minute walk to Bourbon Street.

Since this hotel has been through hell and back since Katrina, I wanted so badly for it to succeed. Our stay, unfortunately, was wrought with service issues, and I doubt I'd recommend this hotel to others based on that. As other reviews have said, the hotel is gigantic. The renovation looks amazing, especially in the public areas. While we didn't eat in the restaurants or bars, they looked to be very popular and cool. A lot of the banquettes have their own private flat-screen tv; this could be the next best thing to actually watching a Saints game next door in the Superdome! We were \"upgraded\" to a suite, which wasn't really a suite in that it's all one room with a wall down the middle that separates the bed from the couch. Not really big enough to entertain in or anything, and no privacy between the bedroom and the living area. Nicely decorated, nonetheless. The service was really the low point of the experience. I feel awful saying that, because the staff seemed so excited and eager; they just didn't seem to have the systems or communication channels that would be required in a hotel of this size. There were swarms of front desk agents standing around the lobby ready to help customers; however, if I ever needed to call down to the front desk for anything, the phone would ring for 10 minutes before someone picked it up (I'm not exaggerating. The only reason we put up with it is that it would have taken 10 minutes to walk down to the front desk anyway; the hotel is that big). I was supposed to receive a welcome amenity of wine and cheese. The front desk agent told me it would be up about a half hour after I checked in; it never showed up. We ended up buying our own wine, so we called down to ask for a corkscrew. After I was asked if I was looking for \"the kind of corkscrew that opens wine\" (I assured her that yes, this was the intended use of the corkscrew), I was told us that they weren't sure if they had any (!). A housekeeper showed up twenty minutes later with water glasses and told us \"they're still looking for a corkscrew\". We didn't hear from anyone else after that. We ran out of toilet paper (as soon as this happened, I realized that this rather unfortunate situation has never happened to me in a hotel before). 10 minutes of ringing, finally someone picked up...\"yes, yes, we'll be right up with toilet paper\"...and then nothing. (At the risk of getting too personal, I was lucky that there was a box of tissues in the room.) A panel in the ceiling of the shower fell out right before I got in...10 minutes of ringing...I asked them to hurry because we had dinner reservations...\"I'll send someone right up,\" I was promised...someone showed up a half an hour later. By then, I had already had given up on the shower and just went out to eat unwashed. (Again, this review is making neither the hotel nor my resulting hygiene look particularly good. Blech.) At checkout, the front desk agents seemed shocked that I didn't receive the welcome amenity and promised a barrage of Hyatt Gold Passport points instead. I have yet to see this reflected in my account, leaving the taste in my mouth even more bitter. I know a lot of these things seem so trivial, but when every need or request you have results in some sort of service failure, it starts to get frustrating. And this was on a weekend; I can't imagine how this hotel is going to be able to deal with conventions.

There is no free internet regardless of whether you use your own computer or the fancy TV. The rooms are very small. I thought I was in NY because the room couldn't fit 2 adults. The bathroom is really weird. The faucet is too close to the edge so your hands cannot fit under the faucet. It was a huge mess of water when I tried to wash my hands and face. There is no toilet paper holder. The toilet paper sits on the counter so the first time I washed my hands I ruined the toilet paper because I got it all wet. The toilet is so close to the ledge that the seat does not stay up if you are a male trying to pee. The hotel does need to hire more housekeeping staff. We left the room early in the morning and came back at 4pm to change and they hadn't cleaned our room. They had 7 people to open the door but they couldn't afford 2-3 people to clean rooms? The other issue is the loud AC unit that can wake you up every time it turns on. I couldn't hear the TV because the AC was so loud. The Starbucks was good and the store next to it had some good pastries if you need something quick to start your day. The valet was pretty easy. No major issues considering there were plenty of people standing around. The bathroom is a big deal breaker. No toilet paper holder, it took us 10 minutes to get hot water (such a waste of water), only one vanity with no space in the room to have another mirror to put make-up on or even dry your hair. Towels are under the sink because there is no room for a towel rack. The toilet seat is high so short people will be uncomfortable sitting on it. It was just a weird bathroom.

The differences are definitely noticeable. There is no longer a ramp attaching it to the Superdome, there are more restaurants on the property, more convention space and all personnell from bell staff to reception to maid service are noticeably \"guest friendly\" and it is larger. We drove to New Orleans for a college football game and used the parking valet. The valet staff was courteous, friendly and helpful, but the service was s-l-o-w! That being said, keep in mind the hotel had reopened just 2 days prior to our arrival so I am sure there were some bugs still to be addressed. The parking charge is pretty steep at $38.00 per 24 hour period. You do not have to pay in-and-out fees. You can request your vehicle as often as you want for the 24-hour fee. We chose the Regency Club room category and were well pleased with our choice. Access to the Regency Club Room was the star attraction. A breakfast listed as \"continental\" was included but the offerings were definitely \"continental plus\". Also included were evening hors d'oeuvres that were generous enough not to warrant going out for dinner. We had been sightseeing all morning and attended a football game in the afternoon and by the time we returned to the hotel we really didn't want to fight the crowds downtown so the Regency Club Room was very welcome. There was a Saints game on Sunday and the traffic was getting pretty heavy by the time our game was over. For those of you who are Starbuck's groupies there is one on the 2nd floor. And for those who prefer a full buffet breakfast the \"8 Block Restaurant\" on the 3rd floor is amazing! We had the buffet breakfast the first morning we were there in error. As I said before, there were still a few bugs to be addressed and this was one of them. When we checked in we asked where we should go for the continental breakfast and were directed to the \"8 Block\". After going through the buffet line (you can also order from the menu if a buffet is not your style) and speaking to our server, something just didn't seem right. After breakfast, I went down to reception and was able to speak to someone who told us about the Regency Club Room and removed the charge for the buffet breakfast from our bill. There are several more restaurants on property, including a sushi restaurant. There is also a sundries shop selling everything from pastries and souvenirs to toothpaste. The hotel is a short distance from Union Station if anyone is traveling by train. If you want to be in the middle of the \"action\" in the French Quarter, it wouldn't be considered walking distance unless you really liked to walk, but if you're attending an event at the Superdome it can't be beat! Now, on the technical side, the 37\" tv/computer monitor had a great picture...but for those of us who were born waaaay before computers, we had to have a technician in twice, but they worked on it Saturday while we were out and had it fixed by the time we got back. I opted not to purchased the internet package. We weren't staying long enough to pay the fees. The fees apply whether you use your own laptop or the in-room internet. The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the shower was great and we had plenty of hot water and towels. We had no problems with plumbing. Another concern was the A/C. It was noisy.

The Hyatt has been closed since Katrina, and has been completely gutted and renovated, it's located right next to the Superdome. I was familar with the property as it existed prior to Katrina, but had never stayed in this Hyatt. They have done a great job with the renovation- it is a huge hotel (>1000 rooms) and has the feel and vibe of a hip Las Vegas property. The lobby is impressive - lots of check in counters and a very modern feel. You have to go up 2 escalators (or an elevator) to the main floor where there are several restaurants and a few bars. It's very open, modern (again a Las Vegas vibe). We ate at both the bar and the main restaurant, Block 9. We had drinks/Apps at the bar, Vitascope, which were good - the most impressive thing is the large beer selection and specialty drinks. They also offer a sushi bar in this area - we didn't try the sushi but it looked good. For just opening, the bar areas were already a happening scene. The rooms are on the small side - but are nice and modern. The bathroom is tight (only 1 sink in a double room) but nicely appointed. We had a room on the 18th floor and had an awesome view of the new lighting show at the Superdome (Now the Mercedes Benz Superdome). Service at the hotel was good - the staff are excited that the hotel is open and were very helpful. The buffet breakfast in the restaurant, 8 Block, was good - an omelet bar, lots of 'artisan' type dishes, and local southern specialties - andouille sausage, cheese grits, etc. The hotel is still working out a few kinks - the valet took a long time to return the car, and the servers in the restaurant are just learning what to recommend, etc. but overall they did a great job for the second day! The area where the Hyatt is located is the North Central Business District - and the closest hotel to the Mercedes Benz Superdome - so it will be the premier hotel for anyone attending a game, or any event at either the New Orleans Arena or Superdome . There are several bars and restaurants in the Hyatt, and there are a few bars/restaurants within walking distance - 'Walk-ons Bistreaux' (a big new sports bar) and 'Happys' another sports type theme restaurant. Both are on Poydras St. and are great choices for drinks/casual dinner. I've heard that Ste. Marie restaurant (former Cuvee chef) is great and is also within walking distance on Poydras. I believe that Champion Square (which is next door to the Hyatt) is also opening some restaurants (including Drago's the place to go for grilled oysters) Since the area is not that busy at night after business hours, and when there are no game/events, I would recommend not walking to/from the French Quarter at night. It's a short shuttle or cab ride away. If you're looking for a hip, modern hotel this would be the place to stay in New Orleans. This hotel would be a great choice for anyone looking for a 'Vegas vibe', or who is attending an event or sporting event at the arenas. Would also be a great choice for a corporate conference/meeting hotel as they have lots of brand new meeting space. One final note: they have the newer type elevator systems with a keypad where you enter your floor and a verbal prompt in English directs you to the correct elevator which will take you to your floor. There are NO BUTTONS in the elevator itself. While this didn't present a problem for us, we did have several people walk on to our elevator thinking they could hit the button inside - and this is not the case. Also - if you don't speak English I imagine this may be confusing....", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hyatt Regency New Orleans", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d2346512-Reviews-Hyatt_Regency_New_Orleans-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$137 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">601 Loyola Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70113 </span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2346512", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/2f/4c/c7/hyatt-regency-new-orleans.jpg"}}
