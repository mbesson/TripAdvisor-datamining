I confess that at first I was a little scared of the location and exterior appearance of the building, but ultimately, I wanted to be in contact with the atmosphere of the old Byzantine capital, and I could not have conditions like in a hotel in Belek. My initial impression was quickly changed by the fact that I met people smiling and very nice inside, clean and warm room and a healthy and substantial breakfast. Throughout my stay at Gedik Pasha Konagi Hotel, staff was very attentive and willing to give me any information about the activities that were going to undertake. So if you want to go visit the historical center of Istanbul and not have special demands for luxury, my advice is to choose unreservedly Konagi Gedik Pasa Hotel.

From the moment you arrive, in our case late at night, Ozgur and his friendly and approachable staff team make you feel welcome and cannot do enough to ensure that your stay is wonderful.The rooms are well appointed, clean and spacious. The location is excellent for sightseeing , literally five minutes walk from the tram, bazaar, and restaurants and a short walk to the old and the staff are extremely knowledgeable about Istanbul. This hotel sets itself apart from others for the standard of service and the staff's genuine care for the well being of their guests.

Staff all extremely polite and friendly and were always around to offer advice about what to see in Istanbul or how best to get there. The room we stayed in was compact but everything was newly renovated and smelt new too! Bed was very comfortable and the shower to die for! :) Breakfast was nice, a good selection of bread, yoghurt, olives, fruit, cheese etc and lovely Turkish coffee. Also worth mentioning is the free tea and coffee provided by the hotel, one phone call to reception and it's delivered free to your room. Ironing board, iron and toiletries can also be provided free of charge if needed too and also free wifi! Cannot wait to return to Istanbul and when I do I will most definitely be booking in here again.

The staff has been wonderfully accommodating and nice. The room is clean and very comfortable. The private bath is very modern and clean. The grand bazaar is a close walk as are many other destinations we wanted to visit. The internet worked great as well, a big plus since our phones didnt receive data in Turkey. Really a great little hotel and we will definitely stay here again in the future. Also, thank you to the staff for their hospitality.

The hotel is located on a narrow street - the uphill walk to which gets you to the Grand Bazaar (in 15mins). There are a lot of local shops around the hotel too, especially shoe stores.The hotel lobby is tiny and has a rustic feel to it. The underground restaurant is beautiful, in an old-fashioned sense and feels like you are dining in a medieval cave. The breakfast was average, with not much variety. There are no elevators in the hotel, and so we climbed two floors up a spiral staircase to get to our room. The room was clean, decently sized, with wooden flooring, a nice big bed and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was clean too. The staff were very helpful, and eager to please. I would recommend living here if you would like to be close to the main attractions of the city - Grand Mosque, Sultan Ahmet, and Blue Mosque.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel in the heart of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Angel504", "ReviewID": "UR117390467", "Content": "I stayed one week at The Gedik Pasa Konagi Hotel and I need to admit is one of the best hotels that I ever stayed in Istanbul.

There is an stylish cave-restaurant at the basement of the hotel with an incredible ambiance. Their staff is multilingual and willing to help at all times in anything you may need.

The hotel has a great boutique atmosphere and is situated in an interesting neighbourhood with few tourists, but many local shops. The room was very nicely appointed with a wooden floor and spacious clean bathroom and air conditioning. The hotel itself is in an old and quirky building and there is a vaulted restaurant in the basement level. Staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. Bear in mind there is no lift though and the restaurant does not serve evening meals, however there are many restaurants within very easy walking distance. The tram is only a few hundred yards at the top of the street near the Grand Bazaar. The hotel is in a small area with many shoe workshops and retailers and is a bit different from the run of the mill tourist honeypot. The location was a little difficult for taxi drivers to find, a small inconvenience, but the hotel is not too far from the airport. (35-40TL) The location is also on a steep street which may be a consideration.
