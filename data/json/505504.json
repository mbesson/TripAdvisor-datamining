It's very accessible, located near the main road where you can ride a cab or a bus, it's also a 20 minute walk going to Kallang Mrt Station. The room was very small. We got a room with a queen sized bed, a flat screen tv, aircon, toilet.. That's about it. No safety deposit box, no fridge. There were only 8 channels on the tv, no soap, no shampoo, and the toilet was smelly!!! There was also only one trash bin! The rug outside the toilet was also very dirty.

It is indeed true that Geylang area is known as \"the red light district\" of Singapore...But this is a place where you'll also find cheap foods. Getting to the hotel is fairly easy, the hotel is just about 10-15mins away from Aljunied Station. If you ask for directions people in the area would know where the Fragrance Hotel - Pearl is right away. On the way to the hotel you'll see people hanging outside bars. The food stalls which sells cheap foods also sells liquors. As you would notice during evening the whole Geylang area is busy however come the next morning everything is quiet. As for me and my friend, walking in the area during morning and late evening is quite safe. I guess one just needs to dress properly not to be mistaken as one of the \"other girls\" around there. As for the hotel itself, its pretty neat, there's TV(with few channels), hot&cold shower, free water and coffee plus electric kettle and hair blower. Wi-fi service is not for free,it costs SGD5 per 2 hours which is like Php170 (roughly in Philippine Peso), I find this quite expensive at first but when I asked and looked around for cheaper ones I realized that this is kind of cheap plus you can use internet in the comfort of your own room rather than in internet cafes.

I've never experienced a dirty room @ 5:30 pm, and this is very inconvenient when you are jet-lagged and want to sleep but now they want to get in and clean. In the morning, the pipes and thin walls will get you awake more effective than the non-existent wake up call I requested. The bed is nice and firm but has unfitted sheets which are constantly coming undone and threatening to have you sleep on cold vinyl. The A/C works great. The front desk is actually quite professional considering the hotel. The hotel's location is great during the week. Two MRT stations, cheap beer, good food, and a wide range of locals are nearby.

First you need consider how much you are paying, which at the Fragrance Pearl, is about 75% less than the overpriced name brands in Singapore. Also, consider that hotel is being freshened up (I would not say renovated) and the paint was still wet when I was there (which may explain some of the differences with the previous reviews). The hotel is entirely non-smoking. The rooms are smallish, and Spartan, and the bathroom is one room for the shower, toilet, and sink with some amenities. There is a large flat screen TV with several English channels. The bed is comfortable, but not the one you would get in a Hyatt. Wireless is available for a $4 for a two hour session. You must return the TV and air conditioner controls when you check out. My room was on the backside so it was quiet, but you can easily hear talking in the corridor. The staff is friendly and was helpful with every question and request. S\u2019pore is not my favorite city because it is so squeaky-clean and new. The hotel\u2019s district, on the other hand, is one of the most interesting. The main street has hundreds of restaurants in colonial buildings that have taken over the sidewalk. The side streets, including the one in front of the hotel, have lots of prostitutes. The girls stay away from the hotel front door (on the other side of the street) and none ever approached me, so there must be some rule against direct hustling. If the Pearl was ever a place for fun and games, it seems to discourage it now, most seem to opt for the $6/hour hotels down the street. There seem to be police all around, so I consider the place quite safe\u2026and a great place for people watching. The hotel is about 9 miles from SIN and a $10 taxi ride ($15 from midnight to six) and takes about 20 minutes with no traffic. It is also a few blocks away from a subway station (which does not start running until 7AM, too late for the American flag carrier departures and stops too early for their arrival at midnight). Note that there are several Fragrance hotels, including the Sapphire, which is one street over. This is absolutely an inexpensive two-star hotel, so if you are used to four and five star hotels (as I am) you should consider the Pearl a fun place to \u201crough it\u201d, save some money , and protest the high rates at the big name hotels", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Glos", "Title": "\u201cBasic, but comfortable and good value.\u201d", "Author": "PeterEdwards", "ReviewID": "UR59808910", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights on my second trip to Singapore. Yes, it is basic and a little ways out from the central areas but it is clean , comfortable and good value. It is easy to get anywhere from this hotel as Kellang MRT is only 10 mins walk away and trip from Raffles Place need only take 25 minutes to hotel door. To stay in the down town areas would cost more than twice as much for similar comfort. The hotel rooms are on the smaller side, but quite adequate if just being used overnight. Area outside hotel is in red light district, but no worse than many other such districts in cities around world, and as being in Singapore is perfectly safe. If to stay in Singapore for only couple of nights en route further, would suggest pay the expense for comfort and convenience of a higher rated hotel in main area, but if to be longer and have a budget then this hotel is a good option.

I can't afford luxury and when I travel I want to experience LOCAL CULTURE and SEE THE SIGHTS, so I'm not going to spend much time in my hotel, except for sleeping. Yes, Singapore's Red Light District was a bit of a shock to start with, but I came to love that district, and the MRT in that city is SO FAST, SO CLEAN, and SO CHEAP, you really can be just about anyway, VERY quickly. The first time I stayed there I didn't know ANYTHING about the Red Light District, until the taxi driver taking me there from the Airport asked me if I'd stayed there before, and when I said \"No\", then asked if I knew what that part of Singapore was famous for. It was late evening when we arrived and I experienced \"Baptism by Fire\" ! I had booked into the Frangrance Pearl at the very last minute, because the Hotel I had booked (AND PAID FOR) suddenly announced that they were overbooked and couldn't offer me a room, just One Day before I was due to fly ! The Frangrance Pearl HAD a room available, and Lucky Me it was even cheaper than the place that had let me down. My second biggest shock (after discovering what a REAL Red Light District was) was what you got as \"Inclusive Breakfast\" !!! After dumping my bags in my room and having an ABSOLUTELY LOVELY and MUCH APPRECIATED Shower, I returned to Reception to ask \"Where's the Restaurant ?\" The Manager looked at me with a puzzled look on his face. \"The brochure said I get Breakfast Included\" I said, \"So where do I take it, and what time is the restaurant open ?\" He got a cellophane wrapped biscuit ..... \"Layer Cake\" it said on the wrapper. \"This is Breakfast\", he said, \"You should have this and coffee in your room.\" I'd seen the \"Layer Cake\" in my room and assumed it was just something to NIBBLE along with drinking coffee ! Did I say \"COFFEE\" ??? The \"Three In One\" (supposedly coffee, whitener and sugar combined) produced a kind of cross between Yucky Coffee and Drinking Chocolate when you poured boiling water on it. It's strange coz on day one I HATED the stuff and threw most of it away. By the following year I was drinking the stuff like a seasoned visitor. I still have one of those \"Layer Cake\" Breakfasts, that I show to friends who are thinking of going to Singapore ! One day I returned to my room at the end of the afternoon to find that my room hadn't been serviced. I went down to reception and complained to a gentleman who I later discovered was the Manager, and with whom I became friends, until he moved to a larger hotel within the group. The speed and efficiency .. and SMILES and APOLOGIES .... with which my room was serviced would have been a CREDIT to any hotel ! The maid was already in my room stripping the bed by the time I had stepped out of the lift on my floor. She asked me to wait out side, and in just a few minutes she had replaced ALL the linen, cleaned the bathroom and topped up all the supplies, dusted all the furniture, topped up all the refreshments and used a dust mop over the floor. With a lovely smile, she curtsied, said something in her language that I didn't understand, and gestured that I should enter my room and inspect it. She didn't leave until I had confirmed that everything was to my liking.

We only booked in for 2 nights at first, after which we booked to stay another 3 nights so I think that is instantly a good show for the place. It was clean with towels & a soap/shampoo combo dispenser in the bathroom though the hot water did run out on me a couple of times, seemed to be affected by the time you took your shower as other times it was fine. The 2 female receptionists were very welcoming, the male staff just average. It is indeed in the red light district of Singapore so if you have issues with things like this it's probably not the area for you, though it feels just as safe as anywhere else in Singapore. The hotel also does cater to people buying a room by the hour but we just found it quite amusing rather than anything else & only saw 1 couple checking in for this, the prostitutes of Singapore look like any other person on the street alot of the time so who cares? The surrounding streets are bustling like I have never seen anywhere before - we arrived on National Day & presumed it was like this because of that but our taxi driver informed us it was always like that & he was right, week days & weekends included, every night the place has an almost constant public holiday feel about it. To us it felt like the Amsterdam of Asia (if you've ever been). We were the only white faces 99% of the time but no-one was bothered by us being there & if we went to any of the numerous food courts selling the cheapest food we found throughout Singapore (including the supposedly cheap Chinatown & Little India - this area is even cheaper) staff were out helping us & making us feel welcome. We didn't feel intimidated at any time (as we have in other countries in local type areas) & we would happily go back. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Aljunied MRT (subway/metro) station if you need a reference point on any maps & is very easy to get to.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Fragrance Hotel - Pearl", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d505504-Reviews-Fragrance_Hotel_Pearl-Singapore.html", "Price": "$54 - $70*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">21 Lorong 14 Geylang</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">398 961</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "505504", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/28/4c/284c15760c5ff3c344ed69214d4e84cf5large.jpg"}}
