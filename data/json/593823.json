We arrived early in the morning and they checked in and provided us with breakfast at no extra cost. When asked for a room change later in the day (the streetfacing room was quite noisy), they did accomodate that request as well. The room is decent sized and was clean & comfortable. They do provide toiletries (if possible get your own toothbrush & paste, the one they give is too small to use) and bathroom slippers. Few things to note about the room are - Small TV with only Turkish Channels (I am sure you wudnt travel all the way to Istanbul to watch tv, so you needn't bother), No Mini Bar, No AC (In Summer it could get real painful), there was a safe (but how safe the safe was, was a concern). If you can overlook these concerns, the room is absolutely fine. The breakfast is almost the same everyday. Not a great choice but it is manageable. The hotel has a small health club (few equipments), free access to their Sauna and Hamam (additional charges for personlized services like massage - 115 Turkish Liras, scrub etc.) The downside to this hotel is the location. Though it is near to the Pazartekke tram stop, it is a good 6 to 7 tram stops away from Sultanahmet. Please be aware that most of the monuments are in and around the Sultanahmet area. Though the frequency of the trams are quite good (one in every few minutes), the trams are normally crowded and could be painfully slow. It could take 20 minutes to reach Sultanahmet area. But due to the crowd in the tram, those 20 minutes could take forever. Taksim square is quite a distance from the hotel and if you get late you will have to take a taxi (last tram is around 00:00 hours) from the square and it could get expensive. So the location could be a concern. If you book from their hotel website, they do provide free pick up and drop to the airport. But it is good that you confirm this personally with the manager. They did try to charge me for the airport drop though i booked from their website. I had to speak to their manager to get this issue resolved (but this delayed me by 15-20 minutes for the flight!). You should try to reach their manager directly over the phone (some follow up required), email responses do take considerable time. Overall if you get his hotel in a decent price, go ahead and book it. Else you should look around for some decent hotel in the Sultanahmet area (Will save you precious time and liras on travel). Few Tips on Istanbul (Not related to the hotel review) 1. Do not exchange money in the airport. They charge 4% commission. Do it in the numerous exchange offices in the city at no commission. 2. Trams do not use Akbil any more. You will have to buy a Istanbul Kart. The deposit charges vary from kiosk to kiosk (7 Liras to 10 Liras). The savings are marginal if you are there only for 3-4 days if you take a Istanbul Kart. Also there is a risk that all kiosk owners do not refund the deposit and there is no guarantee that you will get your full deposit. 3. Trams/Ferries operate only until 00:00 Midnight. Decide and agree on the fare before taking a taxi. 4. Best place to stay is in and around Sultanahmet area.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cvery comfortable\u201d", "Author": "nicu_11", "ReviewID": "UR117931878", "Content": "4 stars're on a really good price as a central breakfast such a variety of appropriate staff and very good quality cleaning", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florianopolis, SC", "Title": "\u201cIt was amazing!\u201d", "Author": "saito75", "ReviewID": "UR117537151", "Content": "Everything in the hotel was excelent The room was very big - the bed was comfortable The breakfast was rich and tasty The service was wonderful We will recomend this hotel to our friends.", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for easy access\u201d", "Author": "Leannamarie63", "ReviewID": "UR117172653", "Content": "Location of this hotel to public transport (the train) was brilliant. Watch belongings on the train as we were robbed within a minute of getting on, trains are jam packed. Was very easy access to all the great tourist sites. The couple of minutes walk from the hotel to train was easy but you had to watch where you walked as very bad footpaths, holes in sidewalk and debris lying around. First impression of the area was not good. Bit of a distance to travel from the airport. Reception staff were lovely and helped with information as much as they could. The staff (all three ladies) from the Turkish Bath area a couple of floors down were not able to communicate at all in english with me. They missed out on customers because of this problem. Did not have any idea what I was asking even though I tried to show with signs using my hands - washing, shower etc. Had no idea what I was asking for when I said \"toilet\". Breakfast dining area had tables situated around the indoor pool. The variety and presentation of the food was more than adequate. Bedding and towels were clean but the rest of the room required a good clean. Moved the bed as I dropped my pen, the floor was covered with dust and there was a used condoms lying there.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Thessaloniki", "Title": "\u201cUsual Average 4star\u201d", "Author": "Vasios", "ReviewID": "UR101824783", "Content": "Stayed there as part fo a group of 15 people so I can't really comment on the value for money as I don't know what is their usual walk-in price. The hotel is a typicall 4 star average hotel. Nothing impressive, nothing really dissapointing. First room we were offered wasn't cleaned well and we asked for a change which was done in 5 minutes with no hassle. The hotel offers free sauna/turkish bath, I can't really comment on the quality of the facilities since I haven't been to many more but they seemed nice to me. Location is not great but there is a tram station just 30 meters from the hotel which can take you to Sultanahment (Blue Mosque, Agia Sofia etc) in 20 minutes. Our roum was very hot for no apparent reason (heat was off) so we had trouble to sleep.

Lovely little secluded outdoor seating area for smokers where one could order drinks from the reasonably priced bar, not often found elswhere. We will definitely return next September, hopefully for longer than 4 nights. Thank you for such a wonderfully warm welcome. But one downside to the area in which the hotel is situated: if you are a cat lover you will need to close your eyes to the very many pitiful strays.

The staff was extremely friendly, especially the waiters and busboys. The staff (except for the reception) doesn't speak very well english but you can easily understand them if you pay enough attention, but they speak excellent german and russian. The rooms are very large and very nice decorated and if you get a room in the east side of the hotel you will have a great view over Istanbul's skyscrapers. The distance to the historical area isn't great only 3,4 tram stations. The tram is air conditioned and goes very fast (10-15 min to Sultanhmed), comes very quickly (every 2 min) and the ticket costs 1,5 lyra (it's more than the bus ticket but it's totally worth it) . The hotel has free parking which is great because it can take you hours to find a parking place in Istanbul (unless you take your car to a garage) and the gas station is nearby. Also there is a little mousque near the hotel but don't worry about the noise because they only make the call on the speakers that the all sermon.

I expected to be not so far from Sultanahmet as they said, but in fact it hasn't a good location. Our room was very big, which I liked, beds are also big and confortable, the room is elegant but we didn't find even a bottle of water and they never put something in the bar. The bathroom is nice, with a lot of shampoons, conditionners, soaps but the shower didn't work proprely and same the hairdryer had a hole so i was afraid not to electrocute myself. But we had new slippers which was very nice. We couldn't use internet also we had a laptop, we had an argue with the receptionist on this aspect and finally he accepted to let us use internet for one hour, once, not every day of course. He said that we can use their computer from the lobby but it was all the time busy there and no privacy because everybody could watch the monitor. The brekfast was some kind of poor food, same every day, nothing traditional and not enough food for everybody because if you wake up a little later surelly you will not find nothing and they even don't care and also I didn't like the caffee. For food I can give 2 stars to this hotel. It also has a pool but was very cold so nobody could use it. The personal is not very friendly, they look you suspicious every moment and you can't see even a smile on their faces so you can feel embarrased every moment althoug one of the personal's members when we had a problem with our door because the key card was blocked(another problem) he came after us because he saw we are girls and asked for our mobile telephone number which I couldn't believe he can dare this. But the hotel is elegant and the elevators are very modern. The location of the hotel is also not very good, you can not find nothing near, but the tram station is almost near the hotel, just 1 minute walking away and there are like 9-10 stations to Sultanahmet, but if you want to come back to hotel after midnight you can use only a taxi which it will be expensive.

This hotel is in Topkapi, which is literally just a 15 minute drive by taxi to Sultanahmet, which is close enough! Before booking, I emailed the manager as some reviews on trip advisor worried me e.g. transfers to and from airport are not free, breakfast is awful, rooms unclean....but I was assured by the manager that this is not the case. As promised we were greeted at the airport by our comfortable transfer to the hotel. The hotel has decent sized rooms, simple but sufficient, with a clean bathroom (a must!!). There is a pool, gym and sauna, all free for guests..and facilities to pay for a massage or turkish bath. Breakfast was simple but had more than enough for all tastes... Any queries were promptly answered by the manager, who was very accommodating.
