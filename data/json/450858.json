The hotel wa at about 15% occupancy during our stay, so very quiet again.There were a couple of changes this time, but overall once again we found the hotel great value for money  the staff are lovely. The pools are as great as ever, and the hotel still very comfortable and clean.My 2 daughters and I used the spa on this visit for the first time. It was not only very, very inexpensive but of a great standard. We each had a pedicure  manicure as we sat under a hut by the pool. The girls in the spa served us lovely ginger tea  all up it was 1 3/4 hours of total relaxation  pampering, and ended with nail polish  being left to relax afterwards, returning to our room at our leisure. Upon arrival there was a letter in our room offering the manicure or pedicure for just US$6 each, well below the usual spa rates, and a great bargain! We will definately use their services again next time.One major change since our last visit was that the buffet breakfast had been replaced by an ala carte breakfast (included in the room), and this suited us fine. Everything was fresh  the food is great. We pushed the limits, ordering most things on the menu - in one sitting they were happy for us to have eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, fruit, pancakes, pastries, hot chocolate, fruit juice, etc. And although the breakfast voucher was for 2 people, they didn't charge for the children - they just said No, children free in room - I hadn't expected it to include breakfast, but when we thought about it we ealised that it was probably also the case on our last visit.As I've said, it's a great value hotel  would be great for families and couples alike, just not for anyone looking for loads of people to meet or a party atmosphere.", "Date": "Jul 3, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR199478904", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Dromomaniac"}, {"Content": "\u9288\u70bd\u5063\u9289\u581b\u511c\u9289\u66d8\u5050\u9289\u7b3a\u512a\u9289\u70bd\u5063\u951b\u044d\u96c6\u951b\ue224\u6fc0   showReview(19164065, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR874015005", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u93c8\u20ac\u7ef2\u509b\u68e9\u9287\ue0a2\u57c4\u9422\u3123\u4ed0\u9287\u4ff1\u4ed0\u9287\u71b4\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(19160011, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR526655741", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7ef1\u72b3\u66a4\u9287\ue04e\u7ee9\u951d\u5fe5\u7d8c\u951d\u5483\u7d84\u9287\u0441\u4eda   showReview(19155427, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR581535968", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u7039\u5908\u4eb1\u9287\uff43\u4ee7\u9287\ue1ba\u4ef9\u704f\u5fcb\u4ecc\u9287\ue042\u5127...   showReview(19928219, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 22, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR849956302", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "0", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d450858-r15166758-Sari_Segara_Resort-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "450858", "Price": "$280"}}
