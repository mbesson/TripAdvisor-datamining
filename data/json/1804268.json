Rooms offer limited space for your luggage so travel light. Hotel, as many previously have mentioned, is very, very clean and fresh with spotless bedsheets and facilities. Book your room high to admire the beautiful horizon over the area. One of the main disadvantages is lack of proper bar/pub inside, the other is lack of hair drayers or TV/radios in the rooms. Instead you are offered the 24-hour free connection to the internet in the common room which becomes problematic when other guests are having there party on the spur of the moment. The lobby is just too small to cater for everybody.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent budget option\u201d", "Author": "chalk_11", "ReviewID": "UR121696954", "Content": "I stayed for 3 nights in December on a cheap flight+hotel deal. The room was modern and very clean. As mentioned by others, it seems to be aimed at younger travellers so there are not really any frills (TV/kettle/etc), though towels are provided. I think it compares very favourably with budget hotels I have been to in terms of cleanliness and fittings. The beds are a little hard but I found them comfortable. There is internet available in the lobby and you can pay for wifi in your room. Staff were very helpful and spoke good English. Didn't try the breakfast but it looked decent. There is not much in terms of restaurants in the immediate area but the hotel is located on the tram line, a few minutes walk from the U-bahn station and is within ~15 mins walk of what you could consider to be 'central' Berlin. The area seemed pretty safe after dark. Overall, I would say this is a very good option for a place to stay in Berlin on a budget, for someone who wants to spend their time exploring the city and then come back in the evening to sleep in a pleasant, comfortable room. I would stay there again.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamar, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGood - not perfect\u201d", "Author": "Sualk99", "ReviewID": "UR119684258", "Content": "Hotel 4 Youth am Mauerpark is good alternative if you look for a cheap but good hotel.

On the plus side, the location for sightseeing Prenzlaurberg, its amazing sunday market, the stadium or the north of Mitte is superb. It really is right on the doorstep of the zone, in an area surprisingly lacking in places to stay. BUT It's simply not a hotel. The rooms, while spotless and new, provide the bare minimum, with no TV, kettle, or even cups. Added to this, there are are certain rooms that have doors between them and the next for larger parties, which would be fine if it weren't for the noise from the next room which, assuming it's not a friend of yours, is hugely annoying. AND MOST INFURIATINGLY The staff. I'm sorry, but contrary to other reviewers, we found them to be grumpy, unwilling to acknowledge us at the desk and incapable of fulfilling even the most basic requests. Often they seemed put out to be asked for anything. Maybe it was a bad time for them - but when i asked for a taxi to be booked, they said they would do it, but did not. At night (11pm), i went to ask for two cups of tea to take to our room, and the young man behind the counter said he didn't really want to make us them as he was drinking his own! I jokingly said \"oh sorry, don't worry\", to which he sighed, shrugged his shoulders and proceeded to make the tea (pouring hot water into a cup) like a grumpy teenager. It's not me being tetchy either - the bar/cafe is advertised as 24 hour service, so that's what i expected. And most infuriatingly, we were accused of having breakfast when we did not, and the staff clearly didn't believe us. Now, perhaps some other guest had pretended to be from our room - cheeky - but there was no chance that the staff believed us. They practically demanded we pay 40 Euros (it's 20 per person, steep?) and it was only when we stood our ground that they backed down. Now, all of this might seem like tittle tattle, but the air of the place (at this time) was one of indifference to visitors, and we weren't so much welcomed as 'processed. They didn't say hello, goodbye or even ask how the trip was. This would be fine at the most basic hostel - although i might be doing those a disservice - but not somewhere that charges what are to be fair hotel rates. And calls itself one to boot.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean simple and good location.\u201d", "Author": "tavia14999", "ReviewID": "UR117916265", "Content": "This hotel/hostel is functional and simple but very clean and efficient.

I was pleasantly surprised as although the rooms are a bit spartan, it was very new and modern and comfortable. The location is a little out of the way (and I think actually straddles the old Berlin Wall) - but the Bernauer Strasse tube stop is relatively close and the buses and trams stop right out front. It did get a bit crowded in the breakfast rooms with large groups of kids when I was there - but luckily I guess their chaperones keep an eye on them at night (or they book them on different floors) as at nighttime it was nice and quiet other than a bit of street noise.

Firstly the staff are really helpfull & pleasant & are willing to go out of there way to help. Very clean & bright throughout.There is a small bar on reception so you can take drinks & snacks up to the room if you wish. Rooms are small but clean & fresh and ideal for what we needed for a short break. The only downside was towels are only changed every 4 days. However I am sure if a request was made for a change every 2 days there would not be an issue. Bernauer Strasse U-bahn station is a 5min walk which links straight into Alexanderplatz after 3 stops (5mins). The hotel is also within 5 mins walking distance of a number of restaraunts & around 5-10mins are a number of small but nice bars. Overall we were concerned of the location of this hotel before we arrived but once there you realise there is so much to do in Berlin in all directions its very central!

As the hotel is brand new and well kept, it is spotlessly clean and very warm. Our double room had a bathroom with a bath and a power shower, lots of hot water and big windows. There is a bar but not a bustling atmosphere or anything like that at night, so most nights we took the underground (3 stops from the centre of East Berlin where we spent most of our break) into the centre and taxis were easy to come by at night and cost around 8 euros back to the hotel. However, there is also a great few streets just a 2 minute walk from the hotel which also have some amazing little bars and restaurants. The continental breakfast was great, especially the baskets of freshly baked rolls!
