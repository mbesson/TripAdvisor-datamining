We pre-booked it using an agency and hoped for a good place for our last day. We were quite disappointed. We booked a double room, with private bathroom, TV and AC, but we got ... A TV without any single English speaking channel (though we scanned). The AC was a standing movable one which was more of a fan then AC. The internet didn't work (one of the crew helped us and call to confirm the flight details). We ate lunch in the restaurant, it was a 3 course meal but it was served a bit cold. The quality was ok, but not suitable for an hotel. The breakfast wasn't that good either. The better sides are a helpful and kind crew and a very good location, just a walk away from the main historical zone. All in all, we expected a much better place (and didnt mind paying). The place itself is an old hotel and its standards are low. We wouldn't have stayed there more then a night.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bc", "Title": "\u201cDo not stay there, the worst place we ever stayed in in Mexico\u201d", "Author": "roperanna7", "ReviewID": "UR101263002", "Content": "Rooms looked ok, but closer inspection showed, dirty bedspreads, antique towels, plug ins that did not work., switches missing for lights, No hot water during the day,and sometimes just tepid in the evening.The breakfast was palatable but inconsistent. There was one awesome waiter who did whatever he could for us and it was a pleasure to leave him a big tip.He deserved it after running the restaurant single handed.and providing good service. Rude front desk people in the evening. The location was amazing right in the centro. In otherwords spend a little more and get a nicer place and do not book this place sight unseen like we did. The rooms are listed at 90 dollars a night but we paid 50 and glad we did.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cAwful hotel but in a good location\u201d", "Author": "julie_0301", "ReviewID": "UR45412079", "Content": "The location is great, the rooms are small, with cockroaches and they only have rooms with bathtub. I went with my mother and she had problems going into the shower because of the tub, so I asked for a room without the tub and they said they don\u2019t have! So I asked for a room for disable people and guest what they don\u2019t have as well (isn\u2019t it the law?) The Continental Breakfast is just like the hotel\u2026 awful don\u2019t pay the hotel with it. If you don\u2019t drink cafe or orange juices just like me forget! They don\u2019t have anything else. Also, if you choose for a fruit you don\u2019t get the juice. The toasts are made in a dirty plate so it has a terrible taste!! After the first breakfast there I started going to 7-eleven to buy chocolate and donuts. The staffs, mostly, are nice and willing to help you. I had problems with the morning receptionist but except for her, I didn\u2019t have problems. They claimed to have parking and cable TV. Well they don\u2019t! I needed parking twice and both times I was told it was full.

The waiter asked us tips in Spanish and interrupted our conversation. the waiter didn't speak English and hinder us from asking someone to translate.

We changed rooms, lookin' for one w/ a working a/c, but there were none. The location of it is superb... in front of Alameda park, right on Juarez street, a couple of blocks from Centro Historico. it's close to Reforma, where you can go to Chapultepec park and Museum of Antropolgy. I,ts located next to a Fiesta Inn, a mall and cinema complex.... that made my trip worth thewhile, but don't stay in this hotel looking for comfort...
