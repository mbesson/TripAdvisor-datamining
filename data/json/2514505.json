Maybe the rooms are deliberately bland to make you spend time in the bar ! The bar area was OK, but not somewhere I would be able to relax. Breakfast selection was good, hot food looked OK tho I didn't have any, i just had cereal and toast, the tables weren't very clean, and the dining area had a grubby feel to it.

Iv stayed here before and again was not disapointed. I would not pay the rack rate or above the \u00a360-\u00a370 a night price mainly as you can get better in London for facilities etc but if your wanting a comfortable cheap place to pop your head down then this is perfect. People do complain about having bed linen in rooms and having to make up the spare beds.... Well initially the spare beds are the sofas and also couples book family rooms just for 2 on occassion therefore easier to have the linen available to dress as pleased. Bearing in mind Travelodge is a 'BUDGET ' hotel chain they cut their costs by id imagine sticking to a tight schedule along with no fluff and extras! We never had the linen in our room yet we booked a room for 3 adults. We did check in at 12 as we could on our early check in and the cleaner was on our floor doing other rooms so was easy enough to obtain the linen. We were out all day and into early evening and were back at the hotel for around 9pm. (no clubbing for me as 6 months pregnant lol) The beds were ok but we were on 1st floor at front of hotel. Bit noisy with traffic and people that had enjoyed a few drinks lol.... This did disturb our sleep but to be honest your staying in central london on a weekend so was to be expected. If this will ruin your stay i suggest requesting a quiet room (i have requested a quiet room overlooking what the receptionist said is courtyard area for when i stay again in April with my husband and 4 year old daughter as this may affect her nights sleep) The breakfast is typical Travelodge, and having experienced one last year at the Covent garden Travelodge we did opt to pre book again mainly as on our 1st morning we wanted to be up and out as we had purchased bus tickets on the 'Original tour' and wanted to make the most of our day. Its nothing special and im sure the scrambled egg is made from a powder form but for the bacon, bread, Croisants, yogurts, Muffins & cereals it was more than adequate, coffee tea & juices included as well. theres plenty of places outside the hotel to eat for lunches etc and there is a Tesco express couple doors down which was handy. Theres also places like Garfunkels and frankie & bennys that do 2 for 1 breakfasts/2 for \u00a310 but would have to possibly get tubes or walk a bit further a field for those. The bar is 24hours and food & drinks can be got at all hours. On our 2nd night we had some friends also stay but as they were there for the nightlife we never really saw them. They had a few drinks in the bar and for central london the prices are reasonable. Considering the 24hour bar aspect we were not disturbed in our room and there is security at the reception (its not rowdy or anything, just think they are there for peace of mind) Overall if you were wanting a base and somewhere clean with access to central london it is perfect. I have also stayed at the Covent Garden Travelodge which is exactly the same as this one and just has the edge over moorgate but only for location... We saved about \u00a350 by staying at Moorgate so thats the reason this one won this time (& when i go in April ) Remember you pay budget prices then expect a budget (clean) hotel", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North east england", "Title": "\u201cJust what you need for a shopping trip!\u201d", "Author": "daniellarella13", "ReviewID": "UR124800034", "Content": "Typical travel lodge, basic and plain but very clean.

But the price and importantly the location swung it for myself and two friends going to see Manic Street Preachers at the o2, as we decided to travel there and back by the Thames Clipper boat, which departed from London Bridge, which is just a few stops away on the Northern Line. The hotel was just 5 mins from Old Street underground station, we passed a couple of supermarkets, cafes, pubs and a Subway on the way to the hotel. Not much else around, it\u2019s mainly offices and apartments, but in the grand scheme of things the location of the hotel is in great, as it\u2019s so centrally located on the underground network. We arrived after the 3pm check-in time, there was a small queue at the desk, tried to use the automatic check-in machines, but all three were out of service. Once served check-in was swift. We wanted to eat before heading to the concert, but the restaurant hadn\u2019t started serving at that time, the reception staff, without any prompting from us, went off and kindly checked if the kitchen could do anything for us, they apologised as they couldn\u2019t help us, which was no problem. So I checked that we were okay to dial in a pizza and they were fine with it. In fact, talking of the staff, he check-in staff, bar staff and security guards were all fantastically helpful and lovely, especially the security guards. We had booked a family room, which was at the back of the hotel. It had a double bed and a twin sofa bed, the bed was comfortable the sofa bed a bit too firm and not very comfortable at all. The room also had a bath and a shower en-suite, small flat screen TV, desk , chair, open wardrobe and tea and coffee facilities. There was no hairdryer, but reception lent us a powerful one for a strict 45 mins! Our room was basic, a little bit bare and drab, but to be fair, for the money and location it was perfectly adequate. Also, when I had been looking in to booking a hotel room, some of Travelodge\u2019s rivals had a silly rule that more than two adults were not allowed to share a room, which did not suit us three young women who were spending a girlie weekend in London! So we were happy that we could be accommodated by Travelodge. After the gig, we returned to the hotel at about 1am and made use of the comfortable 24 hour bar and also had a bit of snacky bar food which we had no complaints over. We were pleasantly surprised by the noon check-out the next day, which was great as we were shattered. Check-out was as quick as check-in and the receptionist asked if out stay had been good. So, in summary, the location and price were good, the room basic, yet adequate, the communal facilities were great and the staff excellent.

Not bad for ctrl London on NYE! (Breakfast was \u00a36.95 each and kids eat free, which we added). First off, location, well its easy enough to get to from either Moorgate or Old St tubes on the Northern Line. Its on the busy noisy City Road, so don\u2019t expect peace and tranquillity, at any time 24/7! There are the usual coffee shops around the place, Pret, Nero etc, plus a Metro Sainsbury\u2019s & Tesco within 5mins walk, and a nice looking caf\u00e9 besides Old St tube (which sadly, was closed). On arrival at 2:25, as we had been travelling for 3hrs, and had young kids with us, we asked if we could check in (normal check-in time is 3pm) and was told that would be an extra \u00a310, there is no flexibility with this, which peeved me! and was then told abruptly by the receptionist \"i don\u2019t make the rules\" (zero customer service niceties). When we came back at 2:55 there was now along queue of people waiting to check in, and the foyer was busy; they have self service machines, so we tried this, only it didn\u2019t recognise our booking! So then we waited in line and checked in after a phone call to the house keeper to check if the room was ready. We were in room 254. All TL rooms are basic, so you know in advance what you\u2019re going to get, a bed, TV, bath-shower/WC. All fine & clean. The mattress of the bed was the softest I have ever tried, very uncomfortable, but the sofa bed for 2 kids was fine. The TV didn\u2019t have a remote control, so we went back down to reception and asked for one which was brought up to our room. Most annoying were the noise from adjacent rooms, OK it was NYE so we expected partying, but the constant slamming of door, shouting & screaming from people running up and down the corridors and the loud music was rather testing, even mid-afternoon, early evening! We were out until abt 1:15am, and came back to note the hotel had \u201cSecurity\u201d staff in the foyer, and the bar open 24hrs. We got to sleep at 2-sih, only to be woken up between 4-5am, from returning revellers, no problem, we\u2019d expected that and it soon came down, plus I knew we\u2019d take our revenge when we were getting up at 9 for breakfast, and not trying to be quiet in our room! \uf04a So we eventually went down for breakfast at about 930, to be met by a queue into the restaurant/bar area, which was full of people, we ended up be sat on the sofa /coffee table area as there were no dining tables. What then followed can only be described as a food fight, you would be fortunate to get anything unless waiting in line, with people jostling and barging in front to get at whatever that could grab, not pretty, not relaxed not enjoyable, and food of poor quality and not enough staff to organize the place. Kids managed to get some insipid watery scrambled eggs sausage/beans and toast and we had breads/pastry and juices; it\u2019s a budget hotel, you get what you pay for, don\u2019t expect more.

The room was clean and surprisingly large with a television, kettle/tea/coffee, hangers for clothes... and that's about it! A confusion about the number of people staying in the room (2 of us, though the reservation only was for 1) meant we received an entire set of extra bedding. I'm still not sure why, but it was handy as it meant we had twice the number of pillows and towels. The pillows were quite thin, so the extra set was a bonus. The view from the window was, well, other rooms and the roof of the restaurant. There was little to no noise from outside when the window was closed. The price is room only, and extras such as toiletries (other than a bar of soap), internet access, early check in/out and luggage storage after checkout, which are typically included with the room rate in most hotels, have to be paid for.

I'm just being picky here - but despite this we had a good night's sleep and sound of traffic was very low but if you're not used to the sound of city life you may want some headphones to wear at night in case. We got hungry so went to grab some food at reception, they cook to order even if it's basic you can take it up to the room with you with affordable prices I think it was all night as well (just order at the bar).

The reception area was the biggest and brightest I'd seen, and I've stayed in a few of these Travelodges, they even had complimentary iced water in glasses. The receptionist was very polite and welcoming. Our room was on the fourth floor. I was very pleased to find we had been given a double room with shower and a bath. The room was large with a double bed settee under the window which was great to lounge on. The actual bed was very comfortable too. We had the buffet breakfast in the morning, excellent value, and a very spacious modern dining area. Lots of choices of food. The waitress who seated us was very pleasant as well. The only negative thing I can say, and I'd have to be forced at gun point to think of anything, is that the hotel was quite warm, especially in corridors by the lift, but again, how much time do you actually spend there? The traffic outside was quite noisey with the window open, but not too bad in the early hours while you are sleeping obviously. Also the location isn't that good because there's not much going on in the immediate area, but its only 5 mins walk to Old St tube, or you could walk to town as I did in The evening back to the hotel, took me half an hour.

This was done in a very rude manner, and the first time they knocked they claimed they were \"checking the windows\". So honesty is also not this hotels strongest point. Check-in was a slow process due to the systems being down, which led to queues of people on the street outside until 5pm each day.

I should have been suspicious really though, given that it was a fairly last minute booking and still had some availability. I have rarely known London hotels to be so busy - only hostels or very high price rooms available anywhere in zone 1! I booked online and price wasn't cheap at \u00a3149 for one person and breakfast extra. I arrived early but check in can' be performed even a minute early as apparently they need to wait for 'their systems to change over'? - what is all that about? Viewed this with suspicion, as was invited to pay more to get in room 40 mins early! Didn't bother and was offered to sit in the bar area and someone would be with me to get me a drink. Almost an hour later, nobody had turned up and I wasn't that bothered really, as by then the room (same as used for all meals taken in hotel) had filled up with people (big student parties it seemed) and luggage, was extremely hot and tables were so sticky that any papers I was trying to read had stuck to them. I decided to return to the foyer and get into the queue that was forming there and I favoured the human check in choice over the machines. By 5 mins past 3 o'clock that part had been completed relatively smoothly and I was quite impressed to be told I had a room on the 1st floor. Even more impressive to find it was close to the lift. That is where being impressed left me! The hotel (and rooms it seems) are a strange shape due to age and previous use of building. It is also unbearably hot in places and no air con. I must have booked one of their last available rooms as it was a disabled room, although I did not have those requirements. The corridor was such a tight turn from the lift though that a wheelchair user would surely struggle to get to the room door. The room overlooked the back of the hotel and so didn't suffer with noise thankfully, as having the only window open a crack (all that is possible) was essential. The window was tiny and if I left the blind up then every other room overlooking this back triangle could see down and into my room. The only view was other postage stamp windows and the odd dirty tissue somebody had lobbed out onto the roof space - not pleasant! The blind was just a plain, grubby cream colour. By contrast to many posts on here, the room itself was vast! It would probably taken around 10 mobility scooters and needed them too! In all of that space stood a solitary, very plain and minimal bed. Just a pillow and white duvet and no colour at all (although the bedding did appear clean). The only other 'furniture' in the whole room was one plastic chair and something resembling a plank for a desk and a small, open hanging space joined to the end. The whole room looked as though someone had moved all the furniture out and then just put a bed back. I coughed and nearly scared myself, as the noise echoed around the space. Although the bed seemed clean, sadly the carpet wasn't and I kept my shoes right by the bed! The TV (stood on the 'shelf') was very basic and no menu facility for programmes. It was all a bit 'old'. The worst was still to cocme though, with the bathroom! Being a disabled room, it was a walk-in wet room. That wouldn't present me with problems - had it been clean! The whole room and shower / toilet area looked as though the floors were dirty - probably from wheelchairs? Not sure, but the floor surface in the shower / toilet area was damaged and had dirty marks and black areas in the cracks and joins. Worse still, at low level the tiles and floor edges were orange with scum and there was no way I was going in there with bare feet. I see cleaner showers on basic camp sites! The shower curtains also had some strange red marks, which could have been scum but looked like dried blood. Good job I was only there one night as the shower didn't appeal! The whole thing was like an 'unpadded cell' and with room for more prisoners beds to be moved in! Breakfast was interesting, as I was already expecting the sticky tables (and not disappointed!). The tables are wiped, but the varnish appears to have given up and is permanently sticky, so surely can't be cleaned hygenically. Even the salt pots are stuck to the tables and it certainly stops you eating with elbows on the table! The food itself wasn't too bad, as they can't go far wrong with cereals and yoghurts that are packaged and there is enough to pick from to get by without having to eat anything prepared by the hotel, if you are by now suspicious of hygiene. The staff were courteous enough as well, although the minute you get up to fetch something else from the self-service buffet, your table is completely cleared. That necessitated starting all over again and fetching another drink etc,, as there was no way I was leaving my handbag on the chair to show the table was in use, given the traffic through the dining area. I had thought a nearly full cup of copy would mean the place might be left for a few minutes, but by the time I had collected a croissant and jam everything had been removed! If I had paid anything under \u00a3100, then I might have expected these standards. However, at \u00a3149 plus \u00a36.95 for breakfast, I expected something better. Premier Inns and Holiday Inn Express have always been good, basic accommodation and something along the lines I was expecting. This 'hotel' is far inferior. The member of staff on reception did ask if my stay had been comfortable as I handed in my room key card. I replied that the room had been disappointing and her response was that the building was very old and meant that room shapes were unusual. Obviously this must also make cleaning a challenge too?!! About time they reinvested some of the money they charge you in refreshing, repairing and generally maintaining I think.

What I got was one of the more bizarre hotel experiences I've ever had, which really didn't befit something in the city center of London. First, the good things: - The location is pretty optimal. 2 minutes to the Old Street tube, 5 minutes' walk to Moorgate and the north side of the City of London. There is lots of nightlife in the area, but if you're on a high floor you can't really hear anything. - This is probably the least expensive hotel which meets basic standards and is very convenient to the city center. We paid an average of \u00a3112/night after VAT. - There was free wifi available in the lobby, although it was very slow and inconsistent. Wifi in the rooms cost money, I think \u00a37/day. I went to - Breakfast is decent, the eggs and muffins were good, was not the lap of luxury but I've seen worse. Hot tip: They don't check whether you've paid for breakfast, just whether you're staying in the hotel, so you can bogart a free breakfast if hunger or poverty have overwhelmed your ethics. - There's a bar in the breakfast room, it's fairly well-stocked, and they serve a (very small) menu of food all night. - The rooms were clean. No cleanliness complaints, despite what I'm about to say... Now, the negative. When I say Spartan, I mean it. No expense that could be spared was made, if that makes sense. The room had: - No phone - No clock on the wall or on the nightstand (no alarm clock either) - No extra toilet paper rolls (had to ask the cleaning lady) - No A/C - No hair dryer - No decorations or art of any kind - just bare walls, it was \"mental asylum chic\" decor - No comforter on the bed. Hope a sheet is enough! In addition: - The bathroom lights were inconsistent and behaved oddly. No light in the shower. - The blinds were really noisy and clattered around - we actually stoppered them with tissues, because otherwise we would've had to close the window, which we couldn't do with no A/C... - Flimsy pillows, no substance to them. Used my travel neck pillow instead. - Haunted elevators. I'm only half-kidding. Buttons would randomly press themselves, the elevators would randomly skip your floor, or stop on other floors that weren't pressed, or reset the whole floor queue. Some buttons refused to operate without a lot of coaxing. Clearly, Travelodge was not interested in paying for an elevator repairman (much less an exorcist). - Poor customer service. Staff would stand around ignoring people, would tell everyone to use the nearby kiosks, and when asked for a simple, routine thing - \"could I please have a copy of my check-out receipt\", we were told that they can't do such things, that we got a copy electronically over email and should use that. Nevermind that the point of a check-out bill is to make sure you're not being falsely charged for incidentals! So, overall while the hotel met basic needs, it did so in as poor a fashion as possible.

On arrival we had to wait for check in as we had arrived too early, no problem this gave us a chance to check out the facilities. An ample bar and a good sized restraunt area with televisions and 4 PC's for internet use. So first impressions were fairly good on what we had seen so far. After a pleasant check-in from one of the employees we proceeded though the door to the lift area. THIS is where the proverbial hit the fan (well it would have done if we had had one). The lift foyers were unbearable and oppressively hot and smelly, the corridors are not that much better, thankfully we were only on the second floor and used the stairs a lot but even then a sat nav would have been useful to find them. The room was AWFUL, it was extremely tight and narrow and was far from being a family room, I would struggle to describe it as a double actually. The window is set out quite high looking out on to a disused building opposite which served to add to the feeling of quite \"prison like\". The bed was extremely soft and uncomfortable and you slid into the middle all the time and with no air conditioning became exceedingly hot at night which gave us sleepless nights along with the expected noise. The bathroom faired even worse, the air extractor didnt work which left you feeling rather faint by the time you had finished your shower and made the bathroom smell of damp continually, the soap was never replenished(had to complain before I got any more) paint was peeling off the walls and generally the cleanliness was of a poor standard. We did not eat very much in the restaraunt as the food was of the usual frozen chuck it in the deep fat fryer range served on tables that were very sticky. The location of this hotel is ok and has plenty of shops etc close by. There are are 2 tube stations within 5 minutes walk and service is generally very good, however to get to the centre of London you do need to change tubes and if you dont have any savvy about you could become quite confusing.

We were in over the weekend of 30 June-3 July, so experienced one workday night, Friday and Saturday nights, and Sunday night. Sunday was the only night when the noise level from outside the room was what I'd call \"low\". Saturday night was disturbing, with a loud party outside and all the noise reverberating around the buildings, and it went on through the wee hours. The other two nights were tolerable. My advice is to bring ear plugs, just in case. The room itself, on floor 1 facing Tabernacle St was spartan and very clean, with a teapot and coffee/tea, sugar etc for the morning brew. One small bar of soap was provided in the bath. Towels are of excellent quality, very large and absorbent. Pillows are small, and the basic mattress was covered with a base sheet and a very nice comforter. We requested bedding for the sofa bed and received it promptly. Hot water was in plentiful supply. Despite the noise we experienced I still give this hotel a good rating because of the positive room attributes and its location relative to many places of interest, good transport by numerous bus routes and Moorgate and Old Street underground stations a short walk, and proximity to Spitalfields. If the hotel restaurant doesn't suit you there are many choices within a short walking distance. Over the weekend the neighborhood slows down (except for nightlife). Customer service was helpful in sorting out a reservation change using the telephone once we got through to the right person; my opinion of the website and first point of contact for customer service is that there's room for improvement.

The hotel is located 10 mins from Old Street Tube Station so you only need a zone 1 & 2 travelcard (\u00a36.60 each) to whizz around the city all day. It's a couple of stops from Euston station. They charge you an extra \u00a310 to check in before 3pm and there is no left luggage facility so I recommend timing your journey not to get there too early. There are easy to use, self check in machines in reception if there is a queue. There are plenty local places to eat and drink, a Tesco Metro and small Sainsbury's within a few minutes walk. There are pubs and cafe's also. I would however recommend eating in the city during the evening as we didn't find anywhere to eat after the cafes closed at approx 6pm. There is a bus stop right outside that will take you to London Bridge. The hotel itself has a late night bar and serves food until approx 10pm, they show TV in the bar area. If you are looking for late night food, the hotel advertises room service throughout the night but when we asked they said there was no food available??? That was our only complaint for the duration of our stay as the hotel was perfect for us. You know what you're going to get with a Travelodge, nothing fancy but clean and tidy. As we didn't spend much time at the hotel and it was in such a great location we found it ideal. We asked for extra pillows and got these no problem and we weren't disturbed by noise at all despite there being a few large coach parties staying at the same time as us.

Our room was a double on the first floor with a window opening onto an internal view of the hotel. No Traffic noise. No corridor noise. No lift noise.

The price for a double room was surprisingly high - similar to other London hotels, despite it being a \"cheap\" Travelodge - although it's fairly central so that might be why. The automatic sliding doors at the front of the hotel have \"Welcome\" printed on them, so it's a bit of a surprise to everyone that they do precisely nothing when you approach them from the outside. Security is understandable in London, but while waiting in the lobby saw dozens of people nearly bumping into the doors because of the mixed message of the signs. Even for a budget hotel the rooms are incredibly sparse, without phone or indeed TV remote control. One of the three lifts was out of order when we were there, and the corridors were piercingly white and spare, like a conference centre. Our room was functional, but that was it. Compared to similar hotels it felt like someone had gone in before us and removed anything that might make it feel relaxing. The walls were white and bare (except where they'd been scuffed), the furniture all rock-hard pine/MDF, we're still not sure our heater worked, there was no bath mat, the bathroom was a bit damp-towel smelly (although spotlessly clean) and the single chair was one of those stackable plastic ones. If you tripped anywhere in the room you'd land on either a sharp corner or the bed. None of the hen or stag do's we saw milling in the foyer actually kept us awake in the end, but around 3.30am we were subjected to ten minutes of incredibly loud drum & bass that shook the windows. It's still not clear where from: maybe a nearby club was doing some grand finale, or maybe it was just a renegade taxi. The hotel was sharply understaffed, although what staff we saw were polite; frequently queues would develop at the front desk when the only person staffing it was required elsewhere. Checking out was a complete mystery - the desk was deserted when we did so - and we think we were right in just discarding our keycard in a slot provided. Who knows? Maybe even now they're wondering where we got to. All in all, it was a place to lay our heads, and there was no real deal breaker - and you could probably do worse in central London - but in future we'd go for somewhere a little further out, as the overwhelming sparseness and shoestringness (even compared to Travelodges and Premier Inns elsewhere) didn't really add to the enjoyment of our stay.", "Date": "January 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBasic, but does the job\u201d", "Author": "RS10675", "ReviewID": "UR92908452", "Content": "I've stayed at this Travelodge a few times.

For a hotel in London, where most people are likely to only be in their hotel in the morning and night, a travelodge is ideal, but there were a few problems with the service in this hotel that resulted in me only rewarding it 3 stars. FIrst, check in was a joke. We arrived after a long train journey at 2:30pm and were told by the single receptionist that check in was at 3pm - a mere 30 minutes away. Instead of simply allowing us to check in at that time, she very abruptly told us that we have to either pay a \u00a310 charge to check in early or wait until 3pm. Needless to say we did the latter and sat around in the reception area like idiots, along with the many other guests, while we waited for the elusive 3 O clock hour. When check in finally did open, the queue extended out of the hotel and onto the street. When we did eventually get to the front desk, the attendant simply checked our name and told us to use one of the 3 electronic check in machines adjacent to the front desk. However, these didn't work very well at all and after about another half hour, we finally got our key and went up to our room. The room was perfect - for the very cheap price there is a double bed, sofa bed (just enough for 2 adults and 2 teens, although as one of the teens myself, I felt the sofa bed I slept in was too short for my legs) a TV, bath, kettle and toilet and sink. Wi-Fi is available but there is a charge to use it on portable devices. Computers are available downstairs though which charge \u00a31 for 20 minutes of internet access. We actually ate our evening meal in the hotel later on, as the menu looked rather nice and good value for money. However, after sitting down and choosing our meals from the menu, we were given a list by the foreign bar tender/waiter that contained all the dishes that were not available - this included about half the items on the menu. My mum had to have her 4th choice of main course after all her other choices were not available. The lame excuse given for this lack of items was that the menu was changing tomorrow - absolute rubbish. When the starters came, they were very nice and it was a shame they had to be preceded by poor service and a rude waiter. However, upon receiving the mains, one of the dishes was wrong. Now I know English is not an easy language to learn, but the phrase \"Fish and chips\" should not be confused with \"Chicken burger\" - this is what our waiter managed to do though when he took our orders though. Although my mum settled for the burger, the waiter insisted he take it back to the kitchen and replace it with fish and chips for her, but not until she had eaten a few of the chips on the plate. This bit was disgusting - the waiter, in plain view of us (although he didn't know we could see him) shoved the chicken burger and chips onto another plate with his bare hands and took it straight out to another customer - presumably the one who had actually ordered the burger. Very poor hygiene by this waiter - I'm not sure this even happens in Syria, or wherever this idiot came from. Then we came to order desserts and, you've guessed it, the service was atrocious again. We were given yet another list of items not available and it was my sister this time who and to accept her 4th choice of food. The shocking thing about ordering the desserts though was the attitude of the bar tender with whom orders were placed - we asked for ice cream, bread and butter pudding and cookie ice cream cake and his response was, and I quote, \"We have no ice cream - you can have some apple crumble\" in a very rude and fairly loud tone. I wouldn't have been surprised to hear him mutter something even ruder under his breath. But again, when the food finally did come, it was terrific. The service really let our meal down though. We all had a relaxing nights sleep in our clean, warm and comfortable room and the next morning, we went down for breakfast. This has become something of a clich\u00e9 in this review, but THE SERVICE WAS POOR YET AGAIN. We were shown to a table by probably the most friendly staff member in the hotel - she actually said good morning and had a smile on her face, but the poor service started where it had left off the night before. There were no mugs and no coffee in the machine. When we told a staff member about this, her response was a very rude and loud, I quote again \"Yes yes I get them in a moment!\" The breakfast itself though was delicious. Full cooked english and plenty of bread, cereal, yoghurt and croissants etc. for the continental. It does cost \u00a37.50 for each person but this isn't too bad considering you can have as much as you want (I also sneaked out a few bits for our day in London hehe!) For the sake of a conclusion, I will split the hotel into 2 parts - 2 parts that could be used to review most hotels. Content and Service. In other words, what you get and how it is presented to you as guests. In terms of content, you can't go wrong with this hotel - rooms are very clean and convenient, food is fantastic and it is magnificent value if you're wanting a base for your stay in London - central location as well, just down the road from Old Street tube station. In terms of service, however, this hotel has a lot to learn. Almost all staff members were very rude and abrupt in their communications with the guests and the admin staff seriously need to review how to stock a hotel of this size with enough food for breakfast and evening meals. In summary, it's a pain to get the things you need (long check in, very little food etc.) but once it all arrives, it's of a positive standard.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch", "Title": "\u201cFantastic base when visiting the sights!!\u201d", "Author": "tj31", "ReviewID": "UR84655375", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel a few times now and on both occasions it has been great staying here.

We were on the first floor looking out on City Road (so coudn't really have been any closer to street traffic unless we pitched a tent on the pavement) and I can honestly say that that the noise did not bother us one bit and we slept soundly both nights. Yes you can hear the traffic, and I heard a cheeky little ambulance siren at 11pm one night, but hello, you're in the centre of London. One thing I found odd was that on a Sunday, everything near the hotel is closed - even Marks and Spencer and local restaurants.

We stayed in room 117 which is right at the end of the corridoor so you dont get people walking by making a noise. The problem we thought were: 1. Rooms on front (as most people say on here) ARE noisy, but this is the city of London so if you are happy sleeping through deliveries at 0500hrs you'll be ok!, the road is VERY busy and traffic passes through at all hours so dont expect a quiet lane which has the occasional car. Ask for a room on the rear if you are a light sleeper. 2. There was only 1 X Bath towel and 1 X Hand towel issued? Why for a double room? 3. The room smelt of damp which presumabley came from the bathroom although the bathroom itself didnt smell. 4. My partner said his pillows smelt of cat pee!? However the laundry did appear to be clean. 5. No parking facilites and nearest NCP charges \u00a336 for 24hrs 6. No Hair dryers in room (girls take your own) 7. No phones in room so if you want to have a rant you cant. On a positive note the room had a basic standard of cleanliness, the shower was very nice when the water eventually warmed up. My other half said the room was cold but the heater soon warmed it up and I wasnt cold in there. The foyer is ok with an express check in facility so that was pretty straight forward, there is a cafe/bar for you on site with vending machines in the foyer. The location is good, near to theatres (taxi distance) and there are a few pubs nearby.

My friends and I had booked this hotel in advance last July for a concert. We had planned in advance to check in early as we were getting the over night bus from Glasgow so we paid the \u00a310 early check in fee when we booked. We had booked a saver family room for the three of us. Check in - After arriving into London at 7am we did a few tourist things til we were able to check, We got to the hotel at 1145 we thought we would chance our luck incase they would let us check in a wee bit earlier but the very RUDE girl on reception said we have to wait til early check in which starts at 1200. We told her we'd wait in the bar which we did and had a few drinks which were seriously over priced. At 12 we went back to reception and the rude girl told us there were no family rooms ready and it would be another 20mins before they would have one for us. So went back to the bar for another over priced round. There was a family at the table next to us and they were boasting to another family who had just came in that they had arrived at 1045 and were told if they had paid \u00a310 there and then they could check in and get a room, so the 2nd family went to reception and within minutes returned with the key to a family room. As we had been told we werent allowed to check in before 12 and then told that there were no rooms ready for us at 1200 we weren't exactly happy. At reception there was now a rude man aswell as the rude woman who said she thought we had left. 1310 we got our room. Our second night stay was booked under my friends name so we asked if we could just keep the same room and the man said that it was fine but when we came down for breakfast the next morning the new man on reception was a bit hostile towards us. he had no change and asked us to get the correct change before we could eat, we asked could we not bring it down after breakfast and he said no we're not allowed because we are checking out. We then told him we weren't and that we had the 2nd booking that the rude man from the day before had okayed us for keeping the same room, we also told him of the problems from the day before. After we went back to our room to find change to pay for breakfast the man on reception told us that we have to give our credit card details, I told him that my details were already on their system. This was another trip back to the room before breakfast. We told him that were weren't happy about the way the staff had treated us, we were not offered any refund on our early check in fee nor an apology. when we finally got to breakfast - not a lot of selection but it is a travelodge so didnt expect much but no clean cups or cutlery and lots of dirty dishes left by the food which i found a little un hygenic. The room itself was ok very basic, but walls are paper thin can hear everything thats going on outside. Location was a 2 minute walk from Moorgate tube station so handy for getting around central London.

I rang the hotel prior to us staying there as I wanted to confirm the price of the NCP Car park situated just next to it as all the other travelodges we have stayed in in London offer very good rates for parking as you are a guest. So the lady confirmed \u00a315.80 for 24 hours which was fine, as if you aren't a guest the cost is \u00a336.00 which is obviously alot more. When we arrived and checked in we asked again to just make sure that the cost was correct that we had previously been told (otherwise I would have moved the car to another car park abit futher away). The lady checked a folder under the desked and said yes its \u00a315.80. We went upto our room which was very basic, suprising as for example the Docklands Travelodge was soo much nicer. It was like staying in a uni dormatory not just by the facilities of the bedroom but having a very drunk lady bang on our door continuously then realising she'd got the wrong room. As the corridors were quite narrow every door that shut you could here easily so we didn't sleep very well either, we would have rung downstairs but there was no phone in the room...strange we thought. We spent the following day in London then went back to the car to pay and of course the machine told us \u00a336.00 so we went back to the travelodge to ask for some help with this problem as obviously expecting it to be the cheaper rate. The manager eventually came and saw us, he was sooo shockingly rude and unhelpful. When we explained the situation he said \"no its not so what do you want me to about it? Its not my problem!\" We explained that we confirmed the price of the parking twice and have always had discount with parking with every other travelodge we have stayed in and he denied this too!! (I think we would know) We informed him of this folder that was taken out to look at by the receptionist and he said theres not such folder, when the employee next to him had it in his hands! So I pointed at it and he said \"ohh thats 2 years old\" soo why would it still be in the reception area for the wrong information to be given out if its 2 years old?! we also added why hasn't it been updated if this is wrong information. He then said the new one is out the back....The girl who told you this rate will have to reimburse you I will have to give you her number. (helpful don't you think?) So he was happy to blame his staff AND give us her personal mobile number!! We asked if we could have a photo copy of the page containing the wrong information so we could follow it up with head office and he refused. So we took his name and asked for the head office telephone number and he said there isn't one!!! YES there is! as you can see where this is going....He was awful, so unhelpful, rude, ignorant...so many people don't have jobs right now and HE is a manager in London. Scary and sad thought... Fortunately there was a whole queue of customers checking in just next to us at the reception so they saw and heard everything...Word of Mouth can be the worst : ) I wished them all luck as we left...If we had to stay at any of the Travelodges we've been to again we'd go the Docklands, its brand new and parking is just \u00a35 for 24 hours, most deffinately!! : )", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "BIRMINGHAM", "Title": "\u201cCOLD\u201d", "Author": "BirminghamThomas", "ReviewID": "UR53219207", "Content": "The reception area was clean and tidy and the ppl were very friendly and even moved me to a higher floor when asked at check in, but..

Thirdly, they wont leave another toilet roll if there is more than a quater of a roll left which is absolutely ridiculous...we had to return to reception on 2 occasions to ask for another one which is something that should never happen when a room is cleaned daily (which these are) - it is incredibly frustrating having to make lots of stops at reception on your way in and out of the hotel.

Hotel - large, clean, modern, no problems with staff, breakfast, food, bar service and vending machines on all floors. 3 lifts but no left luggage due to security in city location. payable early check in/late check out available. family rooms usually 1st/2nd floor with double bed plus 1 single with extra lower pull out for 4th bed. shower & bath but no toiletries or hairdryer. tv and tea/coffee making facilities in room. Fans available as no air con. Location - set in the heart of the financial city with a bus stop right at the front door and 2 tube stops at each end of the street - moorgate and old street. 5 mins walk to both. Personally prefer moorgate - area not as quiet at night. 10/15min walk from Liverpool St station. Road in front of hotel noisy with traffic and nearby clubs at night but pretty good sound proofing and you are in the centre of london! Mainly office environment but some bars, restaurants, shops and a subway takeaway on same street. Ideally tesco express next door and M&S 2 min away. However very quiet area at weekends most shops/bars late opening or closed. Value - room rates vary from fantastic sale rate of \u00a39.99 to approx \u00a3150 per night. Not worth \u00a3150 but can get amazing bargains. We paid approx \u00a3120 4 nights family of 4!! This is our 2nd stay here after being recommended by a friend and will definately stay again. If like us you plan to spend all day exploring this fab city and will basically just use your hotel to sleep, this is a fab clean, great value choice with excellant transport links. Tip: I would always chose to stay slightly further away from some of the busier areas say the west end where a lot of the hotels are but which is alway noisy and frantic. As long as you are near a bus stop and tube station everything is within 5-10 min tube ride.", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cNot built for summer\u201d", "Author": "EasyOzzie", "ReviewID": "UR36995462", "Content": "Ok, so we stayed there over the hottest week in 6 years but didn't ease the lack of air conditioning or a window that could be opened more than 4 inches.

It was appalling. I am actually a fan of Travelodge Hotels in general & have stayed in many of them. To start with, it took us 30 mins to check in, im not sure why as there was only 2 people in front of us. The room was sweltering. The heat could only be relieved by opening a window onto, yes you guessed it, City Road, one of the busiest road in london. Along side that, the hotel is situated beside a strip club in which all sorts of questionable & boisterous characters make there way in & out of all hours of the night. It was funny listening to their conversations the 1st night, the 2nd night, the novelty had worn off along with patience after the police had to be called to sort out a row at 3am. They wouldn't/couldn't change our room although we pleaded with them. The blind fell off the wall the 2nd night so along side heat & noise, we had to endure light. They have vending machines in the foyer for drinks/snacks/toiletries which on both nights would not provide any guest with change to use them which almost caused a riot as people were thirsty. & as for the infamous coffee shop, dont believe them, a member of staff told me the coffee machine never worked!

There is a pub and a club located in the same alley as the back side of the hotel. In addition to that, people who work in the buildings near by come out for smoke breaks and have loud conversations. The conversations, the pub noise, and the club noise all carry very well up into the rooms and pretty much drowns everything out if your window is open. We initially had a corner room, at the back of the hotel, located at the far end of the hotel from the club, but still on the first floor. As long as my earplugs were in and the window was closed I was able to sleep. This was a little uncomfortable though, because the rooms can get very warm and there is no air conditioning. The only other complaint than the noise I have, would be with the staff. After a couple of days of staying in the same room, we noticed that the carpet was very wet near the bathroom. Evidently we had a leak. We let the front desk know and they were unconcerned, but totally willing to let us have a new room. That was great, until we checked into our new room and the TV was broken. Ok, no big deal, this is a large hotel, we can just ask for another room. We went downstairs, but encountered a new staff person at the front desk. We explained the situation and were told we could not change rooms because the TV didn't work. Well, that might be the case, but I would think if you were flooded out of your other room, the staff might want to make sure you're comfortable in your new one? There was no arguing with this staff member, but luckily the first one that helped us came along and they allowed us to switch again. Now, this third room didn't have a remote, but luckily we still had our key from the last room, and were able to zip down and swipe the remote. So we settled in, three stories higher than we were before, and although the room was much smaller than the corner room we had before, we were delighted to discover the noise had diminished a bit. We were now able to watch TV with the window open, even if we still couldn't sleep with it open. This is a kinda lengthy review to say, \"if you get this place on a great price online, aren't going to spend much time here, and own a pair of earplugs, this is a clean, fairly well located hotel.\" Also, I wanted to share that we booked every night individually to get a better price, and had no problems with this. The front desk said we could stay in the same room the entire time (they didn't foresee the flood). The only slight inconvenience was checking our key in every morning on our way out, just in case... and setting us up in the same room again.

The website at the time of booking advised of the nightclub noise, which I will admit we heard none of, but failed to mention that it is on a major bus route (it now does mention this on the new website). The \"double glazing\" was awful, and after conducting a test, I can assure you that there was no noticeable difference in noise between the window being open and closed! Pretty poor for someone on such a main road, even if it is a budget hotel. The second disappointment was the attitude of one particular member of staff. I would like to start here by saying that all subsequent members of staff we dealt with were polite and courteous, however, the first impression we got was awful. We tried to check in early, but having not booked this, were were not surprised when there was nothing available. However, the attitude of the staff member was disgraceful - she basically told us to get out of the hotel and not come back until 3. When i asked if I could leave my luggage, I was told in no uncertain terms that I couldn't. Although i was annoyed at this, I understand it is Travelodge policy, but i did not need to be told this so rudely. The hotel was cheap, so I suppose in one way i shouldnt complain, but neither me nor my girlfriend got much sleep in 3 nights due to the traffic noise.

When I came back the room was still very warm, but thought I will at least get some air in the room, by leaving the window open.

We were on the sixth floor facing City Road and were not bothered by any street noise. I had emailed in advance and requested a room in a quiet section of the hotel. The bath/shower was excellent with good water pressure. The only plumbing problem was that the loo needed to \"rest\" and couldn't be flushed two consecutive times. We did not try the breakfast buffet but did have coffee and muffins at the attached Coffee Republic and at EAT right next door. We had a few \"in room picnics\" with take away we got at the M&S two blocks away or from Liverpool station which was about a 10 minute walk. The bus service is great with a stop right outside the door for busses headed to Liverpool Station or toward St. Paul's. The northern bus stop is across the street and about a block north where you can catch busses to King's Cross or the #205 goes all the way to Paddington Station. While not in the most preferable area of London, I would stay again for the bargain rate we received. If you are looking for a clean hotel and can get the discounted rate, don't hesitate to book at the Travelodge City Road.", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbernauld, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cgood value for money\u201d", "Author": "sandisam", "ReviewID": "UR15826342", "Content": "booked on i.net for \u00a359, cheap for central london. didnt expect much.

I must say the staff at reception were wonderful, and managed to keep us in the same room for the whole 5 days. The hotel itself is located between Old Street and Moorgate tube stations. We mostly used Moorgate because it was on the Circle Line as well as Northern Line, whereas Old Street is only on the Northern Line. There is also a bus stop right outside the hotel\u2019s front door. The room was sparsely furnished, but immaculately clean. Being an ambulant room, there was plenty of space and we were on the top (7th) floor facing away from City Road. Had absolutely no problems with any noise and the view was quite good.

While it is not in the most exciting part of London, it is relatively quiet at night which is nice after a looong flight from California! I recommend taking the Northern Line to Old Street rather than Moorgate personally. It's only a few blocks away from Old Street tube station (head toward the churchyard, which I think would be south). Check in is at THREE pm, however. I seem to recall when I booked that it was at TWO pm, which meant a lot of people were just sitting around waiting for 3pm, and then a queue formed to check in. That was rather annoying. But... for the early booker rate of 29 pounds, I didn't mind waiting an hour. The first room I had was a family room, so there was a pull out sofa bed for my friend and a double bed for me. I slept just fine in the double, and my friend never pulled out the bed because she said the sofa was perfect the way it was! The bathroom was fine, perfectly clean, and the shower water temperature and pressure were excellent! The second night at the end of the trip (I went to Paris) I had a double, and as soon as I got to my room, a fire alarm (test) went off, and we gathered outside for 10 minutes until we were allowed back in. Sort of annoying but at least it wasn't raining out. The room was of equal cleanliness and quality as the first. The flat screen TV was nice, and the bathroom was very clean.

Spotless bathroom, clean white duvets, comfiest pillows I've had at a hotel. For 26 pounds we had a bargain. There is some bar noise at night especially if you have a window open, so bring earplugs, but overall the outside noise was minimal. Rooms are small but adequate. One problem: no phones in the room, even for use in emergency. This is a problem. What would happen in case of fire, heart attack, etc?? Not only could we not call, they could not contact us in case of a call from family, etc. Unfortunately, there were high school/college groups who caused trouble 2 nights running, and although front desk apologized, they really didn't do much. I was so ticked off (it was 2 am and they were still noisy) I ended up dressing and going out and telling the noisy group off. Guests should not have to be security guards. One tip for those of us from N. America. I ran into people who said their radiator was broken, but it wasn't, it's just different from ours. You have to turn the switch on at the plug. Then look at the top right of the rad and you'll see a min-max dial and a small beige bar. Press the bar so that the red light comes on, then it's turned on. I think they could post instructions over it for international guests, I noticed others in previous reviews noting \"broken\" rads. We ate at the restaurant once, the barman Ryan was fabulous, very nice, but the food was dreck. I ordered what I thought was a baked potato with sliced chicken and got pink creamed chicken instead. Disgusting. I thought that was outlawed now. Transit is fabulous, buses stop right out front, and buses 271 or 214 will take you right into Liverpool station in 5 minutes where you can get a variety of buses and Tube on 3 different lines, stores, etc. Moorgate is also just 2 stops away and any bus leaving Moorgate will stop across from the hotel. Moorgate/Liverpool is nicer than Old Street area. EAT is right next door, M&S 5 minutes away, Liverpool station has a good variety of shopping, Boots, Carphonewarehouse, Simply Food, etc. Very safe area. I walked alone at night from Liverpool station over to City Road, all around the area at night, never had a problem.
