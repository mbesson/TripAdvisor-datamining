We waited in a queue for 10 mins to check-in and at no time did anyone offer us water, juice, flannels etc. After we had finished checking in... I then had to ask...where are the lifts?, what time is breakfast?, what time is check-out? There were then no porters to take our bags up to our rooms. As I say I dont want to sound like a 'drama queen' and I am used to staying in hostels etc....... but when you pay 5* prices in a 5* Hotel you expect a standard of service....and we didnt receive that standard of service. The rooms itself was supurb, very large & clean with a great view of the creek, and there was a floor to ceiling window which slid open.... an excellent novelty, as most hotel rooms in Europe dont have windows that open.

I will be going back soon and I would definitely pick this hotel again for the sake of its location, though I know I am compromising on some of the glitzier opportunities available in town. The entrance is pretty grand but smells a bit musty. Overall impression here is good though, and all the restaurant/dining options are off this main hall. Check-in lacked charm but was entirely efficient (and they let me check in at 7 am so really can't complain at them at all on this point. What a relief!) Room - my room faced the road but was on a high floor as requested. I got a club room in fact. The room was nothing amazing but functional and comfortable - just a little bit dated. They did put me in a room right behind a lift shaft (my pet hate) but ear plugs did the trick. Or maybe it was just that I was so tired from flight/aircon/work etc! Bathroom rather dated and the fixed shower head is another pet hate. Rubbish for hair washing (girls will understand). Anyhow, everything worked and they had a couple of decent tv channels. Only slight complaint was that it was a bit cold! I called down for a robe and that took nearly 36 hours and 3 requests to materialise. They have since emailed me to apologise about this so I can honestly say that they take complaints seriously. Club lounge was a nice touch - I expected it to be more basic than it actually is (based on other reviews) - but service was friendly and really you can't underestimate the convenience of being able to pop in for a quick beer/snack on the way back up to your room after a long day in somebody elses office! Plenty of space. Could possibly do with a slightly darker/homier corner for relaxing - it is a bit airport lounge - but still, not bad. Also they will bring up coffee to your room if you order it the night before (not charged as room service). I thought that was a very nice touch. Though my room rate included breakfast I still chose to get my coffee here every morning - a fair selection of breakfast food and no wait whatsoever whereas the restaurant would have taken much longer to get seated/served I am sure. Food. I visited the pub once. It was very smoky and the football was very loud. Still I did get to see Thierry Henry score for Arsenal which was a sight I never thought I would see again. I ate every evening in the Italian restaurant. It was a bit cold for the terrace (and people smoke out there) but the view over the creek and skyline is very nice. You have to make the most of this as you aren't in town to see it all close up. Service was really sweet and attentive. Food was very good. I didn't visit the Indian or the Asian (which was a buffet on the night I did decide to try it). Gym. Good. 3 treadmills but only 2 in working order. 2 bikes. Quite a few weight machines and free weights. Only thing is that it is so humid in there. It is next to the saunas so that probably explains it. A very nice assistant showed me round the sauna/hammam facility on the morning I arrived - I did intend to use it but in the end I didn't have time. Pool. Bit chilly when I was there, and I got back too late to use it in the evenings. It has a very nice aspect right next to the creek and the boats so really quite a pleasant spot. So all in all really pretty good and I will definitely go back for business in the area. Though if business was in town then I would go elsewhere. The hotel is only about 10 mins from the airport so that is handy (especially if you have a 02h40 flight home like I did!) The hotel can organise a shuttle car to pick you up at the airport (I called them to ask about something else and they mentioned this by chance, so if you are booked into a club room and are a SPG guest then do give them a ring and request this service).", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel and good location\u201d", "Author": "rayd01", "ReviewID": "UR124392260", "Content": "This Sheraton is located very near DXB and is only a about a $10 cab ride from the airport.

Despite of providing our flight details as part of our reservation I had to write an extra email to receive a confirmation for the pick-up service included in our rate. Upon arrival the driver was not there. He only showed up 15' after my reminder call to the hotel (takes about 15' from the hotel to the airport). We queued at the reception only to see the receptionist get up and disappear for good when it finally was our turn w/o as much as a glance, greeting or apology. The next receptionist took 20' to get us checked in - despite of all personal details being provided as part of our online reservation and readily available in the system - and commented while handing us the key cards for the reserved club floor room overlooking the creek 'do you mind if there's drilling and hammering next to your room, we are remodelling our top floors?' Yes, surprisingly we did mind with the result that 10' later and after a few phone calls she down graded us to the 4th floor - w/o a word of apology (and quite naturally at the inital rate).

I was attending a conference that was being held here and arrived about 01.30 in the morning. The hotel sent a car and driver to pick me up at the airport; I was tired but greeted warmly and efficiently at check in and promptly ushered to my room on the club floor. The room was was adequate and what I expected - nicely decorated and comfortable. I was absolutely impressed during my stay with the staff. Everywhere I went, I was greeted by name or with a timely felicitation. All professionals - all engaged. And all seemed to enjoy their jobs. And I would give the hotel a five star rating except for the following. 1) Your beds are soft and so are your pillows. 2) Not that I'm a TV addict - I rarely watch it but when I'm traveling I like to tune into news channels. But my television did not work. They had a special channel for SPG guests; all I got was snow. 3) The food and beverage manager doesn't get it. Being an agribusiness consultant and taking food processors to market, I happen to be abreast of food trends. And I know that healthy lifestyle foods are gaining a lot of traction worldwide. Given SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) treatment, I went to the Club Lounge the next morning for breakfast and found a diabetic's worst nightmare - nothing here I could really eat to satisfy myself. So I skipped breakfast after nibbling on some olives. The conference - organized by a group from Singapore - was poorly managed in terms of time and still had not adjourned for lunch by 13.30. Having skipped breakfast I had to get something to eat so I went to the restaurant off the lobby. Again, a diabetic nightmare. The next morning, having learned my lesson at the Club Lounge, I went back to the lobby restaurant to see if the food and beverage manager could improve his offerings for a healthy breakfast. I was greeted with French toast, noodles (noodles?), chicken teriyaki, choices of breads, fried potatoes, etc. I did manage to get some baked beans, a grilled tomato, a bowl of fruit and a probiotic yogurt. Really, your F&B manager should know that the prevalence of diabetes among citizens of the UAE is the second highest in the entire world. Between that and the fact that some people just like to have a healthy meal should compel him/her to doing a much better job of diversifying the menu. 4) Managing a regional office, I need to stay in touch. Cell phone and SMS messages are not enough. I need to review documents prior to presentations or submittal and I need to communicate thoughts in writing that exceed short SMS strictures. And twice a month I need to approve electronic time sheets. So here was my greatest disappointment about this hotel. I simply was unable to take advantage of the \"high speed network\" that they touted in their reservation acknowledgement. My room was hard wired with an Internet cable but pages wouldn't load. I finally called the front desk and they sent a technician. I asked him what the speed was supposed to be and he responded 100mbps. I told him it was more like 100kbps. That failed. I then took my laptop to the lobby to see if I could connect on WiFi - marginally better but still took me 11 minutes to download a 1.2MB document. So in order to approve electronic time sheets that simply were not opening in my room (hardwired cable!) or on WiFi in the lobby, I paid a visit to the business center. Really not much better but I accomplished my objective. Later in the conference I was talking to a European executive and we agreed to exchange e-mails, but I told him it would have to wait until I got back to Cairo as the Internet was problematical in the hotel. He agreed, saying it was \"rubbish.\" So there you have it. All during my stay I kept hearing about $6 billion in enhancements to the chain. Here's my recommendation: spend a few thousand more dollars on a server and a decent ISP so you can accommodate your business guests.

Upon arrival, we were told we would be \"lucky\" to get a table before service closed, and some people had been waiting for up to half an hour.

First off, it is located in a good area, right on the Creek. We paid around $300/night for a King bed with a creek view. Well, we did get all of that. But, we were put in a wheel chair accessible room. The room itself was fine, but the bathroom is where we had some issues. The shower was meant to accommodate a wheel chair, so it was just a curtain and a shower head. The shower head was at about armpit level on me, so it was a bit difficult to shower. Not only that, when you turned on the shower, the entire bathroom flooded. The shower was not separated from the remaining portion of the bathroom at all. The drainage was so inadequate that there would be about an inch or two of standing water on the floor and it would spill out into the room. When we went down to ask for another room, we were offered a city view with 2 double beds. The other option was for housekeeping to come mop the floor after each shower! Since we did not want to downgrade our room, we chose to have housekeeping mop the floor. Figured we would at least make them do some work. We also asked for a non slip mat for the bathroom (the floors were all marble and quite slippery). We asked a few times and never received it. When we checked out, I again complained about our room and was just met with a smile and a nod. No one seemed to care. Also, when you stay at a Sheraton, you usually get the nice Sheraton pillows.

They offered an upgrade with my room which I refused because I wanted to keep my creek view room, but the gesture was kind. Room was large , lovely view over the creek and pretty comfortable.

The big problem was the hotel is understaffed and the actual staff is willing but not necessarily trained enough. Just an example: in 7 days staying I've always seen the same 3 people at the reception desk. Morning, evening or night it's always the 3 of them. The pool was a disaster...after 2 days we got a notice to say it have to go under a small maintenance and that they'd kept it close for 8 hrs the following day...when we left, 5 days later, it was still closed. Worst thing is that we never got any apology letter from the staff. The gym indeed was nice, not big but pretty decent.

We stayed here because everything else was fully booked. It is a mixed review with some \"great\" things and some \"not\". Smooth check-in, not the same for the check-out though, so don't be overly time optimistic if you have an early flight. The rooms are a bit old fashioned, but still clean and neat. The second time we got a room with a beautiful river view.\u00a0 The bathrooms are also old fashioned in marble, but clean and nice. However the showers are not working correctly, one second you are skulled hot and a few minutes later it gets cold. I called the guest services about it and I was told that it was probably because they were doing some renovation on some floors.\u00a0 Positives: We celebrated new years eve at the hotel, possibly the best buffet I have had ever and I have tried a lot. The hotel has three restaurants; Italian, Indian and Sushi. All three of them had open buffet, so that you could go to any one you like. The food was absolutely \"amazing\". The service and attention was also awesome, especially the restaurant managers. Even though they had a full house they took the time to locate grapes for the Spanish in our group that has the tradition to eat 12 grapes at the twelve \"strokes\" at midnight on new years eve. Photo with chef Ruben. They also had live entertainment. \u00a0 The breakfast buffet in the vivaldi restaurant was really great as well.\u00a0 The hotel has a small pool, nothing special. Very friendly staff, especially the restaurants personnel and the bell boys. Negatives: The in-room dining service experience was not as good. The first night we asked for fish-n-chips, and both my daughter and I got sick. At our second stay we asked for club sandwich that was ok, but it took more than 36 minutes. I mention this because the hotel promise if in-room dining is not served in 30 min or less it's free, but they still argued they did and charged for it. \"Don't promise what you can't keep\".", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Crete, Greece", "Title": "\u201cSylvia Bates (Crete)\u201d", "Author": "Sylvia B", "ReviewID": "UR122558063", "Content": "We had our first trip to Dubai to celebrate our Golden Wedding when we arrived they upgraded us to a club creek room the view was stunning.The rooms were cleaned every day with clean bedding and towels.

It is true that this hotel is older than most of the hotels in Dubai, that are located in modern buildings and have impressive lobbies and restaurants and modern furniture, however, it is a very nice hotel and from some aspects, I personally like it better than some of the newly built hotel. First of all, it is beautifully located upon the Dubai Creek, with lovely views. You can have your breakfast / lunch in the beautiful Vivaldi restaurant, sit out on the terrace and spent a lovely time by the Creek, watching the dhows and abras. For me, this was my favorite part of this hotel - while in other hotels in Dubai, you always have to sit inside, in luxury, but air conditioned rooms, with no view. My room was facing the main avenue upon which the hotel is, and on the first night I had an issue with the noise from the traffic - probably others would not find it annoying, but I am a light sleeper. A pair of ear plugs and the problem was solved. I think if you get a Creek view room you will not have a problem - plus the views are amazing, you can see all the way to Burj Khalifa and other big skyscrapers in Dubai center. The room was huge, nicely decorated, spotless. Had a fully stocked minibar, but everyday we had 2 coplimentary bottles of mineral water placed in our room. We were welcomed by a plate of local fruits, and there was also a kettle with a selection of coffees and teas. The cleaning staff was exceptional, very discrete, and they were replenishing each day the bathroom amenities. Very comfortable bed, nice big bathroom. About the internet, it is true there is no wifi in the rooms, however, in the end for me it was better as the connection speed with the wire was better and was not interrupted, as it happens some times with the wifi. Also, i have never been to a 5 star hotel where the internet is not charged. I asked people who stayed in other hotels in Dubai, and they all had to pay extra for the internet. The only times when i did not have to pay extra, was when there was an agreement prior to the booking between the hotel and the agency, to include the internet in the pre agreed rate. Breakfast was very nice, with a big selection of local and international food. We also had lunch in Vivaldi's terrace, they had an italian buffet, and it was very nice and tasty. We also had a few drinks in Chelsea Arms pub - nice decor and atmosphere. There is also a souvenir shop, a hair salon, a shop with carpets, a shop with jewelry and a spa - i just visited the hair salon, service was very good. We had some meetings at the hotel, the business center was very good and the people working there very helpful. One of the biggest advantages of this hotel is the staff - they are all very helpful, quick and friendly.

It was on the 2nd floor, old, tatty and noisy above the lobby. I asked why it wasnt on the club floor as just paid the upgrade? Apparently because of the noise from the building work We then realised that our daughter couldnt use the club Lounge with us after 5pm as they served Alchohol, so decided really if the Club floors were noisy and we couldnt enjoy the club room in the evening then there wasnt any point paying the upgrade, so we downgraded back to our City basic room! As we preferred a king room then the wait would be 4 hours, fine we went for an early dinner and pid \u00a360 for 3 burgers and 3 drinks!

The hotel is ageing and decor is very traditional and would be familiar to anyone who has stayed in a Sheraton in Europe or USA but very well maintained and the room was spacious with a very comfortable king bed. The full height windows could be opened (unusual in newer hotels in Dubai) which was great for evening photos of the creek. Generally the service was excellent and staff very helpfull. Buffet breakfast in the Vivaldi restaurant (included in our room rate) was very comprehensive catering for all nationalities but now for the first watchout: We would NOT recommend the Vivaldi for dinner as the service was more \"Faulty Towers\" than Sheraton Towers. We waited 40 minutes for simple 1st course dishes only to receive the wrong order. The head waiter's response was a joke so we cancelled and left without sampling the food which appeared to be somewhat expensive anyway and the tables looked like they were set for breakfast! Not to worry, Dubai has no shortage of restaurants so this is just something to consider when staying at the hotel. The only other problems related to taxis. Once despite being assured that we were given a metered taxi, it proved not to be. This was reported to Guset Services who did seem concerned and said they would look into it. The second taxi problem was with our airport transfer on departure. Despite having the reservaton confirmed the evening before we found our car had taken another guest and was not available at the alloted time. This only caused a 10 minute delay but required some \"assertive discussion\" with the duty manager who at 1st seemed to think an apology would suffice.

The tiles were old and mouldy, the sanitaryware looked ancient and i honestly felt like i was in a 2-star hotel bathroom. The shower in my room also seemed to be erratic; i would be showering with warm water and every few minutes a sudden burst of boiling water would come out (this happened throughout my stay). The housekeeping used to respect my \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door every day, but instead he would be banging his trolley and making a racket outside my door from about 7 a.m. every morning.

The greatest asset are, without question, the staff, who are, each and every one of them SUPERB! Nothing is too much trouble and everything is done with extreme politeness and a smile. The hotel is about a 10 - 15 minute walk from Union metro station and that (to be honest) is the easiest way to get about. It's about a 20 minute walk from the Gold Souq and a 20 minute metro ride from the Dubai Mall/Mall of the Emirates. One tip - try the Samad Iraqi Restaurant, Al Muraqqabat Road (18th Road) - which is about a 15 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride from the hotel - amazing food at really really reasonable prices (150ish AED for dinner for two!!!).

This was my second visit, so I knew what to expect in terms of location and amenities. This time we decided to book a Towers room though, treat ourselves to the extras. Although I know it's really a business hotel, I didn't want to go to a resort and deal with screaming kids peeing in the pool and Russian lesbians hogging the sunbeds. Location is great, only 15 mins from the airport, 10 minutes from the Gold Souk and 20-30 minutes from the malls - depending on traffic. Getting taxis is easy, though it would be nice if the drop off area out the front of the hotel weren't parked up with cars, so you could take your time over getting in/out and paying. It's nice to be able to walk along the creek in the evening, and check out all the boats. We contacted them 2 weeks in advance to get an early check in, which they said wasn't a problem. Airport transfer was fine, got the Cayenne, figured we were onto a winner. So was more than a bit peeved to be told that as the hotel had been full the previous night, and our room wasn't ready. They asked for a couple of hours, so we went and had breakfast, then had a snooze by the pool. 2 hours later we returned, and given that we'd booked a Towers room, I was a bit miffed to be given a Classic Room, even it had been upgraded to a Creek view. Bear in mind we'd had an overnight flight, and I hadn't had any sleep, all I wanted was to get into my room, get into my swimsuit and crash by the pool. And by the time we'd unpacked, I couldn't face repacking and fighting with reception to get another room. So no idea what the Towers room looked like. Our Classic room was fine, plenty of wardrobe space, king size bed, sofa, desk etc. Bathroom was standard Sheraton brown marble, planty of mirrors and big towels, however the grouting between the tiles really needs replacing. The poor design of the shower means that water cascades over the side of the bath and floods the floor by the toilet - so that area is all black with mildew. I had to downgrade my sleep quality, owing to the Aircon which seemed to be a bit random, kept resetting in the night. And as our room was right by the loft lobby, we had to listen to everyone either waiting, or getting out. Housekeeping was good, bathroom bits replaced everyday, only problem we had was with getting clean glasses. They left us a plate of fruit each day, can I suggest they add a knife? There's wifi in the lobby, and I think maybe the Lounge; the room had a wired connection which didn't seem to be free, given the argument we overheard with a guy as he was checking his bill befiore checking out. Or maybe thyat was another Towers option we missed out on. The pool isn't huge, and for me was too warm - which could just be due to the fact that the sun warms it up, being so small. There were plenty of sunbeds, given that there can't have been more than 10 of us there at any time. If you ask me, they should get rid of the tennis court and make the pool bigger. Didn't use the Spa or Health Club, so no comment. All massages though, no beauty treatments All 3 of the restaurants are fabulous where the food is concerned, although service is slow even though there are loads of staff and I found the live music in the Indian to be too loud for us to have a conversation above it. Coming from the UK, it was particularly nasty to find that the Chelsea Arms still allows smoking - even most places in Europe don't allow this now. The air conditioning seems to keep the place cool, but doesn't remove the fug. Good choice of beers, nice and cold. Someone tell me why the Towers lounge is on the lobby floor, with no windows? I had expected it to be at least on the 8th floor, with a decent view - I bet more people would use it if it was. As it happened, it was usually deserted apart from the folks using the free internet to access their facebook accounts. The hot canapes served in the early evening didn't seem to be kept hot enough, and there was nothing to keep the flies off the cold food. Don't get me wrong, I had a lovely week; I didn't have to fight for a sunbed, the food was good, the G&Ts strong - I just can't help feel I was short changed by my Classic room.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery underwhelmed by service provided when we needed it most\u201d", "Author": "foxystoat1", "ReviewID": "UR74486437", "Content": "Was supposed to be staying at the Sheraton Dubai Creek for 6 nights as part of a honeymoon in the United Arab Emirates. Arrived late evening only to be told that our booking had been cancelled as the agents we had booked the reservation with had filed for bankruptcy protection in the USA 5 days before our wedding and the actual reservation was cancelled by the third party (who had not been paid by the agents) on the day of our wedding, two days before arrival. Were provided an alternative room within the hotel but not at the rate I had previously booked the room for. Room was standard business traveller fayre (3rd foor), albeit a little oversized, bathroom was good, plenty of lotions available. Good views over the creek. However, the arrival in the room was tarnished by an over zealous porter who, having been tipped what I felt was an appropriate amount, felt it necessary to ask me \"Are you aware of the value of currency in this country?\"This left a sour taste with us, especially having travelled most of the day only to find out about the reservation had been cancelled. Spent most of the night trying to sort out the cancelled reservation issue with the reception staff and Duty Manager, who were distant when i was explaining the situation, and did not leave me feeling that I was in need of assistance, desk staff more interested with checking their computers than providing eye to eye contact.The Duty Manager did allow me use of the internet facilities to sort out arrangements. Having tried (unsuccessfully) to resolve the issue with Starwood (Sheraton parent company) via the LiveChat facility on their website, I found another hotel nearby (The SAS Radisson) and made a booking for the rest of the week at their hotel. Early next morning, I checked out the Sheraton in more detail. Although initially impressed with the grandeur of the lobby area (the interior reminded me of the Luxor in Las Vegas, a tall, triangular structure, the pool area was on the small side, and there seemed a lac of things for the holidaymaker to do within the hotel (there was an English bar, an Indian Restaurant and another dining area where the internet facilities were, other than that, there didn't seem too much to do . There are three desks at reception, it took about 20 minutes to eventually get seen to not because there were lots of customers, it seemed that each customer was with each receptionist for a long long time, when eventually got to the check-out, it took a long time to manage this process, with the credit card authorisation and the passing over of the invoice from a receptionist who again, seemed distant and not providing me with her fullest attention. In hindsight, it turned out that our booking being cancelled turned out for the best as we had an absolutely amazing experience at the nearby SAS Radisson, 400 yards along the road (I will be reviewing the Radisson in the next day or two...). I dare say the Sheraton is a good hotel for the business traveller and casual visitor, but we were left very disappointed with our experience on what should have been one of the most happiest times of our lives.

As a part of the package paid by my company I got picked up by a driver at the airport. If the pick-up service deal is not a part of your package, there is no need to think you need to book this service. It is much cheaper to take a normal taxi from the airport to the hotel. In fact I would advise you to avoid the hotel\u2019s own car service during your stay if you want to save money. The hotel cars do not have a taxi sign, but they have meters that are running at a higher rate than normal taxis. Just ask the porter for a normal taxi when you need transport. Normal taxis in Dubai are clean and safe. Check-in process was a bit slow, but the receptionists are polite and friendly. My room was on the second floor with twin beds and it was rather spacious with comfortable beds. There is wired internet in the room that you can use for a fee. The bathroom was very clean and had a nice selection of bathroom supplies. The buffet breakfast in the Vivaldi restaurant had a great selection of food. It was still possible to sit outside on the restaurant\u2019s balcony to enjoy the breakfast and the view of the creek during my stay. The lunch was served in the Creekside restaurant. This food was OK. However, at night this is a Japanese restaurant and the food is fantastic. We had dinner here one night when it was Asian buffet and I still dream of the fabulous sushi, teppanyaki and the dessert. Another highlight in the hotel is the Indian restaurant, Ashiana, rated as one of the best Indian restaurant in Dubai. Several nights were spent in the pub, which was also OK.

When you ask for normal taxi, they tell you no taxi , you wait !!!. and they let you wait .... Knowing there are many taxi's. ( We experience twice the taxi driver dropped a client by the hotel and immediately he was ask to leave quickly, I notice this and quickly we jump in to this taxi than the taxi driver told us that they where chased away because the doorman want to push the hotel taxi's.The best is, we walked to the road and catch a taxi from there,within minutes.

I ask information for shopping mails, I have spoken to 5 staff and still they give me the wrong information. In general the hotel is sure not a 5 star, and not ready to serve there clients. When we checked out, and they ask how was our stay , and we mention our experiences, they looked at us like what to do. like its normal. No reaction given. or apology.

I shall come to the point immediately : PROS: 1. Centrally located, Five star property with all amenities, good brand image, comfortable, convenient, clean rooms, great view of the dubai creek, ok food, courteous staff but just two points for true value. CONS: 1. Service is not impeccable. 2. The comfort does not give you a feeling of wholesome satisfaction. 3. Although all amenities are available, they are more for namesake than for real pleasure, like the small swimming pool and the old lobby. 4. The service of Sheraton is there, but not upto the mark, like at the restaurant in the morning, you keep asking for a cup of coffee, but there is nobody to attend to you, they are under-staffed. 5. The hotel is pricey. 6. The ambience could be better. The hotel definitely needs renovation at both lobby level and the rooms too. Even while we stayed at the executive suite, i wanted to shout \"ive seen better \". They could do with speedier check-inns/ check outs. 7. A hotel which has even just four guests at a suite, who all are pure vegans, and they dont get one single vegan dish at the breakfast buffet deserves a thumbs down? VERDICT: No dont bother with Sheraton Dubai Creek Hotel, at the same price you can get a better hotel, even the same starwood or sheraton brand. Dont be fooled by the central location, in Dubai, with good roads and efficient transportation, Jumeriah Beach is a better location where you can find better hotels at lesser price and you can be in the city centre in 10-15 minutes. The city is full of other 5 star properties, and you can get a better bargain than this.

Check in was easy with no wait, although the offset chairs at the check-in desks are a little awkward. I prefer an old-fashioned check-in desk. My travel companions were Starwood Gold using points for a free stay and they were upgraded to an upper-floor creek view. I am a normal level Starwood preferred guest and was not automatically upgraded, contrary to what other reviewers have said. I was given a first-floor room with a view over the front of the hotel. Nice room - good bathroom, great shower, comfy beds. However, the location was awful. I barely slept, with the noise of guests in the lobby, then what sounded like someone pounding rocks, then with the sound of vacuuming in the lobby for several hours - may have been normal cleaning, may have been special work? Anyway, stay away from first floor rooms overlooking the lobby if you want to sleep. My first morning I learned that I would have to fly home that evening due to a family emergency. The hotel was very accommodating and waived any fees for checking out early. They even gave me a complementary late checkout. I left luggage with the bellman for a few hours with no problems. Very easy to get cabs from the front. The internet, as others have noted, is ludicrously expensive. 120 AED a day, which is $32/day. There is no excuse for this - that's more than I pay for a month at home. Services in Dubai are expensive, but not that expensive - it costs the hotel nothing incrementally to have more guests logged on. Next time I am going to verify internet rates in advance and not stay anywhere that charges over $10-15/day. Gauging your customers on small things like internet (or mini-bar) is a good way not to get repeat business. So nice hotel - if they bring their internet charges back down to a reasonable level I would consider staying there again.

In summary the hotel stay was really nice and I would probably stay there again... We stay on the 9th floor in a Towers Room. In the room it tells you that the rate is 3200Dhs/night for a Towers Room and about Dhs850 for a normal room. The Towers room was massive, full size bed, LCD TV, DVD player, Hairdryer, Sofa and Armchair, Coffee machine (as part of minibar). The view out of the window was pretty amazing as well, as we had a room that overlooked the Creek. The bathroom is quite large, the shower is powerful, and the mirror is heated so it doesnt steam up! You also get access to the towers lounge, which is a large quite with a few sofas, single computer internet access, and a TV. Here you have access to complimentary coffee, tea and non-alcholic drinks. Canapes are served around tea time, and complimentary alcohol is served between 6.30-8pm. We got this at a discounted price, but I wouldn't have paid the full whack for it. Breakfast is served in the Towers Lounge (continental) or in the italian restaurant in the lobby (full range of items). The atmosphere downstairs is much better, and you have the option of seating on the terrace above the pool over looking the Creek. The Service of the staff is flawless. We had an early flight, and so the hotel had shifted our booking to pay for the extra early check, which I wasn't too happy about. However after a little bit of negotiating, we managed to have that waiived. (I was prepared to wait 5hrs in the lobby until the appropriate check in time). The person that stands out the most was the conceirge. He knew practically everything about where to go and what to do. Having a Towers reservation we were picked up from the airport in a Porsche Cayenne S... Quite a welcome to my first trip to Dubai. I didnt visit the gym, but the pool is nice, and was never too busy. Though some may find it small. The hotel interior is lovely, though I am told its is not as grand as some of the hotels further out of the city. The Lobby restaurant serves excellent food. The Abra crossings are about a 15min walk down the creek, and there is a stop for the air-con boat about 5mins walk away. There is also a Bank next door for cash withdrawals if you require. Location wise, the hotel is on the Deira side of the river, so is quick to travel to from the gold souk, though anywhere else on the otherside of the Creek requires the taxis to cross over one of the two bridges, which lengthens commutting time a fair bit.

Starwood offer a Best Price Guarantee, though I beat the rate quoted by the Hotel by 37%. To prove the rate, I had to make the booking, which then involved a 15% (First Day) cancellation fee. Starwood offered to match the rate I had paid and then beat it by 10% - which would of course have still cost me 5% overall. I asked if this discounted rate or % could be commuted to a future reservation in the same hotel and was told that it couldn't. So, don't trust Starwood's promises then... 2. Internet for 13 days was charged 3 times at AED700, which is what I pay for a year at home. That is the weekly rate - I was charged 3 times, but my stay was less that 2 weeks. Go figure! The internet connection is crushingly slow and the hotel are not interested in resolving it, even for AED2,100 (\u00a3400). 3. My room rate included breakfast and when I arrived there was a letter in the room advising that this could be selected from the Room Service menu. For the first 4 days this was fine, then on the 5th the Room Service guy told me that the policy had changed and I would have to eat in the restaurant. Fine, but why leave it to me to find out? Couldn't they manage expectations a bit better? 4. I confirm that a single Snickers or Choclolate bar costs AED32 (\u00a36); so does a packet of chips, nuts, a can of Coke or a bottle of water. I expect Ice Cubes do too, but - as with all the other items - there is no price list and you only find out at checkout. 5. 12 black & white pages cost me AED95 (\u00a318) to print out; forget either the in-house printMe service or emailing your document to the Business Centre - the internet connection is too slow and they deny ever receiving it. Get a memory stick and go down in person. 6. Huge farce sending a single page fax to Hong Kong - ended up having to dial it myself and having an argument with the Business Center staff about the number. For this privilege - AED35 (\u00a36.75) 7. Don't expect any help with your bags after checkout; it's 50 metres to the door, and you will remember every one of them. Door staff surly and refuse to hail local cabs, only the retained limos. Traffic outside the hotel can be very congested. 8. Massage and Spa centre agreed a surprise package and schedule for my girlfriend face-to-face with me, then when she turned up for her surprise she was told they were busy, kept waiting for an hour and then turned away and told to come back the next day. She didn't. 9. I shouldn't complain about the complimentary fruit bowl, as it was free. I'll therefore just mention that the strawberries had mould on them, and I took them down to reception to prove it. 10. Multiple local phone calls charged on my bill; very cheap, but I didn't actually make any local calls. Don't know what was going on there. Conclusion - rubbish and way too much top notch competition in the immediate area (Hilton, Radisson SAS etc) - and I will certainly never stay there again.

Fortunately, the Sheraton reservations department alerted us to this and after about 6 weeks of hassle we were assured by the web comapny it had been sorted out. The day we travelled an alert member of the Sheraton reservations department e-mailed us to say the web company had cancelled our last night's stay. On our arrival at the Sheraton we were upgraded to a beautful room overlooking Dubai Creek. The receptionist and reservation staff spent 4 days trying to resolve our last night's stay with our travel agent. Thanks to the hard work and persistence of Miss Maleeha and Miss Honeylet they resolved our problem and made our stay a most memorable one. The hotel is a true 5* experience situated in a perfect location to discover Dubai. The breakfast was outstanding, you could eat outside on the luxurious terrace overlooking the Creek or inside. We had our last evening meal at the hotel's Ashiana restaurant voted the best Indian restaurant in Dubai by Time Out magazine. It was one of the best 'Indian's' I have ever had at a reasonable cost. The hotel management was attentive, without being overly intrusive, to ensure our stay was perfect. The celebration cake left in our room on the first night was a lovely surprise and tasted delicious. Thank you to all at the Sheraton and we would be very happy to recommend your hotel. P.S.

The hotel was a good 5-star hotel standard that you'd expect from any major city. Top quality without the mega-luxury you'd pay three times for. If you want to lay in the sun all day and spend a tonne on room service (and do nothing much else), then stay at the big resorts near the beach. However you can lay in the sun anywhere (and in much cheaper resorts with better beaches!). I recommend staying at this hotel and then you're only a stroll from the creek (creek is an understatement), the souks, the musuem, the river cruises and the open top bus tours (5 mins away). Although don't expect everything at your immediate doorstep - I'm a happy walker and all the above was within a 5-20 minute walk. I went past the beach front resorts on the bus tour and they seemed to be out in the middle of nowhere - you'd have to get a cab to go anywhere. Not my idea of a cultural experience! But each to their own. I was disappointed with the shopping malls - they're just shopping malls! Go to the souks and museum instead. Also highly recommend making a dinner reservation at the italian restaurant in the hotel - just remember to ask for a table on the non-smoking balcony. The breakfast was brilliant. The english style pub was a little disappointing - better to get room service! The hotel was very accommodating with my early arrival time too - they let me sleep out on a sun lounge near the pool (which was also very nice btw) for a little while, and then I ended up getting checked in early by about 1030am.

Firstly, don't be put off by the location of the hotel. Being in the city has many advantages, and regardless, taxis are plentiful and cheap (by Australian standards). Make sure that you book a room in the Tower section of the hotel, and pay (or beg) for a room that overlooks the Dubai creek. This is definitely worthwhile. The Sheraton Dubai Creek is a very comfortable 5 star hotel. It is not the newest hotel in Dubai but the rooms are clean, a reasonable size, and well maintained. We stayed for 6 nights and were always greeted by staff at the hotel by our names, and nothing was too much trouble. Hotel dining expenses are exactly what you would expect to pay for this class of hotel. The biggest decision facing somebody contemplating Dubai is whether to stay at the beach, or in the city. This decision can only be based on what you want from your holiday!! Jumeirah Beach is great, although somewhat isolated, but again, taxis are plentiful. Regardless, I think that Dubai now represents a genuine holiday destination, and is no longer merely a \"stop-over\". We had 7 great days, being a combination of activities and relaxation, and could have stayed longer. Must do's are : Wild Wadi; Desert Safari; Gold Souk; Mall of the Emirates; Dubai creek dinner cruise. Many comment about the ongoing building, and traffic, in Dubai. Yes, many areas are disrupted by building, but this is not \"intrusive\" to the point of annoyance. Indeed, you are witnessing the birth of a totally modern city that will be one of the world's great travel destinations. Secondly, traffic is heavy (particularly during rush hour) but if you avoid travelling in those peak times, the delays are minimal (common sense!). Ladies, your dress should be \"conservative\". Bikinis are fine at the beach/hotel pool, but not appreciated elsewhere. Longer dresses (about knee length) or jeans, and covered shoulders are the norm in shopping malls and on the street. The only disappointment was the Dubai Zoo. It was not to the 1st class level I expected of this outstanding city. In fact, I thought it was a bit sad. Nevertheless, Dubai offers a fantastic variety of activities, only limited by your time, and your wallet. Dubai, and the Sheraton Dubai Creek Hotel, are strongly recommended.

I had a city creek view room and it was well worth it watching the dhow boats and other traffic go up and down Dubai Creek at all hours and a view of the city, Burj Dubai - the tallest building in the world(still under construction as well as most of Dubai) and other towers in the distance. The pool area wasn't too busy during the day so getting a seat was no problem. The gym was adequate as were the steam room and sauna in the change rooms. A good thing to note, staying at the Sheraton Dubai Creek means you can also use the facilities of the Sheraton Jumeirah Beach for a small fee of 75 dhs. A free shuttle bus takes you there from the hotel at 10.00 and returns from the Jumeirah Sheraton at 16.30. You can use all their facilities, beach, pool, gym and add bills to your own hotel room back at Dubai Creek. This is a cheaper alternative than staying there. The location of the hotel was good for getting around and picking up taxis. They are very cheap and ask for a local taxis as the hotel ones have meters too but they are more expensive and unlike local taxis, the fare goes up while you are waiting. So if you are stuck in traffic moving nowhere, the meter keeps going up. Food wise, there wasn't much around the hotel. However, the hotel has some good restuarants including Vivaldi (Italian) and a Japanese restuarant which is supposedly one of the best in Dubai. Not far, about 5 mins walk away is the Hilton Dubai Creek that has a Gordon Ramsay restaurant worth checking out. Also, you have the Deira City Centre, a shopping centre, just a short taxi ride (10 dhs) from the hotel with a large foodcourt and restaurants at very reasonable prices but don't plan on getting a taxi very quickly back to the hotel. Waits can be from 1 - 2 hours after 4pm. One night, my partner and I went to a restaurant at the Burj Al Arab which gave us entry into the 7* hotel. The skyview bar and the restaurant in the balIroom have views from the 27th floor while the others are near the ground floors. I would highly recommend this experience, wonderful views and service giving you an insight of how the very wealthy dine. To make sure you get a table I would book before you arrive as several of the restaurants were booked out for the whole month of April. The hotel location is also good for the big bus tour (175 dhs) as there is a stop (Stop 7) about 500m from the hotel towards the gold souk before the Radisson SAS. This gives you a good chance to see Dubai, their beaches and shopping malls as it stops at quite a few including the Mall of Emirates and Deira City Centre. The gold souk is a wonderful opportunity to test your haggling skills and also get you out of the heat into air conditioned comfort. Prices on items are just a guide. Remember the prices are heavily inflated and its a bit of fun to see how low you can get them. Aim for about 35 - 40% off the original price and if you don't get your price, don't worry, there are many more shops around and if they really want the sale they will chase you back to the store. Also, if you want to get any goods, electronics etc, don't get it from the airport as you will find the prices cheaper at the local shopping centres. A great excursion in the afternoon is a Desert Safari which includes 4x4 driving over sand dunes, camel and quad bike riding, bbq dinner at a Bedouin camp and a belly dancing performance. Prices can be from 150 - 375 dhs per person. The cheaper ones you get a bus out to the site while the more expensive ones pick you up and return you to the hotel in your own 4x4 or even a Hummer. The food is great, plentiful, the drive over the sand dunes is like a roller coaster. A great way to spend an evening. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton Dubai Creek and Dubai and the great deal I got from DubaiResorts.com made the stay well worth it. I would recommend this hotel to all groups, family, business persons, honeymooners etc.", "Date": "April 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cAn oasis of calm\u201d", "Author": "globalskier100", "ReviewID": "UR12928043", "Content": "Just over a wall from the bustling dhow wharfage of Dubai Creek, the Sheraton is an oasis of calm.

The staff was very helpful and pleasant. i I am a starwoods member but unfortunately was not upgraded. we had a city view room but we were not disappointed as i enjoyed checking out the traffic before i went downstairs everyday! we were offered a fruit plate to our room everyday free of charge. there was a coffee/tea service that was also free, but had a 5dhs ( 1 euro) delivery fee billed to the room. we were very happy with the location, as it allowed us to stroll at night along the dock, and also take the dhows or water taxi over to the \"old\" part, dubai museum, heritage village and textile souks. our return trip to the airport on a friday night at 10.30 pm took about 10 minutes and cost 3 euros (15dhs)!! as mentioned, watching the water traffic was especially entertaining during dinner and breakfast on the covered terrace. the breakfast buffet was very well presented and tasty. there is a chef making eggs and the staff is very attentive throughout the entire hotel. The menu prices were some of the most reasonable of the MANY restaurants we tried. The quality was excellent. Reserve the terrace in advance as outside dining fills up quickly. However, the view from most tables inside is also good. we were allowed to use the health club and pool while waiting for our room, and also the last evening, as our return flight left at 1.30 a.m., we had a steam bath and shower before our long flight home. The area around the sheraton is totally built up so we experienced no construction noise whatsoever. The National Bank of Dubai is next door with a drive through ATM you can use anytime, which is convenient. The building next to that is a government building which has a public cafeteria that makes the most delicious fruit drinks/dishes. The most important thing is to organize your outings in a logical sequence, since, no matter where you are staying, you do not want to be criss- crossing with the horrendous traffic you find on most roads and especially at certain times of day. Golfers wanting to play Dubai Creek Golf Club will be happy with the short ride (5 minutes). This club also has SEVERAL fabulous restaurants. we thouroughly enjoyed our stay here, although it is not a jaw-droppng experience like you find up at the top beach resorts, but we didn\u00b4t feel spending more than double or triple what we were paying here was worth the difference for the type of vacation we are used to taking.", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holland", "Title": "\u201cA very good place to stay\u201d", "Author": "LiaSlappendel", "ReviewID": "UR10467700", "Content": "Last Summer we went to Dubai and stayed in Sheraton Dubai Creek and Towers.

The hotel room was clean and comfortable. A room with a view of the Creek, towards the new city is very pleasant. The hotel facilities (gym and pool) were of a high standard. Hotel food was excellent. The service was excellent in parts (front desk, restaurants, concierge) and shocking in others (\"Towers\" lounge). The hotel location is mixed - it really depends what you want to do. If you're a tourist, it's OK but expect to give yourself an hour to get to Mall of the Emirates, Burj Al Arab, Madinat, Jumeirah Beach Hotel etc. If you're on business, the location is a bit of a pain - give yourself a good 30 minutes to get to Jumeirah Emirates Towers or DIFC. It's a good location for the airport (15 minutes), the Gold Souk, and Burj Dubai. It's pretty easy to get a taxi, and the folks at the hotel are more than happy to provide you with detailed directions if you want to catch a boat somewhere (at the rear of the hotel). A few other points about this hotel: 1. I noticed that the hotel website makes a distinction between standard rooms and \"towers\" rooms. I was always under the impression that a \"towers\" room was something special. However, when I arrived at the hotel I discovered that almost all rooms are \"towers\" rooms. A bit of marketing puffery, I think! 2. The hotel tries to sting you real bad for trying to check-in early - watch out! In my case, they did allow me to check out at 3PM, and store my luggage, and use the health club to shower before taking a late flight. 3. If you do check-out, dont try to go into the \"towers\" lounge, they attempt to charge you for having a drink and a piece of fruit. 4. The hotel booking process was very annoying - five emails to get a \"towers\" room with two beds and early check-in! Overall, I think the hotel offers good value but I would try somewhere else next time.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel\u201d", "Author": "fisydney", "ReviewID": "UR10038208", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights on our first visit to Dubai.
