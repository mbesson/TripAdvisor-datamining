{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Arrive Early I booked to stay here for three nights in Sept 06. Although I had let the hotel know I would be arriving late, our flight was delayed and we didnt get to the hotel until midnight after a train/bus journey from Schonefeld Airport. When we arrived, the hotel was locked and the reception closed so we had no room for the night. We had to get on a bus and find another hotel (Novotel) which cost an extra 165 euro. When we did go back to the hotel the next day the lady was apologetic and we got our room. This was fine, room OK and good location. After some complaining to the manager, they didnt charge me for the first night. So my advice if staying here, make sure you arrive early.", "Date": "Oct 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR145729448", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Charlie_Lon"}, {"Content": "World Cup Hotel We just returned from our World Cup experience in Germany. This hotel was great, they spoke english were very helpfull with directions and the rooms were spotlessly clean. The view was not the greatest, it was of a busy street but who cares your on holidays you only sleep there. We had a five star breakfast every morning buffet style in the hotel restaurant, food was great and service excellent. This hotel is situated right beside grocery stores, drug stores and many street side restaurants where you can sit down in a relaxed atmosphere and have a beer or whatever. You will however need to use the bus or taxi to visit all the real tourist attractions in Berlin. the transit system is excellent and all the taxis are Mercedes. We took a few english guided walking tours and learned about all the history about the Berlin wall, checkpoint Charlie, museum island, took a boat tour and gasped at the magnificent architecture. Berlin was fantastic ever thought of visting DO IT!!! you'll be very satisfied. Bring your camera with lots of digital memory cards. In comparison we also stayed a few nights at the Best Western in Hamburg. The room was very small view was of a parking lot and the prices in their restaurant were very expensive..Hotel Schoneberg was excellent. We found the key entry system a little difficult to get the hang of, we all laughed because the hotel staff had to keep opening our door. They were very good about it and we finally got it.If you can get a room....... go for it.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR931480375", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d231110-r5911589-Schoeneberg_Hotel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "231110", "Price": "$124"}}
