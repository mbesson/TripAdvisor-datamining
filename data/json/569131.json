The staff was quite helpful although we arrived at the hotel around 12pm and we still had to wait 20min for the room to be ready. We were only 2 however we were given a very big room for 4 persons. Having entered the room just after the cleaning man we expected top cleanliness. To our surprise, the room was very dirty: stains on the sheets and the moquette, dirty curtains & mould on the bathroom's walls. One window couldn't close properly and since we went to Rome during the exceptional snow weather, it let a cold airstream. The room was well equipped: soap and shampoo, 3 towels per person (clean), mini-fridge, air-conditioner (that took a while to start), hair dryer... The breakfast was quite poor. During the last hour of our trip, I lost my wallet with my ID so there was no possibility of taking the plane back to Milan. I had the idea to call the hotel since they do a photocopy of our IDs at the check-in (the flight company was ok with the photocopy). However, the staff told me that unfortunately they throw everything after check-out. No possibility for me to take back the plane: I went back in train. According to the police officer (whom I talked to because of my lost wallet) hotel staff are obliged to keep all the documentation even after check-out. I guess they got a visit from the police the next day... The hotel is more of a B&B. The building isn't only for Giotto Flavia but holds 2 or 3 other \"hotels\" that apparently share agreements.

It's in a great location - close enough to the touristy things but far enough away to be out of the hustle and bustle. Our room was on the 6th floor and although rather spartan, was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was good and kept us going for a good long while (and the coffee machine at the entrance of the room makes really nice coffee). Roses: the Receptionists were great, really friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and we didn't think it was too noisy at all, unlike other reviewers. Yes, there's traffic, but we still slept really well. We found some great restaurants close to the hotel, not only were their prices a LOT cheaper than the ones closer to the tourist attractions (as in half price) but the food and ambience were fantastic - Ristorante Il Sorriso and the pizza place literally around the corner from the hotel are highly recommended. Thorns: The hotel is in dire need of refurbishment - the reception area is shabby and the carpet in the lobby needs a good scrub/ replacing. The room we stayed in had a dripping toilet which we couldn't stop and there were stains on the walls. It's the little things like this that make such a big difference and I think if they were sorted the hotel would be a lot more lucrative - it has a lot of promise but needs TLC and a good handyman.

I made an online booking which entitled me for the 30% discount. As a result a hotel room (double), with bathroom and decent breakfast cost me per person even less than a bed in a four persons hostel room with no bathroom (68 Euro/pax). Additionally, the hotel is located very close to the center and Termini Station. It is on a rather quiet street, close to nice restaurants and little grocery and food stores. Walking distance to most of the tourist attractions. There are indeed few hotels/b&b in the same building, but it's not very hard to find the proper floor and reception. We stayed in Giotto Flavia Hotel on the 6th floor. As recommended on the forum, I asked for the room facing the street, so to have a nice bright room. The view was nice, and a balcony was a big help for very nights. The room has air-conditioning, but it was little cold the first night when we kept it on all night. I recommend cooling the room before going to bed and sleep with the balcony open. Room was ok, although looked less attractive than on the hotel webside. Simple furniture (king sixe bed, little table with tv on, two small bedside tables, one stool). Bathroom was bright and spacious. Hotel provides towels, shampoo, soap. Housemaids clean it and make bed every day. Breakfast was ok, too. There are many guests and sometimes not enough tables, especially around 9:00 - 10:00 when most of the guests come. Food was typical Italian breakfast: rolls, sweet rolls, croissants, slices of yellow cheese and salami, marmolades, cornflakes, yogurts. Tea and coffee (yes, from the machine, but not that bad), joices (also from the machine, but was too scared to try :-). Whenever anything was running out, you could always ask the girl to bring more food, so you cannot really complain about it. Receptionists were nice and helpful. What we didn't like were: 1. Very dirty (small) elevator where only two lamps (out of four) were working, including one hanging unsafely out of the ceilling. 2. Tv had only few Italian channels and not all of them working well. On the webside it is said there is satellite tv, but there was NONE. Moreover, Rome has just turned into digital tv and I doubt these tv sets are really prepared for the change. 3. The room smelled from drains. Every time when back to the room we had to open wide the balcony door (another advantage of the balcony) to get rid of the bad smell. We did complain about it, but they haven't/couldn't? help. To sum up, the hotel and rooms are little less clean and less perfect than on the website (http://www.hotelgiottoflavia.com), but the location and price are a big advantage.

We chose a 2 star quieter hotel away from the immediate city centre deliberately. We knew that everything would be walkable anyhow and these back and side streets of Rome are a delight. This hotel is situated off the main road and is in a typical Italian building complete with large shuttered windows. It is a very strange set up as the building appears to have a different hotel on every floor, the Giollo being on the 2nd. Glass doors into a foyer and take the lift. A small reception but the greeting from the owner (?) was warm and welcoming. Our room was average size but had a big bed, large wardrobe, very small bathroom/shower but still adequate but had a ceiling fan and air conditioning which seemed far more important than the size of the bathroom anyhow. Also wall TV and fridge. Do not expect luxury, this is 2 star here but the room was clean and cool. The breakfast room was long and narrow and the breakfasts nothing special. The juice was I am almost sure squash, there were carton yogurts, cellaphane wrapped croissants, rolls and usual jam/honey, cheese and meat. The 2 guys who seem to own the hotel, were absolutely brilliant. They advised us on how the pickpockets operate, called our tour operater when they failed to pick us up and sorted it for us, and offered general advice we found very helpful. Certainly we were able to walk to and from the sights etc easily from here. Although it obviously took us a bit longer in the heat, even a taxi wouldn't cost more than a few euro. We caught the shuttle bus direct to the hotel from the airport so I can't advise on the distance from the main train terminal, but probably not far although pulling a suitcase in the hot sun may not be advisable. The other good thing about this hotel is that there are 4 street cafes all within 50 metres and all a bit cheaper than those around the inner city. One does amazing pastries and we had evening meals at 2 others and these were both well recommended and reasonable given the current \u00a3/euro rate.

It was very dark, couldn't see even with all the lights on, the air-conditioning was actually a ceiling fan.

This hotel is on the second floor of a 4 story building (each floor is another hotel) The entrance hall is not attractive at all (I almost changed my mind about staying there when i saw it) and you have to take a rickety elevator up to the second floor, which was out of order at least once a day. The staff was very nice. We arrived 5 hours before check-in and they checked us in anyway and on the day we left they kept our baggage for several hours. The rooms was a decent size but the lighting was horrible...very dim, especially since the only window in the room faced a small open courtyard in the middle of the building, so there was no sunshine and not much light. The room and linens were very clean, however, the bathroom was very small and only had a shower, which you had to step up 12 inches to get in to...there was some mildew in the grout, which grossed me out a bit, but i managed since we were there only 2 nights. The breakfast that was included was ok...good coffee and choices from one of the those automatic machines where you press the button for expresso, cafe latte, hot chocolate, etc... There was some cereal, rolls, cheese, ham and yogurt and some sweet buns. It was a small dining room but very clean. I would only recommend this hotel to someone who was really traveling on a budget...it cost about 150 euros, which is very, very inexpensive for a decent location in Rome. OH...VERY IMPORTANT....HOTELS IN ROME ARE NOT PERMITTED BY LAW TO HAVE IRONS SO THEY ARE NOT AVAILABLE.", "Date": "June 13, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, Florida", "Title": "\u201cClean, inexpensive rooms - Great for budget traveller!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3285488", "Content": "We had booked to stay at Giotto Flavia because of the low price. However, when we arrived, there was some construction going on so the hotel kindly relocated us to another hotel across the street. Thus, though we did not stay in the hotel, I did have a chance to see the facilities and interact with the staff. The hotel is situated in the 3rd floor of an old building. Though you enter through an old lobby, the actual hotel lobby is very clean. It is very small, and there are no bells or whistles. Just a small reception area and several rooms. The area was very clean, as were the rooms inside. Given the price of this hotel, I would recommend it for students or other low-budget travellers. It is in an area that is about a 15 min walk to the spanish steps. We felt very safe in the area and there were several restaurants and cafes nereby.

Our room was pretty nice....very, very clean. The front desk staff was extremely helpful. Gave us plenty of advice, directions, etc. and was very pleasant in answering all of our questions. Breakfast was included and was ok, pretty much coffee and pastries and some fruit. The hotel was in a pretty busy area of town, I guess not so much a touristy area, but was about 5 min walking to the subway which we took everywhere with no problems. Only 2 subway stops away to the Vatican, and also easy to get to all other major sights.
