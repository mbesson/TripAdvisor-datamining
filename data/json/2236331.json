Unfortunately, it also attempts to be a club for 20-somethings, and does not enforce reasonable behavior on the part of its partying guests. So, although it has excellent bones, I cannot recommend it for anyone wanting a guarantee of a good night's sleep. Probably, the problem begins with the (unfortunately all too common) attempt to have both a trendy hangout and a hotel in one property. The hotel has a rooftop deck with a bar and a small swimming pool. This doubles as a club at night. Sadly, the club-goers need to take the elevator to the top floor of the hotel (which has sleeping rooms on it), and then go down a short hall to another elevator to the roof. Why would you do this to your hotel guests? We had a room which was somewhat like a small suite, with nice new fixtures and a cool bath. We did notice with surprise that the carpet was already stained. However, given the discussion below, one can understand why that might be the case. While we were there, there was a multi-night, multi-guestroom party on our floor. The last night we were there, this went on until daylight. The party goers went from room to room, with accompanying door slamming etc. Not only did we complain, but other guests did as well. At one point, we overheard a night clerk telling someone that that was their final warning. As this had no effect, I can only guess that it meant the hotel wouldn't bother them again! We got no sleep that night. The next morning, we complained about the problem. The manager told us how bad he felt about the problem - apparently the night manager had left a message about it. However, what he offered in compensation for completely ruining our visit was laughable. We did take brunch one morning on the rooftop. The staff were hopelessly slow and inept.

We basically liked the place, but my wife was very disappointed at the short, shallow pool. She needs to swim several times a week for health reasons, and felt that the picture of the pool on the website had been misleading (as they so often are). It's more of a recreational pool for people at the rooftop bar (nice view, pricy drinks, didn't try the restaurant with the celebrity chef). Otherwise, the place was pretty good. We had a minisuite with a sofabed, for which we paid well north of $200, listed as a discount rate--it was sort of a special occasion trip for us. But the main bed was big and very comfortable, even the sofabed wasn't bed--though it left a very tight passage in the room when it was open. The \"rain\" shower was excellent, and the bathroom area was helpfully divided up into shower stall, toilet room, and a sink/dressing area--though the shower and toilet didn't have opaque doors (there's a sliding door between the whole bathroom and the rest of the room). There were two giant TVs with plugs for video devices. A refrigerator but no microwave, and no radios or clocks! We had to light up our cell phones to check the time in the middle of the night. Parking was $26, plus 10% parking tax. Ironically, we had to park there because we'd driven down but were trying to do as much of the visit car-free as possible--we did that for most of it. If we'd been using the car constantly we could have parked in a two hour parking spot on a neighboring street--not on Wilshire Boulevard. Transit service is good there, with frequent buses along Wilshire Boulevard out to Beverly Hills and Santa Monica and in to Koreatown and Downtown, and good service on Fairfax Ave. (one long block away) as well. The hotel is across the street from a minimall with numerous restaurants--including pretty good Caffe Latte--but because we arrived at Christmastime they weren't open much.

The room itself was gorgeous and aside from some issues between our iPads and the WiFi, everything was great. The bed was very comfy, the television was good, the toiletries were nice and the bath was OUTSTANDING - we had a junior suite and the bathroom was incredible. We found the room to be very clean and well appointed. The one thing that was missing was a guest book with a list of amenities and room service menus - we searched everywhere and couldn't find one, but really needed one and it was sorely missed. Hopefully by now this has been rectified. Unfortunately we were on the 6th floor right next to elevator; this hotel used to be an office building so they've had to make some concessions to the original architecture, and one of those concessions is that guests who wish to visit the very nice and trendy rooftop bar have to get off the elevator on the 6th floor and then transfer to another elevator to up (and vice versa). Tipsy young folks who are having a great time do not keep their voices and giggles down while waiting for for elevators next to hotel rooms at 1am, even when the folks inside are trying to sleep, and the doors at the Hotel Wilshire are not well insulated. It was Friday night, and we had been to a concert and had a great time but we still wanted to sleep after a long week... we couldn't, though, and it ruined our night. This 6th-floor problem is one the hotel needs to address if they don't want to deal with angry guests every night. The restaurant was hit-or-miss, but it was early days so I will give them some time to work out the kinks... my British husband was miffed that they didn't know how to make tea properly, but his detailed notes for the staff hopefully were taken in and they're doing it a bit better by now.

First, all the employees look very unhappy. One housekeeper did smile when I greeted her on two occasions but then we leave a tip (to scale as recommended by the press) every single morning including on check out morning. The front desk is not friendly even when I am. We had a junior suite. It is decorated nicely (modern) but we found the infrastructure design really flawed. The ultra sleek bathroom has a rain shower (nice) with no shower curtain so the water splashes everywhere especially on their nice new bamboo wood floor. There's a soaking tub but the shower head that is installed does not remain directed at your body so it's not an option for a shower. The beautiful Roman shade in the bathroom has to stay all the way down because the large window is in full view of the office building and garage across the street. The living room area has an interesting look but the new upscale lighting is very dark even with all the lights on everywhere. The intro rates are reasonable but I would not stay here again because we did not feel at all welcome. When we checked out of the Trump Hotel everyone including the valet thanked us for staying with them. The Wilshire is a grumpy place. One big positive was the valet parking onsite - those guys were pleasant all the time.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding Hotel and Service!!!\u201d", "Author": "Tiffany r", "ReviewID": "UR119597392", "Content": "Absolutely the most enjoyable vacation I have have ever been on and I would owe a huge amount of that to the Hotel Wilshire and its team.
