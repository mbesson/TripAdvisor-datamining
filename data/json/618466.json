We stayed in this hotel (an excuse for a hotel) for a night in Sept 2006 and regret the day we booked it. We made the booking through Booking.com. We paid a hefty amount for what we thought would be a good 2 star hotel (considering the price we paid), but the hotel does not even merit a single star rating. The pictures on the booking site were deceptive. It was a good 20 minute walk from the main station. It is close to Galleria del Academia and Piazza Duomo. The entrance to the hotel is in tatters. The rooms are absolutely basic and the bare floors didn't even feel clean. The cots were creaky, the bed saggy and the pillows rock hard. The sheets and towels didn't seem clean. The shower was tiny and the shower door was broken. The soap case (attached to the wall) was dirty and broken. Our room faced the back and we couldn't keep the window open because the view was dirty and smelt bad.Breakfast was terrible. It consisted of cereals, milk, bread, jam, butter, juice, and tea/coffee. One carton of milk kept on the table seemed to have gone bad. The dining room is tiny and not clean. The attendants in the dining room didn't understand English at all and hence we failed to get our bread toasted and had to do with just tea and cereals. No eggs, ham, sausages, bacon etc.Overall, it was a nightmare and it was a relief to leave the hotel. Florence is a lovely place, unfortunately our stay there wasn't. It was so bad that it has made us very apprehensive of any hotel we book. Every time we go to a hotel, we wonder What if it turns out to be like the one in Florence?", "Date": "Oct 15, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR510918372", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "pkd100"}, {"Content": "economico ma.....   showReview(20787661, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR302044289", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mrbrightside80"}, {"Content": "en pleno centro de Florencia   showReview(19456986, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR398050707", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HawkPamplona"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d618466-r16422004-Hotel_San_Marco-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "618466", "Price": "$94"}}
