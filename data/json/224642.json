Upon check-in, I found the gentleman at the front desk was extremely nice and very welcoming. After completing the usual check-in, I was surprised when he handed me a paper and asked me to sign it explaining that they have no tolerance for disturbances. LOVED IT! I cannot tell you how many hotels I have stayed in that I was kept awake by doors slamming, people talking & yelling and kids running up & down the hallways at all hours of the night making noise. Every hotel should follow suit! Our room was clean, clean, clean! Never been disappointed yet with a Hampton Inn, however, this one was a step above. Our king bed was so comfortable that I did not want to leave in the morning. Seeing a soap dish in the bathroom made my day! It is one of my biggest pet peeves to stay somewhere and have the little bar of handsoap slide all over the vanity - yuck! Great water pressure in the shower too! The lobby & breakfast area are tastefully decorated with a retro-mod feel. Another nice touch here! Our breakfast ladies, Kathy & Brittany were superb! Our daughter has life threatening food allergies and both of these ladies went above & beyond to make sure she could safely eat some of the items on the hot breakfast portion. Both of these ladies exemplified service with a smile. I would not hesitate to stay here again and would definitely recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virgnia", "Title": "\u201cNice location!\u201d", "Author": "vak9girl74", "ReviewID": "UR116422497", "Content": "The hotel is in a great location - close to shopping, food and entertainment!

There are two flat screen TVs, one in the living area, one in the bedroom. The bed was very comfortable. Even the sleep sofa was comfortable. The wireless internet came in handy also. The hot breakfast was decent, even more so since it's included in the room cost. There is always hot fresh coffee in the lobby and fresh fruit, no cost. There is even a laundry available to guests, no cost. The staff was excellent!!! Very kind, thoughtful and helpful. We needed a cork screw, we called the front desk to ask if they had one. One was delivered and he even offered to show us how to use it or even open the bottle for us. They also quickly and with a smile delivered extra pillows. The location was very convenient. You can walk to The Avenue where there are shops and restaurants. Ikea is within walking distance. The mall is within walking distance, too, even though a little longer walk.... across the large mall parking lot. But the weather was excellent, so we chose to walk and enjoy the warmth and sunshine. It's convenient to the Beltway, 695, and to I-95. They are in the process of building a fire pit out back, near the pool. And they are presently doing some redecorating of the lobby area.

It was nice to get out of downtown Baltimore and back to this hotel in Whitemarsh. The inner harbor is nice but crowded and expensive to eat at a decent restaurant. There are so many choices around this hotel in Whitemarsh. Everytime we asked for directions around Camden Yards, we were to told that we would be safe if we stayed around this area, street, etc. After about the sixth time with that comment, it made us wonder what the area was like and why each person commented on safety. It didn't feel unsafe but it was nice to get back to the Hampton Inn. It was relaxing, and there were lots of options to do other things beside stay in one area because of safety concerns.

White Marsh is about a 20 minute drive to downtown Baltimore, but an easy one that is very accessible from all points of travel. The hotel is located across from a huge conglomeration of shops and malls- it has your typical mall with Macy's, etc., as well as a street known as \"The Avenue\" with various boutiques and eateries. Numerous restaurants and establishments (Bertuccis, Ballys Gym, Red Lobster) are scattered around the outskirts. A large Ikea is right there and Target and Wal-Mart as well. If you need something, from craft supplies to a fancy dress, you can find it right next door. The hotel even has a trolley (or shuttle van for larger groups) that will drive you to The Avenue whenever you want- and pick you up! Even though it's right across the street, it's nice to not worry about parking and to have the ability to all kick back and enjoy a cocktail or two! The hotel managers are great- even better are the women who serve up fabulous free (hot!) breakfasts every morning. There are the standard cereals and pastries and yogurts, but they have great build- your- own biscuits with eggs, sausage, and bacon which are perfect for filling up before a long day of traveling. If you are leaving early or can't make breakfast, the staff is more than happy to make a bag breakfast for you. On top of this, every evening they have warm gooey chocolate chip cookies available as well as coffee, tea and hot chocolate. The lobby/dining area is ample with a good television and they have a wonderful internet room where you can use the computer, printer, and various office supplies for FREE! Such a handy tool if you're traveling without your laptop. The rooms have the most gorgeous and plush white comforters and different thickness pillows (all labeled). The facility also has a very small workout room (try the free entry offered with your room to Ballys Fitness instead which is right next door!) There is also a small pool out back (only caveat- the beautiful trees sheltering the water have crazy fabric eating sap, so watch out!) My family never hesitates when deciding where to stay when coming up for a visit. The Hampton Inn at White Marsh is a no- brainer for people who want a hassle- free stay- be it a night stop on a long journey or a prolonged visit to the Baltimore region.
