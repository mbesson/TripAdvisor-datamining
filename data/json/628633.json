{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Pleasant. A safe bet. We were there in Feb '08 during the last leg of our maiden trip to Bali. The hotel had seen better days, but it wasn't shabby. Reliable if booked directly - truly enjoyed our competitively-priced pool-view room! Toilet wasn't cleaned properly though. Located quite a distance fr the hustle  bustle of Kuta in the relatively non-touristy area in Petitenget, no beach and limited restaurants within walking distance (nearest is Seminyak Beach), hotel restaurant food was OK, staff friendly (as with most Balinese), advisable to rent own transport if staying here, but the blue cab is pretty easy to call (the hotel can assist). Pleasant and a safe bet. Not for the wildly demanding tourists.", "Date": "May 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR605985470", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "AwesomeBlossome"}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u6b0d\u4eb1\u9287\u0441\u4eda\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19168883, 'full');", "Date": "Feb 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR603202777", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u6b0d\u4eb1\u9287\u0441\u4f04\u9288\u64b1\u4f0b\u9288\u5a3f\u4ef9\u9287\u5d83\u5020\u951b?#x201d;   showReview(19164452, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR140902686", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d628633-r16504148-Taman_Ayu_Cottage-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "628633", "Price": "$44"}}
