I will never forget my stay at The Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn. When we got to the hotel, I was greeted with smiling faces. The lady that checked me in (ANNA) upgrade my room to a suite when she found out that it was our Anniversary. My hubby and I had dinner arrangements so we needed a transportation to get to the restaurant. I called the front desk and spoke to Anna again and asked her if she could arrange a cab for us. She then offered to get me a private car and said it would cost me the same as a cab. When we got downstairs, I was in shocked when I found a stretched Limosine waiting for us, at first I was not sure of what to do, I did not want to pay that much to go to santa monica but she assured me that it was going to be the same price and that she just had to pull some strings (oh how i love her sense of humor) When we got back to the hotel, Anna had another surprise for us... We had a bottle of Champange waiting for us in the room with a \"Happy Anniversary\" balloon. Boy, I tell you, this was way better than the eve of my wedding.

We are staying currently in the hotel in the dreaded eldorado complex (RM 511) and the noise is unbearable, in fact it actually sounds like the windows are open the traffic noise is so bad. We are only here 2 more nights so we have held off from requesting a room change. We are also next to the lift! The rooms themselves are nice with decent decor and a basic but good shower, the TV selection is good and free wifi a nice touch. We are here on honeymoon and have been Hawaii, San Fran, and a cruise and even though the hotel are aware of our celebration they are the only hotel this trip who have not given us a card (the others even gave us a bottle of bubbly which was a lovely touch) I would recommend parking over the road in the quiet residential area as we did, although ensure you don't leave your car during road sweep like we did... $68 dollar fine! Beware each side has a different road sweep which we didn't realize. We had breakfast one morning which was nice if a little expensive. The location is superb for universal and the shuttle service excellent with pick ups and drop off all day until 9pm. In summary : Very noisy so do not stay in the eldorado building if you can help it. Parking expensive so use the street over the road. Nice rooms if a little basic but good TV/wifi", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cNoisey Older Hotel\u201d", "Author": "TracyCT", "ReviewID": "UR128675995", "Content": "Let me start off by saying I had a great time in Los Angeles! The only disappointment on my trip was this hotel. The Beverly Garland is so noisey from highway traffic. Many people mentioned that in their reviews, but I thought they might have been exaggerating. They weren't. I paid a few extra dollars to get a room with a pool view. I read on Tripadvisor that those rooms might be quieter, but sound of traffic was very loud in our room. The only way to drown out the traffic noise was to run the A.C which I started to do after two nights of poor sleep. My husband said that the glass must be very thin on the sliding doors in the room. The hotel was clean, but it had a cave-like feel to it. Another gripe I had was that I prepaid my room because Hoilday Inn advertises on their website that you can book with confidence that you are getting the lowest price. The price dropped on HI's website by $10 a night a few week after I booked. I had prepaid for 4 nights , so I figured it would be worth my wild to get an adjustment. When I called to try to get a price adjustment, they said that they only adjust the price if you find it lower within 24 hours of booking. I stay at Holiday Inns quite often on vacations, but I will not book with them any more because of their misleading advertising. Getting back to the Beverly Garland, their parking fee is ridiculous ($15 a night). One of the reasons that I booked the hotel was because the pool area looked pretty. The fireplace in the pool area was pretty at night, but we never sat by it because of the noise. During the day the pool area looked shady and the pavement around the pool usually looked wet. Every moring when we woke up and looked out at the pool fun noodles (I think that's what they're called) were floating in the pool. We were turned off and never even used the pool. The gift shop was small and expensive. Also there really isn't much within walking distance. Aside from apartments, Riteaid was the closest thing and they said that it was a 7 minute walk. Dining in the area seemed limited. We drove around several nights and were disappointed with the choice of restaurants. The girl working in the gift shop was very friendly and helpful and the shuttle driver to Universal was also friendly and helpful. I found the people at the front desk to be less friendly and heplful. If I ever go to that area gain I will look into staying at the Hilton or the other big hotel near Universal because they looked like better options. During our trip we spent another 3 nights at a Courtyard by Marriot in L.A. and paid much less for a modern, immaculate room, with a beautiful pool, and we were not charged for parking.

I felt that given the price we paid for the room, charging $15 a night for parking was outrageous. I am not against parking charges as we have paid them in hotels in Miami, London, Belfast etc. But this is not a city centre hotel and I feel $15 is way over the top! We parked over the road in a quiet residential street, the extra couple of minutes walk was worth it. We did not use the restaurant as luckily, we met a couple who strongly advised us against it.

We had a patio off our room overlooking the pine trees -very nice. We didn't use the pool, but noticed other people enjoying it. (not crowded) The hotel guests were diverse - business travelers, families, even saw some college students on Spring Break. In the back of the resort, there was a grassy area with a playground - wonderful activity for our kids after a long car trip. There were tennis courts on-site. The best part of this hotel was its FREE shuttle to Universal Studios. It was a 5-minute drive each way and the ride was Door-to-Door. Couldn't get much easier. The hotel parking lot was very large and plentiful. Our rate allowed us to get free parking. The area was nice and I didn't have any worries about security. We purchased dessert from the adjoining restaurant \"Tula's\", but would pass on this next time. Nothing special. However, the breakfast buffet was very good. Would not hesitate to stay here again.

I wasn't keen on where the safes were, they were in a seperate room near reception. There was a shuttle that ran to Univeral Studios which was free. The staff at reception and in the gift shop were very helpful. One of the days during my stay it was raining and the lady in the gift shop gave me an address to a mall down the road that was undercover and free to park. I would think twice before hiring a car as parking in the hotel and at muesums etc was very exspenive, went to the farmers market and the maximum for parking there was $25 but you can park for 2 hours free with a validated ticket, which you had to purchase something from shops to get your ticket validated, so it wasn't free. Be aware that you need quarters to park at the side of roads around Hollywood Blvd, so ensure that you have plenty as my friend went into the shop on the corner for quarters and gave the man $5 and it was willing to give $2 for the $5.

The Air con unit sounded like a washing machine and kept us awake half the night. The third flaw was the internet connection. The wireless internet was poor, giving intermittent service at best and was dreadfully slow. We complained to the front desk who told us to call customer services for the internet provider, we asked the hotel staff to call as this was not our issue but a hotel problem, however they insisted we call and gave us the number. We waited half and hour on the phone and got no reply and eventually gave up. The next day we complained to the front desk staff again and were told that the internet was slow due to the number of people using the service (we tried using the internet at 3am to check the status of our flight and it was still the same!) The fourth flaw was customer service. We asked twice for the hotel to book us a taxi to be told that there were already two outside the building. When we made our way to the lobby there were no taxis and we asked again if a taxi could be booked. We waited another 20 minutes before a taxi arrived.

No liquor until 4:30. :-( We could hear the highway noise, but got used to it after the first night; however, it was very loud with the patio door open.The pool area was really nice and I'm assuming it was heated because we often saw people swimming day and night. We had one of the best hamburgers and chicken sandwiches we've ever eaten at the hotel's restaurant!

Conveniently located close to Universal Studios and the freeways, you do get a bit of traffic noise if you're put in the wrong rooms. And yet again, I would say, we love it here! Staff are friendly and helpful. If you go out of season you often get the pool area to yourself (and they don't observe stupid EU 'elf and safety rules on keeping the children out of the jaccuzzi) and they also turn a blind eye to you taking your own drinks to have by the pool as the poolside bar is closed.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey Shore", "Title": "\u201cPerfect location\u201d", "Author": "BarbaraOnTheGo", "ReviewID": "UR122576180", "Content": "I recently stayed at this hotel with my sister-in-law on vacation.

I stayed 1 night in a standard room. I was originally allocated a room on the fifth floor. This room had a delightful view of the freeway. However, more disturbingly the sliding glass door on the balcony would not close in this room. The room was therefore very loud and smelled of car fumes. After complaining, I was allocated a room on the second floor. Like a punch in the face, the second room smelled of cigarette smoke. It was, however, marginally more quiet than the old room so I settled for the better of the two evils. However, the noise was still loud enough to make it difficult to sleep. The beds were comfortable but the hotel in general was poorly maintained and the decor was extremely outdated. The furniture was old and tarnished. The room was very unclean. The carpets were stained, there was pubic hair all over the bathroom floor and the bath/shower drain was blocked causing the bath tub to fill up when the shower was turned on. The bathroom tiles were cracked and required an overhaul.

After reading the positive reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to book my stay here. I was not disappointed. My stay was perfect. I arrived about 3:00 p.m., and my check-in was very smooth. My room was very clean and spacious, and a haven to return to after busy days of sightseeing. The bed was extremely comfortable, and I always got a good night's sleep. Although the weather was a bit too cool for me to use the pool, it was so inviting, and the restaurant, Tula's, was very good. The hotel staff at the front desk were always very friendly and helpful, as were Terri, Barbara and Maria in the gift shop. There were safety deposit boxes available, as well as two computers for use in the business center and free WiFi throughout the hotel. I was taking the red eye home on my last day, and my luggage was safely stowed through the day so I could take advantage of all my last day exploring. As a single woman traveler, safety, comfort, and ease for getting to and from the sights of LA were very important to me. I felt very safe at this hotel, it was very comfortable, and unlike many reviews written before, I found that the location was great for getting to the sights. The hotel provides a free shuttle to and from Universal Studios and the Metro station, which are just a short drive down the road. The bus (#156) to the center of Hollywood (Hollywood and Highland) stops right across the street from the hotel, and returns to doorstep of the hotel. The concierge will provide you with the schedule both to and from town. I used this bus a great deal, and could not have asked for more. The ride is about 20 minutes and very few stops were made along the way. To me the ride did not seem overly long for public transportation. What a delight to get off the bus at the Kodak Center (right in the hub of the Hollywood attractions). My very first view was of the HOLLYWOOD sign from the Kodak Center! To be dropped at the door of the hotel on the return trip, especially when returning after dark, was such a positive! I used the hotel shuttle to go to the Metro to get to downtown LA to visit Olvera Street and the Los Angeles Historical district. It is a direct route on the red line to the last stop at Union Station. This line also stops at Hollywood & Highland, Hollywood & Vine, and a near the theaters in downtown LA. There is a free tour of the historic district that leaves from the office next to the fire station. Once downtown, the DASH bus is also available to visit the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Staples Center, Little Tokyo, etc. Fare for the buses and the Metro is $1.50 one way or an all day $5.00 pass. I didn't use public transportation to go to the other places I visited, but am sure that with a bit of work, it was doable. One review stated how long it had taken using public transportation to get to Long Beach and Santa Monica. I rented a car for a day to go to the Getty Museum (definitely go here), Long Beach and Santa Monica (the pier at night is beautiful). The car rental price was reasonable, and great to be on my own schedule. Even with a car, the trip to Long Beach was about an hour and a half one way (although I did take a few wrong turns even with a GPS), so I figure 2 1/2 hours on a bus that another review stated it took, is probably par for the course. If you have a car and have the time, take Multiview Drive in Hollywood Hills (Muholland Drive) for bird's eye views of Universal City, the Hollywood Bowl, the Hollywood sign and downtown LA from the Scenic Overlooks. The Drive starts just a short distance from the hotel and winds up into the hills. I really enjoyed this short excursion. For my other exploring, I booked the Citysights LA Hop On, Hop Off bus - poor choice! I wish I had paid more attention to Krisrose's Trip Advisor review dated 9/11/2011 about this company - ditto to everything she stated!!! My booking did however include a Movie Stars Homes and Beverly Hills tour which I enjoyed. The hotel had recommended Starline Tours - perhaps this was the way to go. On my last day I visited Madame Tussaud's. The wax figures are incredible, and the museum is very interactive. It was so much fun! The hotel offered 2 days for 1 at Universal Studios (also available on-line). If you don't have or don't want to spend 2 days at Universal, you can purchase your Universal tickets at Madame Tussaud's and get entrance to the wax museum for free. For me, this was a great deal. I am a planner, and since I don't want to waste one minute while traveling, I like to have a good grasp of what I am doing and how to get there before I leave home. As stated in many reviews, LA is very spread out, and so planning was definitely much more challenging. Exploring LA in sections: Hollywood, Universal City area, Beverly Hills, Downtown LA, the beaches, etc. is the best way to go. Knowing how much time is needed for each attraction is also helpful in being realistic about how much you can not only see, but also, enjoy. I definitely recommend the Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn.

We were aware of this from previous Tripadvisor postings and therefore 3 months before our stay asked for a quiet room.

There are a few big red bus tour companies and unfortunately we picked the one that no one knew what time the buses picked up, there was no signage at pickup points or timetables and we got different information from each person we spoke to. The speakers did not work upstairs and they were using loud hailers which no one could hear what they were saying, we waited over 90 minutes at one stop and then nearly an hour at another stop and we were with other passengers waiting as well so we all got told incorrect information. There were different tour directors for different legs of the trip and because we had to redo tour routes to get to different locations - each tour director on each leg of the trip expected a tip for re- telling us the same information that we had heard previously. Finally we were coming back late one afternoon from Venice Beach and had to change buses at Rodeo drive (another tour director again) and it was quite cold and there were no seats installed downstairs at all so we had to freeze on the top deck and listen for the third time to the same tour description.

The reception staff were not overly friendly but neither were they rude in any way. We had a ground floor room in the El Dorado section which was close to the hotel amenities but could get loud being close to the function room. Light sleepers would not like the noise from the air conditioner at ground level right next to the bed. The room was a good size, the king size bed very comfortable. The hotel has the convenience of the shuttle service which is good for visiting the area it services such as Universal Studios but if you want to go anywhere else and don't have a car as we didn't it is a bit far from the action. We got ripped off on one cab ride back to hotel but that was no fault of the hotel. As a result of the location we spent a bit of time in the hotel restaurant and bar. The restaurant meals were large and good value as was the room service. The restaurant staff were probably the most friendly we encountered at the hotel apart from the lady in the gift shop who was excellent in arranging a tour. The bar staff appeared as though they would have rather be somewhere else. One of the better features is the free internet in the business centre.

Arrival and checkin relatively smooth however receptionist missed that parking was included which was simply careless. Very comfortable bed but fierce aircon sitiuated right next to it. Following morning found a large number of dead and dying flies in the bathroom...very unpleasent but hotel took t seriously and dealt with it quickly. They offered and upgrade which we declined as it was a a kids suite and in any event we did not have time to repack and unpack. Breakfast was at alst a buffett in a Holiday inn and worked well but again the rubbish kids menu that is standard fayre in HI was given to the kids.. Rate included tour of Hollywood but we had to pay extra for the two kids. Wished we had not as the tour was terrible with a driver who simply talked about anything and nothing for over 5 hours. Day 2 breakfast was a disaster. Hotel had closed restaraunt but did not tell us. A conference room was used and at 8.30 it was chaotic. The staff were inundated with guests, there was no food and no plates or anything else for that matter. By 8.50 managers arrived and started clearing tables and finally food arrived. I cannot begin to tell you how bad it was. Had to be on 9.30am bus to Universal so cut breakfast short and waited for bus. It arrived 9.45 and we were left behind with all seats taken by those with sharp elbows and a desire to push. As a result I complained to the duty manager in private but very firmly and left him in no doubt of how I felt. Given I was paying close to $400 a night I expected and required far better than this. It was left that the hotel should make somesort of gesture to make up for flies breakfast and buses. Great day at Universal and we left the next morning following an uneventful breakfast. Noted that the bill had been adjusted by $200 which I thought generous and refelcetd that the hotel is trying and takes things seriously.

Room was good with the big flat screen, free wifi, LOTS of plugs to charge stuff in, neutral colors, nice bedding etc. Bathrooms are still circa 1970's but they were clean. Public spaces are very attractive with lounges and a firepit. The fitness center is better than average for a hotel as well. The free shuttle to Universal is a good deal, but I didn't really need it. The not so good: The freeway noise. It's really loud. At times it can drown out the TV in the room. Every room has a little balcony, but there is no way to enjoy it with the loud noise. Make sure you ask for a room that does not face the freeway. Also, $14 for parking? Really? In the middle of suburban North Hollywood? That's just greedy for this area. The menu in the restaurants is fine, ate there a couple of times and service was hit or miss. Even though the place is always empty, sometimes the waiter just dissapeared. The food is priced very reasonably and not too bad. Front desk service is at best courteous, nothing to write home about. The both times I stayed here because I got a good rate and could not imagine paying more than $100 to stay here.

We bought the accommodation via that website Priceline.com, and that gave the receptionists the right to think we're not worth being treated with courtesy and good manners. When my husband approached the reception to check in, he literally heard \" WHAT DO YOU WANT?\" , hotel was empty but we were given a horrible room, first floor facing the noisy freeway, so uncalled for! We paid for full breakfast in advance, the receptionist never gave us the BF vouchers, he simply assumed we weren't entitled to it and never bothered to even ask, confirm or let alone apologise after we were refused to eat and had to chase whoever could finally confirm we had pre-paid for breakfast.... this is all making our Universal Studios fun day start very late. Restaurant /Breakfast staff also stink like tobacco, it all added up to an expensive stay that was not worthy at all.

The hotel is very close to Universal and, since it's literally right off the freeway, is convenient to almost everything. The room met our needs. It is a converted double room, with a \"fort\" in place of one of the queen beds. The kids thought that having their own little \"room\" was cool. In it were bunk beds, a TV, and a bookcase containing a video game system and some shelves with baskets for clothing. Parents, keep in mind that what I've been calling a fort does not have its own door, and the kid on the top bunk can actually look over the top of the fort (if they try) to see your bed, but it did provide a nice divider between the kids and the queen bed. The Kid Suite does come with a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. We found the room clean enough. What we liked about the hotel beside the Kid Suite were the free shuttle to Universal Studios, the pool (particularly the \"Dive In\" movies shown poolside Thurs-Sat nights), and the restaurant (free meals for kids). The hotel has a fitness center but no spa; however you can arrange to have an in-room massage by Tamera. A few things mentioned in previous reviews were true: the sleeper closest to the AC will be freezing, there was no fan in the bathroom, and you really can't go out on the terrace without hearing the freeway, but these issues were manageable. If you kept the terrace door closed you really couldn't hear the noise. My only other comment was that there were not enough shuttles coming back from Universal in the evening. The 8:15 PM shuttle filled up and the driver had to make TWO more trips to pick everyone up. I would recommend either a bigger shuttle or additional evening pickups. Other than that, we found the Beverly Garland a good place for families to stay while in North Hollywood.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cNo mini fridge\u201d", "Author": "princesspea01", "ReviewID": "UR78049646", "Content": "There is no mini fridge in the room which we missed.

The hotel is right next to freeway 101 which makes access really easy, but does mean there is constant traffic noise 24x7. Although our room double glazing was good and kept most of the noise out, it does mean you can\u2019t really sit on the room balcony as it is too noisy The petty things that really spoilt our stay here are:- 1) There is no fridge in the room. You can hire one on a first come first served basis for $10 a day. This seems really petty. I think every other hotel room I have stayed in in the US has had a fridge and many of those hotels were of a lesser category (and cost) than this one. 2) We booked our room for 4 people through hotels.com. The booking said \"Full breakfast\". But the hotel would not honour this booking condition and would only give complimentary breakfast to 2 people in each room which I thought was quite extraordinary. I have never stayed anywhere that offered free breakfast to only half of a room's occupants. We questioned this with the management but they wouldn\u2019t alter that position.

Parking was $14, but the front desk offered to register me in their points club for free which knocked down the price to $11/night. Wifi was free and worked pretty well. Our major issue with the hotel was the AC unit. We had a two bed room and they place the AC unit literally 16 inches away from one of the beds with the cold air blowing right into your face. For that reason we couldn't turn on the AC at night, but if we left it off we were able to hear the TV in other rooms.

The location of the hotel is good if you have a car as you can travel on the freeway to your destination. If you don't have a car then there are limited eating options. There is a small shopping center at the top of Vineland where we went to a supermarket called Ralphs and had a sandwich - which I can recommend as well as an evening meal at a Chinese called City Wok.

No free breakfast, no coffee in the lobby, very few suites available (which really helps when traveling with a teenager who needs his space), loud freeway noise unless you request to change rooms to the tennis court side or patio side of the hotel. The laundry room has one washer and one dryer and was dirty. They don't even replace the shampoo and other toiletry items when you stay more than one night. I had to run down the maid to get another shampoo because we'd used all of ours. Of course, hotels in this area are going to be expensive and noisy (it is a very crowded city!), but still, I found a lot of things lacking at this hotel. We'd just stayed at a Homewood Suites in San Diego that gave us free breakfast, free dinner (Mon. through Thurs.), free coffee all day, little extras that make you feel more welcome.

It's retro, 1950s and 60s, but clean and well-kept. The grounds communicate rest and relaxation even though the hotel is near the hum of a major highway. The hotel is apparently still owned by the family of the late Beverly Garland, which gives it a genuine Hollywood connection. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is pricey ($18+) but first-rate (and kids eat free). On the downside, you pay for parking, and service at the front desk can be SLOW (even if there isn't a line). One more thing: Beware of the special offers on the hotel's website. They may not be what they seem! Thinking of returning to the hotel with my family, I recently booked a Best-4-Breakfast rate that the website claimed was bundled with their breakfast buffet. But after I actually confirmed the reservation, I noticed small print on the confirmation page saying that actually each room gets one coupon worth $20. If you are staying there alone, that is just barely enough to pay for the breakfast buffet plus tax. But if you have your spouse with you, this coupon isn't going to provide a breakfast buffet for both people in the room. I just confirmed this by calling the reservation line. I consider the hotel's description of this rate is HIGHLY misleading. In my experience, \"Breakfast\" rates typically mean breakfast for everyone in the room, or at least for two people in double-occupancy rooms--not breakfast for only one person. The reservation person said she would communicate my concern to management. It will be interesting to see if the hotel corrects its website. Since this \"breakfast\" rate does not actually include breakfast for more than one person, the \"savings\" of this rate is non-existent. You will save more money by ordering a single room and then ordering breakfast separately, especially if you are a member of a group like AAA that gets a room discount.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Essex", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel close to Universal Studios\u201d", "Author": "DeeLittleHobo", "ReviewID": "UR65749459", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in May as part of a multi-city vacation in California and Nevada. We chose the Beverly Garland based on other reviews and were not disappointed. The hotel is situated in North Hollywood, close to Universal Studios which is only a 5 minute drive away. The hotel has a minivan which takes guests and picks them up from Universal Studios; this service is free and we used it without any problems. The staff we encountered were all very nice and helpful including LaTanya who works in the gift shop and the waiter in the restaurant (I think his name was Milo?). The rooms are comfortable and clean with good quality linens and towels. There was no in-room safe but it is possible to \"hire\" a safe in the business centre by the hotel lobby. Basically you pay a deposit for the safe key (I believe this was $25) and get it back when you return the key at the end of your stay. There is free wi-fi in the room (you need to ask the staff for an access code). There is a good sized pool and hot tub plus a sauna and a gym. The pool area is really nice and there is even a fireplace which is especially handy when you have a dip after dark and you feeling a little bit chilly after getting out of the water. The pool area is open till 10pm. There is also a laundy room on the lower ground floor of one of the buildings with a coin operated washer and dryer. You will need quarters for these, about $1.25 for the wash and $1 for the dryer (or vice versa - cannot remember). It costs $14 a day to park in this hotel. I believe this is the norm with many Los Angeles hotels especially ones near tourist attractions. We enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would recommend it without hesitation. My one word of advice is to ask for a room that does not face the freeway (if you are a light sleeper). The first room we were offered faced the freeway and I knew straight away that this would not work for me. We went down to lobby again and asked for a room change, which they did graciously and without any hassle.

That was also annoying as the kids suite costs quite a bit more than the standard room and it is in the noisiest part of the hotel. The kids suite really just has a little wall around bunk beds, my son liked it though, he thought it was fun. It costs you however to use the games in the room.

When we checked in, I mentioned that the reason for the trip was to celebrate my hubby's recent 40th birthday, and we received an immediate room upgrade. We also weren't charged for parking for our entire 4 day stay, but to be honest, I'm not sure if his birthday was the reason for that... during the massive storms in L.A that started half way through our trip, the power went out in the hotel one day (not for very long), so perhaps we received free parking because of that inconvience... but regardless, it was a $14 per day savings, so we weren't asking questions! The pool was open and very well heated, and the surroundings were lovely.. well treed. The rooms were spotless. The only \"negative\" I noticed others pointed out was that the rooms don't have in room safe's but we had no issue with this, we simply locked our belongings in our suitcase.

The \"room\" looked like a fort or a castle. How perfect for little boys/kids? I thought the \"Guest of the Day\" promotion idea is absolutely fantastic as a way to promote guest-loyalty! The room was clean, the bathroom was clean, the employees were very helpful. the decor was very contemporary. My only \"minor\" complaint was that our room was located on the first floor, and at about midnight or so, employees on a shift change or break, were being loud outside our room. Not a big deal.

Generally ok but this has to be the worst experience. At first glance this seemed ok.

We even had free parking. Staff were ok; and actually the hotel is in an ok location. We missed the shuttle to Universal City and ended up going most places by car as it's conveniently located just off the highway. Downtown LA isn't far at all. On the first night we had a bad experience though. I was woken up gone 4am by the sound of a hotel door closing. At first thought it was another room in the coridoor then thought it was too loud and I checked the door to my own room. To my horror, I found that the door had been opened but the only thing stopping anyone coming through into the room was that the security latch was on - I could see that it had been pushed in. I phoned the reception straightaway as I had a child in the room and told them that someone had tried to access my room, thinking that perhaps they had issued someone a keycard for the same room in error. They rang back to say it was probably security doing their checks. Left it til the next morning to follow up but we were extremely unhappy and couldn't get back to sleep that night with worry. They sent someone up the next morning to check who had accessed the room by reading the card reader. It turns out it WAS security who had tried to check the room as 'routine' part of their checks during the night. The reception maintained this was legitimate normal practice and that the room had accidentally been checked out of their systems so it showed the room was empty. It can't be right that a member of staff walks around accessing rooms in the middle of the night. We had locked the door and put the security latch on, but imagine if we hadn't and someone had openly walked into our room during the middle of the night! We felt this was an unsatisfactory answer and escalated the complaint to the general manager. The receptionist we spoke to later was apologetic and offered us a complimentary dinner or breakfast which we tried to take up but when we did the assistant manager tried to rescind the offer of dinner. We settled for breakfast in the end but felt as though the hotel didn't take our complaint seriously.

I took the time and read the reviews regarding the hotel and took everything in. Some people stated on the reviews that the food was horrible and that the area wasn't safe. Here is an honest review that I hope helps everyone from a frequent hotel traveler. The hotel is outdated and is in need of a few face lifts including new carpeting in the hallways. The hallways could also use a bit more lighting but it isn't scary. The room was clean and came with a coffee maker, hairdryer, tons of towels (we had 4 adults in our room) and an iroining board etc. Our room was kept clean and we never had a problem. We stayed in the Eldorado building which if sitting outside on the small balcony (large enough for two people to sit) the sound of the freeway is noticeable. BUT, once you are inside the room with the airconditioning on, you can't even hear it. Our group didn't have any problem sleeping. When we arrived we were asked about taking tours and we simply said that we were there for business so we didn't have time-we weren't asked again and I never felt pressured or pushed to attend a tour. We took advantage of the coffee shop and I experienced an \"okay\" chai latte, but not a big deal. We had the breakfast buffet in the morning which costs $11.95. I personally felt that this was a bit steep considering what was offered and felt that if it was around $7.95 that would be better-but the food was good. The eggs were egg beaters but it wasn't terrible. The area surrounding the hotel is safe. We attended an event about three blocks up and was able to walk back to the hotel at 11:00pm without an issue. The only issue that I had was that we had to pay for parking. Now, I was only charged $11.00 a day vs the $13.00 I am hearing but I still think that this is ridiculous since I was staying at their hotel and already giving them money via the hotel room. This wouldn't make me not stay there again, but I would look for a place that maybe didn't charge as much. The location is not far from Universal Studios and there is a shuttle that is offered by the hotel to get you there. The shuttle does not pick up at the airport-please keep that in mind when making plans.

Location: The location of the Beverly Garland is good\u2013just off the freeway with easy access to Disney (took us about an hour but the traffic is crazy). There are a number of Hollywood/LA tours you can book right at the hotel. The bus stops at the hotel to pick you up and you really don\u2019t have to travel far. The shuttle to Universal is great BUT when you\u2019re returning home at night remember that a ton of other guests will be returning as well and there may not be room for you (which means you wait for the next shuttle). FYI: spend the extra $$$ and take the VIP Tour at Universal. Great value for money and if you don\u2019t book it you will probably spend your day hating those (and yourself) with the VIP cards who go right past you in line and who get to get off their trams and explore the sets while you sit on your tram and simply drive by. While at the Beverly we spent a day at Universal, a day touring Hollywood and a day at Santa Monica Beach (not a bad drive at all considering it is LA). Rooms: No fridge but otherwise fine. Nice, simple accommodation. You probably don\u2019t want a room on the ground floor since these rooms are actually \u2018downstairs\u2019 and really only have a view of the hill they\u2019re built into. We started out on the second floor and had sewage back up in the tub (gross, but they moved us immediately, no problem) and ended up on the first floor right near the pool. Very convenient. There is laundry in one of the buildings. Pool: Small but nice. Always loads of loungers. Snack bar and towels. There\u2019s a hot tub and sauna too but we didn\u2019t use these. Food: I liked Tula\u2019s. The menu had loads of variety and the prices were reasonable. Concerns: My concerns are not so much about the hotel but have more to do with the fact that I booked this hotel because of its review in Frommer\u2019s. Frommer\u2019s stated that kids under 12 eat free. That didn\u2019t happen for us and I\u2019m not sure why\u2013I was just told that we didn\u2019t have that package. Maybe Frommer\u2019s should indicate you have to buy a special package to get this. Also, Frommer\u2019s indicated Free Parking. That also did not happen\u2013we paid $13 a day I believe. Minor things, I know, but these were two reasons I booked here so I was annoyed. This is a very pleasant family hotel and a good location from which to sightsee.

They seemed to be busy and we checked with the Front Desk to see if a room was available - the clerk that happened to serve us was clearly frustrated and overwhelmed and unfortunately a bit curt to us.

To start with the down sides, its right next to the busy 101 freeway although the traffic noise doesn't bother me. The parking is not cheap at $13 currently, but is secure nonetheless. I also found that the on site restaurant was quite expensive considering that the hotel offers no complimentary breakfast. If you don't like what is on offer it is a fair walk to get something elsewhere. There is a shopping area including a Ralph's store about 15 mins walk form the hotel. The hotel is very easy to get to from the freeway, it is virtually just off the Vineland Ave ramp. Contrary to some other reviews I found the area surrounding the hotel to be quite a nice neighbourhood and would have no problem walking around day or night. The hotel is large and in separate sections. The decor is quite old fashioned but I quite like that. The lobby is quite small and in an L shape. There are pictures on the wall from the old days. The staff are well dressed and courteous. The outside spaces & gardens are well kept. The are tennis courts but I did not use these. There are big pine trees which rise close to the buildings, you can touch them from the balcony. Maybe they are meant to block out traffic noise, not sure if they do but they look nice anyhow. The rooms are pretty average. on both occasions I have found the rooms & bathrooms to be clean & tidy. I don't remember there being a coffee maker in the room, but everything else you would expect. I didn't have any problems with rowdy guests. When I have stayed here most guests have been middle aged upward so I guess people in this age group tend to behave themselves.

Here's my thoughts... Location- Near freeway, but we were not bothered by the traffic noise at all. Extremely close to Universal Studios- Great complimentary hotel shuttle to the studios. North Hollywood is a beautifully clean area, that is a lot safer than other parts of LA. Service- Very professional. Everything was slick and polished! Friendly front desk and doormen. Amenities- We did not end up trying the pool, sauna or tennis courts, but they looked good! There is also a gift shop on site which comes in handy. Tourist info- You can book tours and get area info from the gift shop on site. Food- The hotel has a on site restaurant/cafe which has excellent food and very friendly and eager to please staff. They are very good with handling children too... There was also a splash bar on the property. A 5-10minute walk down the road to supermarket and some takeaway shops. Room- Regular size. Nice beds. Good maid service. Advice- If you're planning on playing on the tennis courts you must be wearing proper tennis shoes, otherwise you will not be allowed on. The laundry room is a bit hard to find, so ask for specific directions. Most tour companies will pick you up from this hotel. The front desk is always busy, so try using their quick check out.

Actually, ALL the staff were extremely friendly AND professional! Tula's restaurant onsite has excellent food and value. I had a breakfast and lunches at Hilton and Sheraton during mtgs and there is no comparison to Tula's yummy factor, service, portion and price.

Re location: it's a pleasant 10 minute WALK to supermarket, chinese restaurant, starbucks and I felt very safe. I went for a dessert and coffee walk after late meeting at 1030pm and it's indeed an okay neighborhood to walk. Stayed 3 more nights a week later in August in a different wing and here's my take on the rooms, both times on the 5th (nonsmoking) floor: 1. Bldg on the far left behind lobby is where I stayed for first 5 nights. Bathtup didn't work for baths so had to shower but all else was great--room size, comfy king bed and pillow choices, quiet location (facing garden/lobby). Probably due for remodel/update in future. 2. August stay I was 2 bldgs behind the swimming pool/sauna area overlooking parking lot. Think it might be much more quieter and private than first bldg. This room was larger and nicely upgraded and seemed more like rooms I get when on corporate business account. Example of staff service, efficiency and personableness: I was stranded waiting for a cab company that kept saying \"it'll be 15 minutes\" and an hour and 4 phone calls later I was still waiting in the sweltering afternoon heat. At my wits end I called the hotel and Robin at the front desk expertly handled panicked guest (me), figured out where I was, called the cab company they usually use, had me wait in a specific area and a cab arrived 10 minutes later. During the 10 minute wait she called bacl to make sure I was where instructed to be and asked that I please let the front desk know when I got in so they knew I was okay and back at property.

It seemed like a good idea and we eventually made it work for us with some mishaps and adjustments. This suite is for KIDS, toddlers only if you are forewarned. Basically, these are baby proofing issues that are not the norm for older kids. As always with toddlers, lots and lots of supervision is necessary. Most hotel cribs are too small for a toddler so she would have ended up sleeping with us in a normal room (hence the king). We ended up having to go out to buy a safety rail so she could sleep in the lower twin. Once the safety rail was in place, everthing was fine. The reading lights attached to the wall for the bunk beds get very hot, and curious 2 year olds can burn their fingers. I ended up unplugging the whole contraption. You HAVE to put the latch over the door, because even \"locked\", they can get out and they are off. Then, if the latch is on and they try to open the door they could get their hand/fingers caught if the door closes. Ah, yes and the bunkbeds. On day 3, she discovered the ladder...it is NOT detachable. Now for the plusses. Yes, there are quite a few. The queen bed was very comfortable. Being able to put our daughter to bed in a separate area of the room and still read or watch tv was a real treat after other hotel stays. The restaurant food and service were very nice and other than the usual hassle of dining with a toddler, we enjoyed ourselves. The staff was very helpful, friendly, polite, etc. We got plenty of clean towels, the hotel was clean and attractive, the grounds were pleasant and attractive.

The terrace outside our room was on the highway side of hotel. The road noise was unbelievable. I only opened the doors once. That was enough. Fortunately, the terrace doors are sound proofed, I think. The terrace would have been nice otherwise (except I'm sure my daughter would have tried to climb the railings and I would have had to close them anyway). The \"splash\" pool adjacent to the regular pool was the perfect depth for our daughter. She was able to stand with the water chest high and after getting more familiar with it, enjoyed herself tremendously several times during our stay. Of course, most of the time I was in there with her, the rest of the time, I sat on the edge with my feet in. The diameter was about the size of a small hot tub.

The three of us loved the hotel, the room faced the tennis courts and was very quiet, we saved parking money using the shuttle provided by the hotel for Universal Studios, my niece ate free, and the staff was so friendly we really hated for our three day stay to end. My niece keeps asking to go back to Hollywood and stay at the hotel, and I am planning a return trip this summer.", "Date": "April 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "PARIS, TENNESSEE", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel.

There is free scheduled shuttle daily that takes you to universal and picks you up, as well. There is a small gift shop right inside the lobby that sells shirts, souvenirs, postcards, and even stamps to mail your postcards. They also have maps and brochures of nearby attractions and also you can buy tour tickets right here in the lobby. Any additional items you may need may also be purchased at the gift shop (tampons, cigarettes, etc.) The restaurant on-site serves wonderful food at decent prices. We had breakfast there, it was wonderful!! The price is $11.95 per person and that includes your OJ or whatever drink you prefer. The buffet consists of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, biscuits, and several other breads, fresh fruit, and even cereal!! It was well worth the price. Also, they have a great dinner menu. I got pot roast it was about $10.00 and came with carrots and mashed potatoes. We also bought a fruit cup to go it was $2.99 and had cantaloupe, pineapples, strawberries, and grapes in it\u2014yummie!! The room are great and clean. Housekeeping always had it looking great when we came back from our long day out in Hollywood. The rooms all have balconies with 2 chairs outside. The rooms have coffee makers, irons, and hairdryers. The television is neat. It has nin64 games you can purchase time on. There is also pay-per-view movies and internet on you tv screen. There is a nice heated pool, and a kiddie pool. There is also a sauna in the pool area. You have to use your hotel key to get in-so don\u2019t forget your key!! In the lobby, as you walk in, there is a couple of love seats right beside a flaming fireplace where you can sit and await your tour bus to pick you up. i highly recommend this hotel!! Please email me if you have any questions for me.", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conway, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cGarland's was Great - for the Price\u201d", "Author": "SuePete", "ReviewID": "UR4594150", "Content": "We stayed at Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn for 4 nights in early March of '06 as part of a Southwest tour package (4 nights hotel and air from Little Rock was about $700 for two - what a deal!). We chose this site because we wanted to \"Do Hollywood\" and Universal. The Hotel is about 24 miles from LAX, right at Vineland exit, and good driving directions are given on the site (note to hotel: it would be more helpful to have approximate driving distances included for each stretch). Glad we made the drive late at night - those 12 lane highways can be quite intimidating. The property is beautifully landscaped - nice pool, but weather was cold and rainy while we were there so we didn't use it. Yes, the noise of the freeway was constant (I actually thought our balcony door was open when we entered our room), but we just cranked up the heater (yes, heater), which helped. Bed was comfortable and room was clean. We were rarely in the room during the day, and were so exhaused at night after doing Universal, Price is Right, a CBS Studio filming of \"According to Jim\" and Ashes and Snow exhibit (wonderful) at Santa Monica Pier (it's there only through May) that we simply collapsed at night. A free shuttle is provided to Universal. We used it and it was right on time. Also, ate breakfast at the restaurant there one morning - excellent garden omelette - huge portions. Buffet breakfast looked great, also (about $12 including drinks). Free USA Today, free in-room coffee-maker, but NO refrigerator). Our last night three guys manning the desk were rude when I asked for a quiet restaurant dining recommendation, but I blame this more on their young age, ignorance, and desire to \"show off\" for each other (\"Duh - like McDonalds?\"). Turns out we found a great restaurant nearby on our own - Zack's - turn left on Ventura and it's a few blocks down on right. Nothing fancy, it was QUIET, inexpensive, and had great food (Hazelnut chicken and salmon, two glasses of wine - under $50). Wish we had found it sooner.", "Date": "March 8, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Beverly Garland's Holiday Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d78682-Reviews-Beverly_Garland_s_Holiday_Inn-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$163 - $241*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">4222 Vineland Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">91602</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516013", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/99/7a/997a848d0387ff6d720d42025309545b6large.jpg"}}
