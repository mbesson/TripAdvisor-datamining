Overall, it was absolutely fine, though for those more familiar with American or British star ratings, this is more a 3 star hotel by those standards. For example, the pool on the roof is fine to get wet and cool down in, but not big enough to swim much. This was my first visit to Istanbul, with my flight arriving well after midnight. With public transport having closed down by then, I asked the hotel to arrange a shuttle to collect me (for 20 Euro) so that was very helpful and worked OK. My room on the 6th floor was fine, with a good sized bathroom and definitely more bedroom space than the average London tourist hotel. One very nice touch was a wrapped plate of fruit waiting for my arrival. The breakfast buffet was OK, with mostly cold meats, cheese, bread, fruit and salad items, but there were also some hot items. Not over-inspiring but absolutely fine to fuel up for a days sightseeing. The hotel has free wi-fi but it barely connected on the 6th floor, so I had to bring my netbook to the lobby to get online. A minor inconvenience. Whilst the main tourist sites are not right on the doorstep as such, the Grand Bazaar is only 8-10 minutes walk away, and Sultanahmet only another 8-10 minutes further on. Easy walking distance in good weather. In addition, the Aksaray and Laleli University tram stops are only 5 minutes away in either direction, and for 2TL (roughly UK 75p/ US $1.20) you can get to Sultanahmet, Eminonu (for ferries & Bosphorus cruises) or continue across the Golden Horn to Karakoy (for the Galata Tower and walking up busy Istiklal St) or to the end of the line for the Dolmabahce Palace. Great value. I did a lot of walking in my first couple of days, but started using the tram on day 3 and it was much easier (except during rush hour when the trams are crammed). For getting back to Ataturk Airport (during the daytime/evening), you can either get a tram from Aksaray and change at to the Metro at Zeytinburne (you'll need a 2TL jeton for each part of the 2 part journey). Alternatively, if you walk out of the hotel, up to the main road, turn left down the hill past Aksaray tram station, across the crossroads and keeping on the RIGHT hand side of the busy road walk for about 0.75 mile/1 km (following the right hand bend in the road) you'll reach the Aksaray Metro/Underground station. From here you can get a metro to the airport for 2TL with no changes required. Istanbul is a fascinating, bustling and vibrant city to visit, with so much history and wonderful architecture. The mosques in particular are magnificent, and it was brilliant to sit in the park between the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia around dusk and wait for darkness to fall and see both mosques lit up. Istanbul is definitely worth a visit, and give yourself enough time to enjoy everything. The Prestige Hotel, whilst modest, was absolutely fine. I found it clean and the staff friendly. Room size was fine, and the room was clean (and had a fridge and air conditioning). I couldn't ask for more for a reasonable price. The only \"drawback\" for some might be that its not closer to the main tourist places, but it's comfortable walking distance away and close to the tram lines, and I found the location (for the price) absolutely fine. I would certainly recommend it, and I'll certainly stay there again when I revisit Istanbul.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel\u201d", "Author": "carlpoll", "ReviewID": "UR119704249", "Content": "Other Tripadvisor reviews had made us a bit uncertain about the Prestige Hotel but it suited us very well. We spent four nights there. It's right near a tram stop so you can get around very easily. It's walking distance to the Bazaar and Sultanahmet where all the main sites are. All in all, very convenient and good value. We had connecting rooms for ourselves and our two teenagers. The rooms and bathrooms were very good and clean. Breakfast was also very good with a comprehensive selection. We were there on sunny October days so there wasn't a temperature problem. Not sure what it would be like in mid-summer because I don't think the air conditioning was working and the street is noisy. Even so, we had the windows open at night (watch out if you have children as they have nothing to restrict how far they swing open) and it wasn't too bad - the 6.00 a.m. call to prayers from the mosque over the road is all part of the experience. If you are going to spend a lot of time in your hotel, it's not what you'd expect of a 4-star in the UK and then you might understand all the niggles on other Tripadvisor reviews. But if you're out and about all day and want a decent place to sleep and eat breakfast, it's very good. Staff were generally very pleasant. The pool on the roof wasn't as bad as some reviewers suggest. It's small but clean.

So the last day we went to have breakfast at 8 am and all the turkish breads were over. Weird, isn't it? I asked some of the waiters why they didn't take out some turkish breads like ekmek, gevrek and simit and he told me that there were people who were taking food out from the restaurant.

Loved Istanbul.\u201d", "Author": "Vanhall", "ReviewID": "UR23305403", "Content": "We were pleased and surprised to find out that hotel is quite nice and not at all as described in the bad reviews we had seen earlier on tripadvisor. We have booked our tour (hotel included)via a travel agent in Constanta, Romania. In order to give our acceptance to the hotel we did read the reviews on tripadvisor.com and other similar sites and decided that it cannot be that bad. Constanta is not so far from Istanbul (only 650 km) so we traveled with our own car, and just to be sure we took clean towels and linen from home. Unfortunately they occupied the space in our car for nothing as the hotel proved to be clean and towels and linen as white and tidy as in any 3 stars hotel in this world. We have noticed the 4 stars ranking on the hotel site - http://www.hotelprestige.com.tr/ - but our travel agent presented it to us, honestly, as a 3 star hotel and i believe it is indeed more like a 3 stars hotel. (As we all know the stars ranking differs from country to country but if the price is cheap you can expect a 4 stars hotel to be less then average) We had a room with double bed wich was very confy and air conditioning wich can be set from inside the room to heating or cooling on our discretion. However the controls of the airconditioning were a little funny to play with, but doable. If pushing one or two buttons does not start your air conditioning does not mean that air conditioning is missing, you have to try harder. Inside the room, a TV set with flat screen on the wall, but only turkish, russian, ukrainean and bulgarian TV stations were available on sattelite TV. Too bad for other nationalities tourists. Even the CNN was in turkish. A minibar was also available. Bathroom was small indeed but rarely have seen larger in 3 stars hotels, with bath tub, turkinsh style (small and deep) and sink full covered in white marble. A hair dryer was available. Our room on the 6th floor had wooden floor (not so confy in the winter) but our friends on the 5th floor had carpet on the floor (quite old though). The hotel stair case, halls and elevators were very nice with music and telephone in the elevators. The bar and the reception hall were also nice and quiet while entrance in the hotel is interesting with white marble stairs and automatic elevating stairs and a small artificial waterfall between and small blue minilake below access stairs. Restaurant is as seen in hotel site, we had only breakfast buffet, wich was more then ok and additionally a cook at our disposal to make us hot omlet or pancakes on request. We stayed only 3 nights so we were not disturbed by the \"no variety\" thing, but a breakfast buffet means that you can chose your own food, every day something else if you like. All other meals we had them in the city and were quite delightfull. We could park our car easily in the vicinity of the hotel on a narrow street. Location of the hotel is good with only walking distance to most tourists attractions and resturants. As a generally overview i will recommend this hotel for those tourists wich preffers quiet places, it is clean, service personnel very quiet also, you can bearly feel they are there, wich makes you feels almost like at home. Very important the reception hall in the hotel it is designed as a NO SMOKING area including at the bar, but small areas had been designated by the hotel personnel for smoking just to make tourist happy, although if you ask for pemission they will say smoking is prohibited. As for the price i'm not sure what is the price on the front desk but our invoice we have signed on the end for the travel agency showed 30 EUR a day. I hope this description will help future travelers to decide if they will chose or not this hotel. I attached photos as well.
