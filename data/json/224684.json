Assuming the point of checking into a hotel is to actually sleep at night, then there's no point trying this place. First impressions were great, the location was very central and perfect for our requirements, the staff were friendly and the room was clean, an ok size and had everything you'd expect, there was the kind of traffic noise you'd expect from a downtown hotel, but nothing problematic. After we'd been in the room 5 minutes, the people next door came in. They weren't being noisy but we could hear every single word of their conversation, even when they turned the TV on. It was as though the walls were actually amplifying their conversation! This was clearly going to be a problem so we returned to the desk and were moved to a bigger room in a 'quiet' location for no extra charge. This seemed fine until just after 10pm when incredibly loud music started drifting up from the pub downstairs. This carried on for a few hours, but when it stopped it was replaced by loud singing by drunk people, accompanied by a irregular percussion that we think was coming for the water pipes. The doors have automatic closers on them so that they bang quite loudly, as if that wasn't enough noise and although we were at the opposite end of the corridor from the ice machine, you could hear quite clearly every time someone used it. The chap next door had a nasty cough and snored - not his fault, the the wall amplified every little noise, and every time the person in the room above got up to use the loo the footsteps were like distant thunder. We had booked 2 nights but after one almost completely sleepless night we checked out and went elsewhere. The staff are clearly familiar with the problem and didn't try and charge for the second night.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hudson, Florida", "Title": "\u201cMostly the same as last year, just one minor annoyance.\u201d", "Author": "jasonacg", "ReviewID": "UR124988357", "Content": "One year since my last visit, I booked another stay here. I received a room with the same floor plan as the previous year, one floor directly above last year's room. This room was equipped with a fixture that served as a dresser, with a small refrigerator behind another cabinet. It was nice having this extra storage, but it did make the entryway a little more cramped, particularly with a king-size bed in the room. Since my visit last year, many changes were made to the TV programming offered in the room. While the system has been upgraded to carry HD channels, it resulted in the loss of many of the channels that were previously available, including some local stations. What makes it worse, is that the new channel list that's left in the room, shows about twice as many channels, most of which aren't available at all. When you're trying to \"cool down\" after playing in the city, it would be nice to have more of an in-room selection. Aside from that little annoyance, the experience was nearly identical to last year. The room was clean and comfortable. The jetted tub is a nice bonus, especially after a long day on the slopes. Again, if you don't like noise at night, this is not the place for you. It's in the heart of the entertainment district. The streets in front of the hotel, will be crowded until well into the night, particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. All in all, it's a good value, for a hotel that's right in the center of everything. There's plenty of entertainment and dining options within walking distance, access to transit within a very short walk, and when the weather is clear, you can even look up Granville Street, and get a glimpse of the spectacular mountains on the North Shore.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice,central hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jambo1998", "ReviewID": "UR124787977", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights in November.

The room was acceptable, but some of the furniture was showing some wear. There were some cigarette burns on the desk. However, the room was clean and ready upon check-in. I have posted pictures of the room. If I had to use one word to describe the room, it would be small. I think the room was smaller than the cabin we ended up having on the cruise ship, and definitely smaller than the ones shown on their webpage. The property is older and has obviously been renovated. I would say they are doing the best with the building they have. Also, the view out our window left something to be desired. However, it faced away from the street, so we did not hear any noise from traffic. There was a continental breakfast available each morning \u2013 which was served in the Irish pub that was also located on the property. It was standard fare \u2013 a good start to a morning. Front desk staff was helpful and willing to answer our questions. We were able to store our bags at no charge upon check-out when we learned our cruise ship would be boarding 5 hours late. Overall, a good stay. We found most hotels in the area were quite pricey and we were looking to save some money. Also, we spent most of the time out and about exploring, so the small accommodations were not too bothersome.

Another really big plus was the friendly staff. They were very obliging and they made stay as enjoyable as possible. The hotel itself sits above Doolins Irish Pub, which is both a pro and a con. There are lots of fast food or takeaway joints near the motel, but very few restaurants. So Doolins is a good option for food. However you must get in early otherwise you won't get a seat. This place packs em in as the night progresses. And sitting below Doolins is the Cellar nightclub which stays open untill the wee hours of the morn. We stayed on level 1 and I have to admit, we didn't hear as much 'doof doof' as we expected. On Friday and Saturday nights, the police close the roads at 9pm to let the clubbers have free reign. This causes confusion when getting public transport or a taxi back to the motel.

The breakfast at the Irish pub underneath the hotel was great, they had make your own waffles which was a highlight. :-)", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma City, OK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location!\u201d", "Author": "ajones6", "ReviewID": "UR14447054", "Content": "Very cute decor and great location. Staff was helpful and friendly. Clean rooms. Our room was very small, but we booked a \"One Queen Bed\" room at a discounted rate. It was perfect for what we were using it for, which was sleeping, but if you're planning to spend a lot of time in your room, invest in a larger room. The location couldn't be better. It's right in the middle of downtown and there is a bus stop on the corner. We did see a couple of hookers on the corner late one night, but we had no problems. There is a pub on the ground floor and they serve breakfast there every morning. Keep in mind that there are lots of homeless people in downtown Vancouver- but it's everywhere. In my opinion, if you are there to sight see, just buy a pack of bus passes at 711 and skip the cabs until you have to. Public transportation is easy in Vancouver. There are buses, skytrain, and seabus (ferry) and they all use the same tickets. $2.50 for one zone ticket and $3.75 for two zones. There is a website where you punch in your starting location and where you want to go and it will map out your trip for you. **Be sure to try out the MegaBite Pizza place.", "Date": "March 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cGood deal!\u201d", "Author": "tracyk88", "ReviewID": "UR13405157", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel from a Thursday to Saturday. The rooms were surprisngly large and well decorated. Unfortunately the design of the lobby makes it difficult to carry up large luggage because there are no ramps to roll up so you have to carry all your bags up the short flights of stairs. The only other problem I had with the hotel was that it was noisy at night. My window faced out to the main street and I could hear music and the deep bass beats all night. Fortunately I brought ear plugs, so I was able to sleep but I would recommend all future visitors to also bring them! Otherwise, the staff were great and accommodating and there were no other problems. The complimentary breakfast was sparse but I enjoyed the waffles. All in all, if you can tolerate a bit of noise at night, this hotel is a great deal and in a convenient location!", "Date": "February 9, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Comfort Inn Downtown", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d224684-Reviews-Comfort_Inn_Downtown-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$103 - $199*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">654 Nelson Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Vancouver</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">British Columbia</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">V6B 6K4</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "224684", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/4d/03/dc/heart-of-the-entertainment.jpg"}}
