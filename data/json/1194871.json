The rooms are stylish andwell furnished and the bath-tub is huge (a real find). The restaurant/bar does not do the hotel any favours and had no atmosphere, but there are a few good places to eat nearby. Breakfast is a continental buffet, but you can ask for eggs, bacon & sausages etc if you want. One minor gripe is that there is no option to bill the internet access directly to your room. The hotel does provide fee access codes that are suitable for \"casual\" internet use, but heavy users like myself need to purchase a \"business\" package using a credit/debit card. Not a painful process, but one more recipt to add to the expense claim", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Espa\u00f1a", "Title": "\u201cExcellent for Businesss\u201d", "Author": "Posted by a NH Hoteles traveler", "ReviewID": "UR130400221", "Content": "I stay in Madrid a lot, and this is perfect for business in the LAS TABLAS area, rooms are spacious and clean and the staff are exceptionally friendly.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fes", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel with great facilities and perfect staff.

Although it is situated in a industrial area, accross the road is a big El Corte Ingl\u00e9s and a Hipercor supermarkt. Nice rooms, soundproof. If you open the window, you will hear the noise from the A-1 motorway. Staff is very correct and helpfull. Nice lobby with TV and enough sofa's. 2 elevators are very convenient. Great breakfast! We stayed the weekend with the special \"Weekend Extender\". Very reasonable prices, breakfast and late check-out till 17 p.m. Free drinks and snacks from mini bar (without refill).Welness is a delight. Good showers and lockers available. We would love to come back some day. We can recommand this hotel to everyone.

The great: very well designed, modern, clean. Great price/quality ratio. Plus has nice facilities such as gym and sauna (and they claim a swimming pool, but it's more a bath because you can't swim there). the not so great: location - it's 30 min away of the center by taxi, no public transport, nothing nearby (only business). Breakfast is ok - except for the staff - they don't speak English, are terribly inneficient and rude. this is the reason why i give them 3 stars instead of 4 - their bad mood and bad service ruins even the best night sleep there. Why should you stay in this hotel? it's a very nice designed hotel and if you need to be in this area of Madrid, it's a good looking hotel and the best in the area. Why you shouldn't stay here: if you need to be in the city center in rush hours, forget it. there are always traffic jams and it's just a night mare.

The car dealers are the other closest neighbours, plus a few construction sites or \"properties for development\". Generally speaking, no reason to stay here unless you are doing business in the neighbourhood. The price level isn't low either. Even though newly built & modern in design, the use of low quality interior materials gives that it starts to look a bit worn already. The rooms are quite small, the beds are nothing better than typical and the motorway noise gets into the room even if most rooms are not directly facing it. The spa is closed for renovation. The gym is small - like 8 machines in all, but better than nothing. The personnel in the front desk checks you in and out without a smile and I have to wait both for check-in as well as for check-out since only one person was indeed working at the front desk. The breakfast is nice with a good Spanish selection (and likely the best with this hotel), even though the breakfast room does not feel that welcoming.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "spain", "Title": "\u201cWell worth the price\u201d", "Author": "bonitatime", "ReviewID": "UR68712780", "Content": "I wasn't sure what to expect as some of the comments on here were not so good but it was well worth the money. My daughter and I were in Madrid for 3 days for the summer sales and the hotel was ideal. On arrival in Madrid airport we purchased a 3 day tourist pass which covered us for the bus and metro in Madrid. This is certainly worthwhile as the metro to get to the hotel would have been 3 euros befor we went anywhere else. The rooms are standard 3 star NH rooms. Twin beds with bedside acbinets and a TV. A wardrobe in the passageway with a safe and a minibar. The bathroom had a bath, sink toilet and bidet. There was shampoo bath gel and soap which were replaced every day. The staff on reception were very helpful and I managed to make a mistake with the safe and someone came out to open it within 30 mins which was wonderful. The spa area was the reason we finally booked the hotel as we felt this would be an advantage after a long days shopping and it didnt dissapoint. Although small it has a pool with jacizzi area, a sauna and a turkish bath. The hotel is out of the way and requires 2 metro trains at least to get to the centre. There is a large Corte Ingles between the hotel and the metro which has a supermarket inside if you need anything.", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Hotel - Hard to believe a tourist would stay here\u201d", "Author": "ordflyer", "ReviewID": "UR56603631", "Content": "A plain and simple hotel, located on a busy street with many company offices nearby I can't imagine a tourist staying here.

About \u20ac25 from the airport via taxi, this fairly modern looking hotel is very plain and simple in desgin, layout and comforts. Functional, and at a rate of about \u20ac85 per night - it was almost a bargain. Surprisingly quite given the location on the street, my \"no smoking\" room was clearly smoked in. Upon complaining - it was explained to me that the room was in fact no-smoking. No offer to move me, no thought that there might be an issue .... who knows, perhaps they had heard this before. Breakfast included, a simple breakfast that was OK in general, and nothing special.
