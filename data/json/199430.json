The hallways do in fact smell, and it is next to impossible to open the door to the business lounge. Their website also boasted free wifi in the business lounge's computer, but by that, they mean you have to log in with the one code you were given. They say you can get wifi in all of their rooms, but that is untrue. We are staying in a first class room, but there is no wifi reception whatsoever. If you're upgrading to business/first class for the unlimited pop, don't get your hopes up because they only leave 1-2 bottles of pop out and do not restock in a timely manner. The locks on their first class and business class rooms are also impossible to figure out. How can a door have no handle on the outside?

Once you get the ticket, then be sure to validate it (this goes for all the trains too). You validate the ticket on the bus - there is a machine with a slot that you push the ticket in and it makes a cut in the ticket. The tickets only give you a limited amount of time to make the trip, so don't buy the ticket a day in advance. Then take the bus to the Ulandstrasse stop -- about 15 minutes into the trip. This stop will be just past the intersection of Ulandstrasse and Kurfurstendamm. Keep walking in the direction of the bus a half block to Meinkestrasse and then take a right (the only way you can go on this street). The hotel is a couple of blocks down on the left hand side. The alternative is a taxi that will set you back about 18 euros... the difference is the price of a good meal! The hotel is much like any big chain hotel - very nice and clean - with a trendy sushi restaurant on the first floor (loud house music). For a great cafe - go out the hotel front door and make a left. You'll come to Lietzenburger Strasse right away, make another left to get to Joachimstrasse in one block. Make a right on Joachimstrasse and then go to the next corner and make a right -- the cafe begins with a \"P\" - like Pippi or something. Skip the 8 euro breakfast and eat here. They have wonderful crossiants, coffee, sandwiches etc. and all very reasonably priced for the area. Of course there are many choices on Meinikestrasse and up on Kurfurstendamm, which is the main West Berlin boulevard. The Starbucks on Kurf also has free wifi for 2 hours, something that the Mark won't give you unless you pony up an extra 10 euros/night for a business class room. But the comfort level room was fine -- like a Holiday Inn or similar. Not tons of space, but large enough to get around in comfortably. There is a small fitness room with a track - but you're much better off going for long walks and sightseeing. I found the staff to be very efficient and helpful - they have a direct line to the taxis - they push a button and a taxi appears in usually under 5 minutes. Got a great rate and had a discount card from Expedia -- I'd stay again.", "Date": "October 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "City of San Marino, San Marino", "Title": "\u201cDecent for a 3-Star Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mugwump888", "ReviewID": "UR82501139", "Content": "I stayed for a bit more than a week.

Berlin is such a HUGE city that it would be quite dificult to find a hotel close to everything anyway! The only thing i would say in a mildly negitive way about the Mark, is that there are no tea and coffee making facilities in your room. I have never stayed at a hotel without this facility so was very surprised, you do however get a mini bar. which is quite reasonable by mini bar standards. I would highly reccomend Marjellchen Restaurant in Mommsenstrasse 9. It is a traditional german restaurant, the food was superb and the owner made it a memorable experience, you can easily get a taxi to it from the Mark for 5 Euros. The volume of places to eat aand drink is phenomenal and i can safely say we did not have any complaints. The Berlin wall was a truly somber place, be prepared to well up.

The breakfast wasn't great - only good if you like bread and cold meats in the morning. Overall, it was fine for a convenient base, but if you'd prefer to be closer to the best shops and sights, I'd recommend staying in the Mitte district, as I felt the shops on Friedrishstrasse were better - the department store KaDeWe is overrated, and one short trip on the subway to it would be suffice for most I think.

We slept with the window open which was fine until around 6:00 a.m. when the binmen arrived! The rooms were quite small but adequate for a short stay and were clean and tidy with mini bar fridge and flat screen TV but sadly no tea and coffee making facilities. The shower room was equally small and moving around inside the corner shower cubicle required a certain skill but was fine once one had got the hang of it. I would agree with some of the other reviewers who have commented on the hotel's boring and somewhat dated decor. The bedrooms corridors are especially grim with dark brown walls and low level lighting they resembled a prison more than a hotel. There is a typical German pub directly across the road from the hotel which is much nicer to relax in than the somewhat sterile (and more expensive) hotel bar. There are also several restaurants along the street the best of which, in my view, being the Gasthaus Krombach which served good typical German food at very reasonable prices. There's even an Imbiss (snack bar) at the end of the road if all you want is a snack. The best thing about the hotel is its location. It's easy to get to from Tegel airport and is about five minutes walk from the Zoo Garden train station where you can get both U-Bahn and S-Bahn trains to any part of the city. It's also close to the Kuf\u00fcrstendamm which is a major shopping street for those in need of some retail therapy. And, of course, it's near to the Berlin Zoo which is worth a look.

All together we were a group of 8 on a 3 night stay in Berlin as part of a package starting from Thursday through to Sunday. We decided to book an extra night online and arrive on a Wednesday. When we arrived at the hotel, the reception staff appeared to be very unhelpful, I would say to state they were not friendly would be an understatement. So we proceeded to check in, or at least attempted to. The receptionist then informed us that dispite booking on Expedia with this hotel, they were not expecting us until the following day, where 3 nights were booked. Instead they told us that we were in their sister hotel for 1 night. We were told to go, the only instruction given was to turn right outside door and straight down. After about ten minutes of lugging our luggage around we found an old building which later we found was the sister hotel. Walking in the hotel was dirty and dated. Our hotel room was really not an improvement. Very basic facilities with dated furniture. We had a small fridge with a mini bar, which had a selection of 6 drinks. The hotel was situated in a seedy part of town. The bathroom was small. The shower sprayed more water over the curtian then into the bath itself, each time after taking a shower the bathroom floor was soaked. We decided to go back and urgue our case. We booked the Berlin Mark Hotel and not the Appt Berlin Mark Hotel. When we went the back the unhelpful receptionist's told us that in fact we were expected there and not the sister hotel, we should never have been sent away. Although it was there error, they actually still refused to move us, they told us it was too late to be moved as we had already checked in. We asked to speak to a Manager for help, they told us to take a seat. After about 15 minutes we re-approached the receptionist as nobody came out to see us, and were told that there was nothing they could do, despite it being their error. We gave up and returned the following day for the remainder of our stay. The hotel was not much of an improvement. Room was very basic with the same features of the old Appt Berlin Hotel. Breakfast was always busy. Tables were hardly ever cleared from the previous people and by the time a fresh pot of coffee arrived, or your milk did - it was time to leave. The service was dreadful. Throughout our stay we would often liase with recpeption staff, but again they were always unhelpful. They appeared not to want to help you, and was always a real effort engaging with them. Not once did they smile. A memeber of our group was sent to another hotel to iron her eveining clothes - when she returned stating that she could not find hotel they directed her the hotel opposite. They could have done this at the begining instead of sending her on a hike of the backstreets of Berlin. So, if you are not looking for service, unfriendly staff, basic facilities then I recommend you book this place!

We had booked as part of a group for three nights from Thursday and then booked an extra night for the Wednesday night via Expedia. Although this was advertised and showed photogaphs of the Berlin Mark on Meineke Strasse we found this not to be the case AFTER we had arrived at the hotel and the receptionist simply looked up the reservation in her system, pointed to the crossroads and informed us that the hotel we were staying in was around the corner and four minutes away. No map, no directions and no further offer of assistance. We went to visit the hotel to find that it was a converted apartment block in a rather seedy part of a very busy road. No Bar, a makeshift breakfast room. No restaurant and a basic bedroom which was large but a rather dirty and poorly decorated bathroom. We retrurned to the Berlin Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse to plead our case that we we were under the impression that we had booked that hotel and wanted to be there for the four nights and not have to change the following day as our friends were due to arrive the next day. Suddenly, the receptionist found a reservation for us which means that they had expected us all along and was about to check us into that hotel when she realised that her colleague had sent us off to another property. In fact BOTH receptionists on Thursday afternoon were very surly and discourteous and even after me asking if I could speak with somebody else and being TOLD to take a seat in the bar as it would take a while before someone could see us, we were left waiting until I had to go back to the empty desk to see if somebody could talk to us. All I could be told was that as I had booked through Expedia, there was nothing they could do. I tried politely to explain that after 25 years int he hotel industry I knew that they could, in fact, transfer a booking within the hotel if they really wanted to - again, to no avail. If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks but as it has lots of stairs and no lift it is also below standard. We finally accepted our fate and reconciled to spend the night in the cell block. the only saviour was the ARTOTEL across the street which had a nice bar and pleasant staff so they got our business. The shower in the bathroom simply sprayed water everywhere in the \"APART HOTEL\" (read falling APART Hotel) causing the bathroom floor to flood and cause a very dangerous health & safety hazard Breakfast in the Mark Hotel in Meineke Strasse was absolutely chaotic with surly, rude staff who snapped at you if you asked them to bring tea or coffee pots or more orange juice or bread fort oast. A member of our group was sent by reception to two local dry cleaners shops to get an outfit for that evening ironed before sending her to their hotel accross the street where they had a laundry facility all the time thus wasting an hour and making her late for her evening function. So, some of the poorest service I have ever experienced, misleading advertising, surly/miserable/rude staff and awful public areas.

The hotel is very basic and the room I was given had a single bed (I haven't seen this in hotels for years!) and was smaller than most student accommodation I have seen! The room was extremely basic and the bed and pillow were far too soft, which made me have a terrible time sleeping. I was also given a smoking room. I don't recall Expedia (with whom I booked) asking if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room, so I felt I didn't have arguments to change. When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change. Fair enough, but I think there is only one floor in the whole building (of 7 floors) that is non-smoking, so be aware of that when booking. The staff are helpful and nice but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment. The decor is very early 80s with some nauseating bright green everywhere... It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room, but I suppose that is just me. Brekfast is plentiful but very basic. Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking. In fact, the hotel reeked of cigarettes.

When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.The room given to us was on the first floor. Supposedly a non smoking room it came complete with ash tray and matches. The room was not very big and the bed took up the majority of the room. The room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked an overgrown garden with a block of flats looking directly onto the rooms. Although the bed linen was clean there wasn't much going for the room at all. The furniture is dark brown and very old and battered and the sliding wardrobe door seemed to be just about hanging on. As for the bathroom well what can we say. The shower sliding door is barely big enough for a normal sized person to get through. The frame of the shower was also falling to pieces and came off in your hand when you closed the door.The shower had no height adjustment bar and so showering each morning was quite difficult. Also it was difficult to regulate the water and it was either boiling hot or freezing cold. You either had to sit cross legged on the shower floor or stand up and use the shower by hand. The hot tap became very hot and a towel had to be used to turn it off. We complained to management three times but nothing was done. One of the lamps over the sink had blown and despite telling the cleaner it was still not changed. The bathroom had had the tiles painted to give the appearance of a newly refurbished room. Breakfast was hardly worth the effort. There were not enough tables for everyone and some people who couldn't get a table ended up going away. If you came down late most of the food had gone and was not replenished. Coffee was luke warm and not a teabag in sight only various types of Twinings darjeeling. We did notice a room next to reception with more tables and a waitress walking in and out with coffee but no one was told if this room was an extra room for breakfast. In fact the room was used to store suitcases for people checking out of their rooms. It was not locked so anyone could walk in.

We had no worries at this hotel and would stay there again if in Berlin.", "Date": "May 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5016236", "Content": "Nice, quite big hotel 100 m to the kufurstendam. we stayed for 2 nights at the hotel. we had a big room with a lot of space. accros the street there is a nice typical german restaurant which offers good prices. the berlin mark hotel is a excellent hotel and if you wil visite Berlin you really should take this hotel!!!!!", "Date": "April 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "High Wycombe, Bucks, England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4967374", "Content": "We have just returned from a 4 night stay in Berlin and stayed at this hotel. Everything about it is good. Clean rooms, plenty of hot water for showers etc. Hair dryers, excellent maid service. Breakfast something else - everything you could wish for to start the day and a good time slot too - breakfast at the week end is served until 12 noon!!! Ideal for sleepyheads! The only down point was that it is just along the road from the Hard Rock Cafe which appears to close around 2am - but if you close the windows (they are double glazed) it doesnt really bother you too much. The location of this hotel is perfect - right on the doorstep to the shops, underground, buses and sight-seeing buses too. We found a fantastic restaurant too in Joachimstaler Strasse called Blauer Flug - really good meal there too so all in all we spent a fantastic 4 day city break in Berlin and cant wait to go back!", "Date": "April 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "NorwayLiv", "ReviewID": "UR4720468", "Content": "We stayed here fore three nights, and will do it again.

The room was on the small side but it was very clean the bathroom was huge and modern. The only complaint about the room might be that it was kind of small but this didn't bother us as we just wanted a clean, safe place to sleep. The breakfast (included in the price) was AMAZING! No continental breakfast here! There were eggs, cold cuts, sausage, bacon (one morning), yogurt, fresh and dried fruits, juice, crackers, several different kinds of bread, dessert, etc. You could easily take some stuff for a little snack later in the day. The breakfast alone was worth the price. The location was good. It was under a 10 minute walk to the Berlin Zoo station from which you can catch trains and the metro (U-Bahn). It was right off of the main shopping street. I personally thought that all of the interesting sights seemed to be in East Berllin and found that we were going there to eat, sightsee, etc. Otherwise, I can't really complain about the location. It's right next to the Hard Rock Cafe and down the block from a Dunkin Donuts/Easy Internet cafe. It might be worth mentioning that there seemed to be a lot of school/tour groups staying in the hotel. Sometimes you could hear them in the hallways but it was never a problem or really annoying at all. Also, there was usually a wait for a table at breakfast because everyone in the group seems to eat at the same time. No matter where you stay I highly recommend taking the Free Berlin tour (it leaves from in front of the Dunkin Donuts across from the Berlin Zoo station and you can find info about it posted there). This was really a great tour and it was a highlight of the trip for me.", "Date": "March 13, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Berlin Mark Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d199430-Reviews-Berlin_Mark_Hotel-Berlin.html", "Price": "$70 - $186*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Meinekestrasse 18-19</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10719</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "199430", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/20/c7/20c754719c23ba33190f08af6c73ce9e6large.jpg"}}
