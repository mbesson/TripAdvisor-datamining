The apartment had a separate bedroom and another separate sleeping area, away from the living room, two bathrooms and a completely workable kitchen. The view over the canal was amazing and on New years Eve was a real treat with fireworks galore all over the city skyline. Very comfortable.

This is a traditional hotel with friendly and helpful staff. Note that the walk from the nearest public transport can include crossing up to 3 canal bridges which can be a little tricky with trolley luggage, especially with cyclists coming at you from all directions with no signals given! Amsterdam is relatively expensive with hotels costing at least 50% more than similar hotels in Brussels say. The room rate of 134 Euros for a room for 2 including breakfast (August 2011) is reasonable for Amsterdam. The only \"extras\" included is free Wifi and an older traditional TV (not flat screen). The shower was a little feeble and there was no fridge, room safe or free tea/coffee making facilities. However a hairdryer could be borrowed free of charge from the reception where a hotel safe is available if required. For the 1st time visitor to Amsterdam, the \"I amsterdam City Card\" is a must (available at the tourist information office opposite the entrance to the Central Station). This tourist card is actually 2 separate cards, one for the public transport and the other for entrance to sights. Whilst 59 Euros for 72 hours sounds expensive, it includes all public transport, a 1-hour canal trip and entrance to a number of museums which could cost between 8-14 euros each. Note that the public transport card must be registered both on entry AND exit from trams, etc. Failure to register on exit will void the card! Two restaurants of note are the \"Tujuh Laret\" (Utrechtsestraat 73), for Dutch Indonesian cuisine, and the \"Haesje Claes\" (Spuistraat 273-275), for traditional Dutch (and other) cuisine. Both offer good value and very good food with friendly staff. The \"Tujuh Laret\" is rather basic, somewhat \"rustic\" inside, but the food is worth it. However, on our visit we found the restaurant relatively hot and humid and so less comfortable than we liked. The \"Haesje Claes\" is a traditional restaurant which is comfortable but very busy. If you haven't booked, then get there before 6.30pm to be reasonably sure of getting a table! We liked the food and service at the \"Haesje Claes\" so much that we ate there 3 nights running! In central Amsterdam, watch out for cyclists (both pedal and motorised) coming from all directions including along and across pavements, with no signals and the expectation that you'll get out of their way! Despite this, there's plenty to see and do. Our recommended sights include: Amsterdam Museum, Van Gogh Museum (get there early to avoid long queues), Rembrandt's house, Anne Frank's House/Museum (again, get there early to avoid long queues), Koninklijk Paleis, the Hidden Church (inside a house), Rijksmuseum, de Oude Kerk, etc.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood choice\u201d", "Author": "Cabbagetowntoronto", "ReviewID": "UR115987339", "Content": "Location is charming,just near the Amstel river on a quiet lane.

The hotel is very convenient to the Waterlooplein and Rembrandtplein areas, including a tram to Central Station, and an easy walk to the tram (#7, #10) that is just a few stops away from the Leidesplein or the Museumplein or Vondel Park areas. There are no restaurants immediately next door, but an easy walk to cafes and restaurants. The staff were nice and helpful. I was traveling alone and had a very small single room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so small I wondered at the outset if I had made a mistake. However, with a little getting used to, the room was just fine. Nothing fancy, but functional. I glanced in other rooms when doors were open as I was walking by, and they seemed much more spacious, so I think size is only an issue for the single rooms. The breakfast spread was generous, particularly in comparison to continental breakfasts that are offered in the US. Most of my stay was reasonably quiet, although the thinness of the walls was apparent one evening when my neighbors had their television turned on loudly. Free wifi was offered. Although the hotel did not have air-conditioning, it also wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t needed, as it was cool in the evenings. I think Amsterdam is a beautiful city; let me offer a couple of quick suggestions that you may not find in the guidebooks. First, everyone bikes in Amsterdam, and I highly recommend that way of getting around. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to biking, it actually doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take that long to get around Amsterdam. If you are looking for a really pretty, longer ride with little chance of getting lost, you can rent a bike and just follow the Amstel River going south, away from the city (bring the camera for the shots of windmills across the river), or for the more adventurous, you can bike along the dijks northeast of the city. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to rent a bike for 24 hours, but also don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to bring it back at 5:45, as required by MacBikes, there is a place called Star Bikes behind Central Station that rents bikes that can be returned at 7:00 pm. Second, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do like I did and try to find the free Wednesday noontime classical music rehearsals/concerts at the Concertgebouw during the summer\u00e2\u20ac\u201c they apparently only have these during the regular season (not in summer months). :-) Luckily, there are plenty of other opportunities for all kinds of music in Amsterdam.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cRoom with a view !\u201d", "Author": "edinpaul", "ReviewID": "UR74471467", "Content": "Stayed here for a weekend with my friends.

The hotel I would describe as traditional Dutch buildiing with a modern twist to the interior. We had a room with no view but I would imagine the rooms at the front have great views of the canal. The rooms are modern with very clean and tidy wetroom style bathrooms. For Amsterdam, bedrooms were large and spacious. Breakfast is served in the basement and is traditional Continental Europe fare, with plenty on offer for all. I liked the area.

We had asked for a room on the first floor, when reservations were made, and our request was granted. The buffet breakfast was especially nice. Nancy had sent us directions on how to get to the hotel by tram. Great experience, and the tram is what we used to get around Amsterdam. The staff was helpful regarding our questions as to the day trips by train in which we were interested. Very easy to do. There are no major restaurants in the area, but found a little one close to the hotel that had good food, with staff kind enough to translate the menu for us. The area around the hotel is unigue and yes, we would gladly stay there again.

It has fabulous views of the Amstel. As an appartment it has everything you could want - comfortable beds and good clean bathrooms, a kitchen equipped with kettle, mugs, tea/coffee, fridge and dishwasher. It is well heated - which we needed as the evenings were drawing in. We found that hiring an appartment rather than the usual hotel bedrooms was much cheaper and somehow a greater level of privacy and yet in the lounge area we could sit and relax with friends. The one disadvantage was that it is at the very top of the building - on the fourth floor. That meant a strenuous climb up quite steep stairs. The hotel is in a good position situated next door to a beautiful theatre. There is an excellent Indonesian restaurant in the basement - very good service and extremely tasty rijstafel. It is a few minutes walk to either Waterlooplein or Weesperplein for the trams or metro. We visited the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum which were as expected - excellent. But the Van Loon museum and the Wilet Holthuysen were unexpected gems to be savoured. We also visited the Cat Boat - interesting for any cat lovers out there. We spent a lot of time and money at the floating flower market as it is just the right time of year for buying tulip bulbs! We ate at the 'Five Flies' but I was disappointed with exceptionally slow service and food that was definitely over priced. The restaurant itself is certainly interesting to visit - but I wouldn't go there to eat again. There are too many other well run, friendly restaurants serving excellent food to go back to that one.
