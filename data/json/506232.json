Check in easy and quick. I'm always surprised that people would allow a hotel to retain their passport. I NEVER leave my passport with anyone. In this case I insisted they copy it and give it back immediately. No dramas. Room was adequate, clean with a nice creek view. No tea making facilities (annoying) but room service was 24 hours, quick and reasonably priced. Had to ask for a robe. Lift waiting time ok. Local supermarkets close by and a 15 minute walk to Deira City Centre Shopping Centre (big and good range of shops). Breakfast in restaurant pretty average. Order room service. Cheaper and you can eat it in your pjs! In Perth this would be a 3 star.

I couldn't get a cab at 6pm Thursday evening so I walked from Union station on Dubai Metro as it was a cool evening. Simple 5 minute check in, they did keep my passport, but that wasn't a problem. The hotel is 'dry' and so I had to go out for my weekly beer. Lively cafe on ground floor. Breakfast on the mezzanine was fine the next morning and check-out only took 5 minutes.

It was a school trip with 32 undergraduates. Location The hotel is within walking distance to various important areas. It is near the international airport and metro station. The hotel has a strategic location near the Dubai Creek where my friends and I have evening strolls with chilly breezes. Right across the creek is the Bur Dubai area with the Dubai Museum and a wide range of shops selling goods like carpets and clothes for bargain. Cheap and good eateries are located behind the hotel. In addition, there are supermarkets, beauty salons and laundry service providers. Room The room was equipped with comfortable sofas and beds \u2013 making it a cosy place to reside in. The homey yet classy ambience of the room is attributed to the beautiful oil paintings hung around the room. Though the apartment provides hairdryers upon request, the iron and ironing board are already placed within the apartment. The kitchen is well equipped with an oven, refrigerator, washing machine, stove and a cabinet filled with cooking and eating utensils. Service The hotel provided us the service of keeping our luggage in a hotel room while we travelled to Qatar- Doha and returned to check into the hotel again on another date. I had the misfortune of misplacing one of my bags in the hotel \u2013 and the latter contained important items. The staff was really helpful in searching for my misplaced bag and it was returned to me by Jose on Christmas Day. Without the help of the hotel staff, I would have never been able to retrieve my bag. My laptop always has problems with the internet connection via wireless. I had to ask for IT assistance and this became a ritual every night. The IT staff patiently and religiously helped me connect to the internet every night. After 3 nights of continuously asking for IT assistance, embarrassed, I stopped short of asking for further assistance. To my surprise, Nawaz, the IT staff turned up at my doorstep at 11+pm [the usual time I call for IT assistance] to check on my internet connectivity and better still \u2013 he managed to permanently resolve my laptop issue. The concierge staff - Charlie and Thomas are friendly and ready to help us anytime from the booking of the cab to tours and helping out with the luggage. The reception staff consisting of Hisham, Rose and Marwan are quick and helped me to change my rooms when needed even during peak period. Abdullah, Savan and Jose ensured smooth and fast check in for all the 32 students and 2 coordinators within 20 minutes. Amenities The hotel itself is well-equipped with many travel agencies, hairdressers and restaurants. There is a pool and a gym. Likes & Dislikes There are few negative points about the hotel, in my opinion. My first complaint is of the lifts. As there are only 2 lifts servicing the 15 levels of the hotel, the waiting time for the lift may take longer than usual especially during the breakfast hours. My second complaint is that the swimming pool is rather small. Points that I like: the staff, the hotel location, the apartment itself and the amenities.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sohar, Oman", "Title": "\u201cAbove Average Below Premium\u201d", "Author": "Suresh75", "ReviewID": "UR119315792", "Content": "I've stayed alone for 2 nights and the stay was good except few glitches. The room is big, clean and has two sections with 2 toilets (1 in the bathroom), 2 televisions, there are lot of furniture every where (more than required I think) with total 7 wooden chairs to sit. So has to look around carefully to not to crash into one. The bathroom is big and worked well, they even provide you a shaving kit, tooth brush, paste etc... apart from the regular soap and shampoo. The airconditioner's setting wasn't able to be changed, it was set at 19\" which was very cold, next day it was at 22\" and at the morning it was showing 19\" - so be ready for a really chilling (cold) experience if you are going to stay there. The locality is good and you can walk around to many shopping areas, water taxis etc... The staff allowed me for a late checkout, break fast was reasonable and priced reasonable as well. They have a valet parking but with a single driver to manage the job with a small parking to manage in front of the hotel, so expect delays and be patient (last day I had to wait for around 30 minutes to leave the area after picking my vehicle).

This isn't the place for that but luckily we only booked two nights then had booked another 4 nights at Emirates Harbour Hotel at the Dubai marina which had a bit more glitz. My father flew in from Glasgow a day before us and his standard room 607 (i think) was just your usual 'classic' looking hotel room. The bathroom was a bit dated but the rest of the decor looked fresh and clean although he did say the bed was rock hard. We arrived from Brissie refreshed (i love it when you get upgraded!!!) and we then moved into 9902, a 2 bed apartment which was an interesting mix with fake renaissance style furnishings and dodgy 1980's bathrooms. The apartment was big but the bedrooms were average size with only one ensuite. The kitchen had all the essentials but was grubby with broken and missing crockery and glasses. (Free) Breakfast is basic but ok and enough to keep you going. We ate in the restaurant one night which was like a ghost town, which is weird considering its packed in the morning. It was nothing special and the service was poor and slow seeing as we were the only people in there. We stayed here to experience the creek and souks but it was just in the middle of nothing with office blocks and some other hotels. A huge highway had to be negotiated to try and get to the creek so overall i feel the location is poor but at least the taxis are cheap. The Dubai City Centre Mall was 7dhms in a taxi (min fare is 10dhms) and we done the Big-Bus tour from there over 2 days. Its just a 'local' mall by Dubai standards but good enough for a short shopping trip. There's also a free shuttle bus back from the City Centre Mall which drops you near the footbridge and 24hr supermarket located just across the road from the hotel (and just up the road from the Big clock water tower thing). The supermarket was cheap as well for soft drinks, snacks etc. The pool was ok but it was empty (like the sauna and steam room which i had to switch on). The gym is split into two sides which i didn't find out about till day 2 thinking until then that it was weights and no cardio euqipment! Small and tired looking equipment but enough for a quick session. Overall it scrapes a 3-star rating for me but i know why concorde was put out of service...great in its day but now tired and ready for the makeover/scrap heap.

Fridge in room, but no tea/coffee facilities, big tv loads of channels. Nice hotel overall, big, light open spaces, the decor and feel were all fine. The online company we booked with (lastminute.com) had messed up our reservation and though they provided flights for 2 adults and a child, the room was only booked for 2 adults. The hotel reception dealt with this extremely well, an extra bed was provided, with no extra charge, inc the extra breakfast. Hotel 'extras' were quite reasonable. Minus points. No balcony and absolutely no way therefore of drying wet beach stuff (there was a clothesline in the bathroom but due to the aircon, clothes put on it took 3 days to dry) Breakfast was ok, but uninspiring and they have a strange system for getting coffee.. a waitress floats around with a jug every now and then, so if you just miss her 'cycle' you will have finished eating before your next chance to get a drink. Reception/concierge unhelpful about queries and requests, when we asked them to call us a taxi they offered the hotel car at four times the price. The free shuttle to/from the beach failed to collect us on the second day. Our complaint/query when we were forced to take a taxi back to the hotel met with no response. Location is fine-ish, ie its near the creek but a good 15 minutes walk to where its at ,in terms of restaurants, souks etc. Overall we were happy, we got a very good price deal and felt it was value for money, but it it was in the detail that it failed to deliver.
