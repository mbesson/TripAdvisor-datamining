I stayed at this hotel for eight nights in total, We had a two bedroom apartment. The apartment was very spacious with two bathrooms. The Kitchen was fully equipped including a washing machine and dryer. The only thing it lacked was a tea towel / wash cloth. Room was made up spotlessly every day.Staff at front desk spoke English and could help up with directions, booking a taxi etc Restaurant in the hotel does a very average breakfast - everything was cold. But the dinner was great with some really nice wines on offer. Starbucks is right outside the front door although coffee was so so.Gym  Tranquility room (with massage chairs) were fab! Just be aware the spas (which were great) were in the female and male change rooms so if you are a couple you can't have a spa together which I found a little dissapointing.Only negative points would be the Female spa didn't work for a couple of days we were there which spoilt it a little as thats one of the reasons we booked the hotel and as the hotel is relatively new taxi's had no idea where it was. The hotel has a great map thats points out where it is - remember to take this with you everyday!!!Location isn't that great however they do have a comp shuttle bus that drops you near the silk road markets ( A MUST) and to get anywhere in Beijing you just need to jump in a taxi which only ever costs AU$3 -$5.", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR984531617", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KAM79"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d850454-r17201546-Fraser_Residence_CBD_East_Beijing-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "850454", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
