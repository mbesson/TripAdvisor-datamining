We get there with reservation in hand and all of a sudden there's a mistake on Motel 6's end and we had to pay $60+ dollars more because of some explanation that only a motel 6 employee would understand, I've made over 50+ reservations in other Motel 6's and NEVER had an issue with my reservation price i get to this motel 6 and i have a prob. 3. I honestly don't like people in my room when im not there, for the first three days i would call front desk and say \"i would not like room service for my entire stay please do not disturb me\". What do i get ? room service everyday ! Lack of communication with thier staff point blank, i especially like being woken up every day in the morning with a woman asking me do i want room service to sign the maids log at 8am. 4. First thing i see when i go into the room on my 1st day is a huge roach dead on the floor !? 5. Small 24 hour store has had so many thefts that when you walk in they literally follow you around the store as if your going to steal something ! 6. Area that this Motel 6 is in is a Dump and the lot next to it is abandoned and filed with porn advertisement and a million broken bottles. 7. Walls are paper thin and i mean just normal talking levels are too loud as you can tell everything that is being said in the next room. 8. GRAND FINALE.... I'm taking a shower and my wife gets a call from front desk that the water is leaking into the room downstairs below me and i need to stop taking a shower and get put another room immediately. Then they say in the morning is fine as long as we don't shower anymore, well next morning i call to switch rooms and they say \"we don't know what your talking about\" !

We ask if we can leave our luggage at the bell desk until a room is available. They tell us \"NO\" we don't have a bell desk, but provide lockers for guests to store luggage. So we proceed all the way around the back of the building to the locker area (carrying about 8 bags) and put our .50 cents into 4 lockers (because they are so small) and of course the lockers don't open. So as we are trying to get our money out of the locker, the police walk up to ask if we have a problem. (Ok, so now we are criminals) We finally get someone from the front desk to come and help us out. We return to the hotel around 4 hours later and finally are able to check in. So the clerk gives us our keys and says \" just walk past the pool and it should be on your left\" Simple enough right? WRONG!! What she failed to tell us is that this particular property is divided by another motel called America's Best Value Inn. Our room ends up being two parking lots away from the lobby. This may not have been so bad, however, we are carrying 8 large bags because there are no luggage carts. Ok, finally find the room and of course, the keys do not work.

First of all, my friend and I checked in and it was close to midnight. The staff seemed nice and polite but when we checked into our room, it was a different story. While I looked around the room to make sure everything was nice, I went into the bathroom and found to my horror, pubic hair stuck onto the toilet seat. And yes, there was still urine in the toilet bowl! When I called to complain, the front desk lady said that she couldn't do aynthing but send in housekeeping to clean the room. At 12:00 midnight?? Yeah right, lady. I argued with her some more, letting her know that even if the bathroom was clean, who's to say that the rest of the room was clean too? Finally, she relented and let us change rooms. We had to go back to the front desk, ask for the other keys and finally we checked into our second room. The second room wasn't bad, it smelled like smokes but we chose a smoking section so it was fine with us. The second night though was horrible. We got locked out of our rooms, had to go back to the front desk and was told lies about my cell phone interfering with the key, thus not making it work. What a lie! First of all, my cell phone was no where near the key since I kept the key in my pocket and my cell in my handbag. While the guy was telling us that lie, the horrible lady (the girl that didn't want to change our rooms) was laughing at us but because this was around 5 in the morning, but I was so tired that I just didn't want to argue with her. We finally were able to check in our room and tried to sleep but the skeezy neighbors next to us were drinkin' and chatting and the walls are so thin, you could hear almost every word they were saying. The morning crew was the only good thing about this motel. They were so sweet and kind, especially the guy who got our room checked out.

Don't expect a clock radio, coffee maker, extra pillows or blankets, iron & ironing board, fridge, microwave, etc. They also skimp on the soap and clean towels. The hotel is wired for wifi, but you need to purchase a wifi card which gives you 24 hours of service for $2.99. That isn't bad, as many higher priced hotels charge at least $10.99. I am of the opinion that in these days and times wifi should be complimentary no matter where you stay or price you pay. It is a large spread out property, in which one section is currently(Nov '08) being renovated. A few of it's pluses include it's proximity to \"The Strip\". You can walk to the MGM Grand, Hooters, Tropicana, New York New York, and the Excalibur. It's also close to the MGM Grand Monorail Station. Even on a hot day of 100+ degree temperature (38+ celsius) you can easily walk to many of these hotels. There is a Cocos Restaurant next door, and a convenience store on the property. A major minus is that it's literally located across the street from McCarren Airport in close proximity to the runways. Now, I am a heavy sleeper. I live in California and have slept through earthquakes. Every morning without fail, I was awaken at 0600 by loud jet noise. To be fair to the motel, my room faced Koval Lane. Those rooms get the brunt of the noise from McCarren. When I stayed there before, I had a room on the opposite side of the motel, and airport noise wasn't a problem. At least it didn't wake me up every morning. All in all, it was a clean, cheap, and very basic room. I was only in the room long enough to take a shower, sleep, wake up, and leave for the day. It's good for a short stay. Las Vegas offers many activities to occupy your time. None of which includes sitting around your motel room. At the very least you can go out and enjoy the pool!!

We had to leave CC by 11:00 am and the check in time was 3pm at Motel 6. We had to sit in the lobby for 3 hours. They said the room was not ready and we could not check in. We asked if that room could be cleaned sooner since we were in the lobby waiting rather than a room with no one waiting on, but they said no. That did not make sense cleaning a room which was not even rented yet and making guests who have already paid wait 3 hours! Once we did get into the room, we were pleased at its cleanliness right off. The room was basic with a TV, one bed, desk, chair soap, towels and wash cloths. As far as accessibility went, it was more than adequate with room to move around, everything within reach and set up perfectly for wheelchair users. While the motel is not directly on the strip, it was no issue getting to the strip. In fact we went straight out our door to the outside, rather than having to go down an elevator, wind around through a crowded lobby and out the door. This actually made up for the distance being a bit farther to the strip. The small cafe next door has very good food. We ate breakfast there both mornings. Good food as well as good service at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend this motel to anyone who wants to save their money for what they come to Vegas for and that is usually for fun! It is perfect for wheelchair users as stated before. Families would get a good bargain hotel and a pool for the kids. Resist the temptation of the higher priced hotels on the Strip and stay here.

The rooms are basic, ours had two queen beds, TV with cable, bathroom with shower and enough space for suitcases etc. The motel is VERY big. From the road, the office is at the front. Directly behind this is the pool area which is very pleasant, large pool with loads of sun loungers. The rooms spread back in a row from this point and this goes back around a quarter of a mile. This is the East Wing Then, to the right as you look at it, there's a small convenience store and a cheapish restaurant. Behind this is a Best Western motel and to the right of that, more Motel 6 rooms; this is the West Wing. You have to cross the Best Western car park to get to the from the West Wing to the East Wing where the office, laundry and vending machines are. It's a couple of minutes walk. There is a smaller pool in the West Wing but it's right near the car park and only separated by some railings which you could see right through. There didn't seem to be anyone using it whilst I was there. We asked to be near the East Wing pool but were told it was full. These rooms seem to be the most popular and I don't think you'll get one if arriving after 2pm or on a weekend (like we did). As it was weekend, the motel was very busy and yes, some of the other guests looked a bit dodgy. I heard a group of young men talking about \"working some b*****s\", which I took to mean they were pimps. There was always at least one man hanging around the car park, waiting for his lady to finish work (if you know what I mean). That said, they never bothered us and I did NOT feel in any danger. I suppose they're just going about their business and don't want any hassle either. But, hey, this is Vegas, that kind of thing goes on everywhere so I don't suppose I should be shocked. They're probably more discrete in fancier hotels. There were security guards riding around in golf carts and bicycles all day and night too. They didn't look too tough but it was reassuring to see them keeping an eye on everyone's rooms and cars. GOOD POINTS: The location. It's 5 minutes by car from the strip. If you have a car, take my advice, go down Koval road rather than the strip - we sat in traffic for over an hour and only got as far as Paris Hotel. The rooms were clean (the bath looked a little worn but certainly not dirty) and attended to every day. We were about halfway down the West Wing (room 1127) and had no problems with noise from other guests. Durning the week it's very quet and you should have no difficulty parking right outside your room. It's cheap BAD POINTS: It's right under the flight path for helicopters and during the day, they go over frequently. Anything from every 30 minutes to about 6 per minute at times. This was not a problem at night though. It's too big - you can't just nip out got ice in your PJs because you have to walk over Best Western's car park to get to it. They could do with bigger laundry facilities. I was travelling around the west of the USA and had 6 weeks' worth of clothing. They have 2 machines and 2 dryers. This is just not enough for a large motel. In conclusion, this motel is fine for the money. It's clean, the staff are OK, the location is good (especially if you drive) and it's cheap.

I usually stay at one of the nicer hotels on the strip, but this time it was extremely expensive, so my friend recomended Motel 6. This motel is very clean. The rooms are small, but overall good for the Vegas lifestyle. We only used the room for sleeping, but there was a pool available as well. The only things is that there is no shampoo or conditioner, you may need to bring you own. Have fun.. Its only a 3 min walk to the new monorail behind the MGM.

It's a Motel 6!\u201d", "Author": "SFcatamount", "ReviewID": "UR3167214", "Content": "This place is not as bad as some of the reviews would suggest. Yes, the rooms are small, but I found them to be typical of a budget motel. After reading the reviews, I was expecting something the size of a cruise ship's lower deck! But instead, it's just your average room with two doubles beds, a small desk/dresser combo, a TV, a nightstand, and not really much room for anything else. Not being a person who spends much time in the room except for sleeping, this suited me just fine. We had a room on the west wing (closest to the strip) and found the accomodations very clean and well kept. Housekeeping service was quick and efficient in keeping things tidy during our three-day stay there. One word of warning ... bring your own shampoo and lotion, because they don't provide the little bottles in the bathroom (only soap). If you have to buy these things in the quik-mart next door, they'll charge you an arm and a leg. For some reason, the shower felt like it was putting out carbonated water, with as much air as water, so it was not a place you'd want to linger ... but it was clean as well. The location is okay. It's a short walk to the MGM Grand across the street, but some of the darker corners of this large property are a little sketchy at night. We did see security officers in the parking lot at various times, which goes a long way in making you feel safer, and never encountered any problems. We always saw several tourists like ourselves making the same walk, no matter what time of the day or night. The Hotel San Remo is at the next block over, and if you like this location, you may also want to check into prices at America's Best Value Inn, which oddly is situated right in-between the two wings of Motel 6 and looks like the same level of accomodations. The Carrow's/Coco's restaurant on site was convenient and decent for breakfast, but like many places near the strip, was overpriced for what you got. If you book this place, just remember it's a \"budget\" motel ... no shampoo, shoe polish, or even Kleenex are supplied here ... but it's not a \"ghetto\" motel by any means!", "Date": "February 7, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Motel 6 Las Vegas - Tropicana", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d114906-Reviews-Motel_6_Las_Vegas_Tropicana-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html", "Price": "$45 - $74*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">195 East Tropicana Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Las Vegas</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NV</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">89109</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515851", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c8/1c/c81c601752de1b0c6f191303617cc8051large.jpg"}}
