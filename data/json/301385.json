{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Truely amazing Hotel The Prince Sakura Tower Hotel, was one of the best hotels i have stayed in during my travels watching Manchester United around Europe. and the USA, and South Africa.The staff were all amazing, and helped me a lot during my recent stay there, i needed some medicine, and they drove me to the hospital, stayed with me., and made sure i was treated quickly, and even arranged for an interpretor for me, all at no extra charge.I would recommend this Hotel to everyone, and the location is simply superb, about 3-4 mins walk from Shinagawa station, which links direct to Naritta Airport, and the best metro lines to get to all the best places in Tokyo.You will not be dissapointed.James Mortimer", "Date": "Dec 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR733730516", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "unitedfroever"}, {"Content": "Good experience, Bad experience The good:The Prince Sakura Tower Hotel in Tokyo is a beautiful hotel with spatious rooms. It is connected to two other sister hotels by a gorgeous, well-kept, traditional Japanese garden. Between the three hotels, the amenities are endless--twelve restaurants, two swimming pools, a spa, a sauna, a hot tub, and gift shops. Each room has a jet tub with a separate shower, a refrigerator with a snack bar, terry cloth and cotton (kimona-type) robes, and gift bag for each person which contains shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath salts, toothbrush and toothpaste, hairbrush, and bath gel.The bad:If you have a tattoo, which I have, you can't use the hot tub, swimming pools or sauna. It is strictly forbidden. The restaurants charge between $8-$12 for a cup of coffee. A simple sandwich is $20. Dinners are prix fixe, and they range in price from $50-$200 a person, depending which restaurant you want to eat in. I had a tempura dinner for $50 in one of the restaurants, and, although the food was good, two days later, I had the same meal in the Electric City area of Tokyo for $7. Unless you are coming with thousands to spend on food, you will need to plan to eat places outside of the hotel, and there are not a lot of restaurants in this area of Tokyo.If I return to Tokyo, I will not stay in this hotel again, simply because I can't use the sauna, pool, or hot tubs. The hotel itself was beautiful, the rooms were lovely, and the staff was thoughtful and kind (spoke very little English, though),", "Date": "Jul 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR269836101", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MaryVTexas"}, {"Content": "Wonderful Hotel, Best Possible Staff My colleagues in Tokyo booked this hotel for me and I am grateful they did! The room was amazing: much larger than I expected with a panoramic view of the city, a huge jacuzzi-tub with separate shower, and an enormous and very comfortable bed.

So here's a list...The Good:Fabulous views of the Tokyo skyline THE most comfy and enormous bed (we reckoned room for five, although we didn't test that theory!)Great bathroom - shower, nice deep bath, double sinks, separate toilet complete with plenty of buttons (very Japanese) Great location near Shinagawa station which means you can get anywhere very easily (never took a taxi the whole time we were there) You can also use the facilities in the two adjoining hotels - Takanawa Prince and New Takanawa - including business rooms, breakfast, restaurants etc etcVery friendly and helpful staff - nothing was too much trouble to sortYou get rewarded for being environmentally friendly - like big hotels these days, there's the usual request to reuse towels, which considering the number you're given is certainly no hardship. In return you get a voucher to spend in the hotel's shops/bars/restaurants - as I try to do that anyway, you get to feel virtuous and get rewarded. (Even if you opt for this, they change the linen on check-in/Check-out and every other day anyway, in case anyone is worried about cleanliness standards.)The OK (certainly not bad though!)Room service was good but not desperately cheap, but it's so easy to eat out it probably won't matter. Same goes for breakfast - fine but nothing to get wildly excited about (good coffee though)The wine bar wasn't the most happening place - we checked partly for the novelty (made a change from sake and beer) - but as we were spending our vouchers (see above) it was a freebie anyway.The bad:Nothing. Honest. I genuinely can't think of anything I'd change. (Well, unless they could make it free - but compared to hotel prices in other big cities, like London, it's a bargain for what you get)", "Date": "Feb 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR883391774", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "email_queenLondon"}, {"Content": "Nicest rooms of any hotel we have stayed at in Japan Thanks to numerous business trips to Japan over the last 5 years I have gotten a good sampling of hotels in the country. When my girlfriend and I decided to celebrate my 50th birthday in Tokyo, we naturally picked the Sakura Tower as it is the only one (including several in the Prince chain) that I can't say anything negative about. I always get a south facing king size western style room on the 10th, 12th or 14th floor and can't review any of the other room styles. These rooms are really big by Japanese standards and the bed could comfortably sleep a family of 5. Furniture is high quality matching solid maple. Bathroom has both a large tub and frameless glass enclosed shower. Toilet is the popular Toto with the usual array of electronic buttons on the seat. Everything is impeccably clean.We find the location very convenient as the Shinagawa station across the street has Narita Express to the airport, Shinkansen to Nagoya / Kyoto and Yamanote line to the rest of Tokyo. Getting to the nightlife in Rapongi requires either a train change at Ebisu or a $15 cab ride.The staff is very helpful. If there is no taxi outside the front door, the doorman will sprint down the drive to fetch one from the train station. My girlfriend was new to Japanese money and accidently got shortchanged when buying Yen at the front desk. They caught the error in their nightly audit and immediately sent a bellgirl up to our room with a note of apology and a request to come back to collect the rest of her money. If your Japanese is no better than mine, the the front desk is happy to phone for dinner reservations on your behalf or write street addresses in Kanji for the taxi drivers.", "Date": "Aug 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR373215103", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "esh023"}, {"Content": "\u93c3\u30e6\u6e70\u6434\ue15e\u6e4c\u9287\u5c7b\u4e97\u9288\u5a3f\u4f28\u9287?#x201d;
