We had even paid extra to secure a suite for us. Unfortunately, this hotel fell short on every front. When we first arrived at the hotel, it was clear that it was not a \"nice\" hotel--for example, there are stairs that force you to pick up and carry your luggage to the hotel's foyer. The elevator was small, with dingy mirrors lining the wall, and seemed to have mechanical difficulties. Even the lock seemed to barely work. Inside the room--it was clear that the suite hadn't been renovated in 30 years or so. There was tacky and peeling black-and-gold paint everywhere, more of the permanently stained mirrors, wooden shutters with missing locks, etc. The carpet and cloth furniture looked in desperate need of replacing or at least a steam cleaning. The bed was not kingsize as advertised but a queen--and the mattress hard and inexpensive. The TV and sattelite barely worked, requiring to press buttons hard. In the room itself, there was an aging jacuzzi with a 30-year old Whirlpool logo. The original jacuzzi controls were broken, and the hotel's staff showed us how to control it from the circuitbreaker--basically just \"on\" and \"off\" settings; basically unusable. The suite had a second room, but we just used it to store our luggage (which we were afraid to do at first, the room looked like a magnet for bed bugs). Inside the second room was a dingy and nasty mini bar. We kept the windows closed at night, but were subjected to mosquito bites--not surprising given the broken window latches and lack of screens. There was no safe in the room, and the advertised \"safe at the concierge\" meant leaving your stuff in a mailbox, not the most reassuring measures for your valuables. The thermostat was broken and off by at least 10 degrees. The bathroom seemed ok until we discovered that the toilet flusher was broken, requiring to press the button multiple times to activate the water. Included breakfast was ok and featured cold cuts, cereal, pasteurized cheese / jam, and hardboiled eggs--not bad. However, we found dinner to be a terrible experience--extremely overpriced, with mediocre food, and terrible live lounge music. A big pet peeve was the absence of WIFI or internet connectivity. The hotel forces you to buy a pay-per-use card, but the WiFi signal is too weak to access in the rooms. A kicker is that you have to use the pay-per-use card even to use the hotel's own computer in the lobby. The lobby computer was extremely old and ran Windows 98. In closing, this hotel is in a nice location by the Vatican and Castel Saint Angelo. However, the hotel itself is a terrible value and is in desperate need of complete and total repair.

As we pushed open the old weather worn authentic shutters we were rewarded with an uniterrupted view of St Peters Basillica, we could hear the bells of a morning [ but they didnt wake us].

The vatican is 5 minute walk - the Tiber is a 7 minute walk.

Roberta (manager) - awesome\u201d", "Author": "sburca", "ReviewID": "UR95923657", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Atlante Star on Dec 20-23. We booked through Priceline, so our price for a 4 star hotel was unbeatable. However, sometimes being a Priceline bidding customer comes at a price. A 4 star hotel in Europe is NOT a 4 star hotel in the USA. Not even CLOSE!! I'm not talking about the size of the rooms only (which we were aware of being MUCH smaller), but the amenities and quality of the rooms / bathrooms. When we first checked in, the front desk wanted to charge us a whopping 40 euros PER NIGHT for our child ,7 yr old (we paid less than $80 USD for the room initially!!!). We told him she'd sleep with us on the same bed, but he said it doesn't matter, as my child would still be using water from the shower, soap, and flush the toilet!!! Whoa .... there was no way I was going to settle for this kind of crap, so I asked for a manager. He didn't want to get one, so I made noise, so that the other customers in line could hear the absurdity. I didn't want to sound like an obnoxious American, but this was ridiculous. Our room was already paid for in advance. That's when Roberta (the manager) came into play, and everything from there on was as smooth and pleasant as it should've been from the very beginning. She apologized for the idiot at the front desk, moved us to a room with 1 double and 1 twin beds at no extra charge, and gave us free breakfast our last day of stay (the breakfast was AMAZING... great local produce, and super fresh). BTW, no breakfast included (or a 30 EURO charge per person (sigh) per day, quote by yours truly, the idiot at the front desk) and no free WiFi (super expensive to purchase as well!). But two doors down, at the cafe / sandwich shop, there is free WiFi (but be courteous and purchase something from them if you want to use their internet!!!) :) Worth mentioning: we stayed at a different 4 star hotel 2 week prior to this, in Rome, near Roma Termini, Hotel Morgana, and full breakfast was included every day, price per night was cheaper than Hotel Atlante Star, and had a lot more rooms remodeled MUCH NICER, and having a child with us was not even an issue at all! Just saying ... there are other options out there. The hotel and room we stayed in were clean and with nice decor. Although, not all rooms were created equally, we have seen 2 others. So it depends if you get one of the more recently upgraded rooms. The bathroom was not so great. Mold everywhere in the shower, clogged sink, lime & grit on the faucet preventing water from flowing without splashing everywhere, crackling pipes, whistling faucet, low water pressure in the shower ... The location was excellent, a few blocks away from the Vatican, and within walking distance to some of the most impressive sites in Rome (too many to list here, now). Walking so much around the area was GREAT! The hotel is small, everything is tight, but clean. This is Europe after all, but that's fine, for it made a very cozy stay. The elevator fits 2 people with 2 luggage, or 2 adults and 1 child, nose to nose. :) Yes, very small!! I didn't mind the closeness to my husband and child, but if this was a business trip and if I had to smell someone's breath that close ... I don't know! We used the stairs when we didn't have to carry the luggage. There is no pool or spa or jacuzzi or fitness center on the property. No lobby bathroom, only in rooms. Old / dirty bed sheets, as they were doing room service each day, would ALL sit in the small and narrow hallways, in HUGE piles, from morning until the wee hours at night, blocking several rooms on each level, and stairway or elevator access! Bottom line: in comparison to a 4 star hotel in the US or nordic EU countries, this hotel is an average 2 (two) star hotel at best. The only reason I gave this rating a 4 star, is because Roberta really did everything she could, ABOVE and BEYOND, to make up for the front desk idiot (who was upset that she treated us so nicely!!!) and rooms.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cWhat a disappointment!\u201d", "Author": "MaltaBear", "ReviewID": "UR95547358", "Content": "Booked this hotel through Priceline.

We reported this to reception and they sent a man up to fix it, but it didnt resolve the problem and we could only use the shower if we held the hose in a certain position. The rooftop garden and restaurant were a building site and we were not told that they were not available at checkin. Breakfast was in another hotel entirely and it was very annoying to have to walk 10minutes just to get breakfast in the morning. The walls of the rooms were cotton thin. You could hear everything that was going on next to you - and as a result we were kept awake by other residents. It was a loud room and side road but we took that to be a sign of \"authentic rome\".

Breakfast was typical -- charge was 15 Euros if not included in your rate. Internet in the room (corded) worked fine (10 Euros for an eight-hour pass, 5 Euros for three hours). The hotel is in an excellent location for visitors -- quick walk to St. Peter's and about a 15-minute walk to the Metro. ATM is located right outside the building. A small supermarket is about a block away. We'd also recommend the Porto Costello Ristorante for lunch or dinner. It's a block away (exit the hotel and go left to Largo di Porta Castello, 27).

Pillows a bit hard, bed had some rough spots too, Sat TV was nice and helped keep me up on that dang volcano that changed my plans for the week...But as they always say, you don't spend much time in the room... The restaurant was a bit over priced for what I ended up getting (dinner)...but I had just arrived that night and not ready to venture out too far, but my company paid for it, so no skin out of my pocket... Breakfast was not bad, but they could have done a better job restocking the buffet, as the selection seemed sparse and that was around the mid point through the breakfast period. But the view is pretty awesome, but to me, not worth spending my or my compay's $'s for a view that you can see by walking a few blocks and for \"just OK\" food... The best thing about the Atlante Star was the location. I found EVERYTHING within walking distance from this hotel. The first morning I took off and headed to St. Peter's, then to the Spanish Steps, the Trevi Fountain, The Pantheon, a quick fly through Piazza Navonna, then back the Vatican Museum for my afternoon tour. The next day I headed over to ancient Rome, the Forum, Colusseum, Circus Maximus, and then back to the hotel to rebook flights and change business meetings around the volcano, then took a Hop on Hop Off Bus tour to see what I might have missed. I took advantage of the transportation for Euro 40 or so back to FCO, which is what a taxi costs, so that was worth it too...and is a great service that the hotel offers. I am considering another trip to Rome and even with the room experience, I haven't disqualified this hotel yet from being a possibility on that trip.

First the positives: Great location! 3 minute walk from the Vatican and within a half hour walk from every other major tourist attraction in Rome. But Rome is a walkable city so this is probably true for most hotels. Suite was reasonably sized by European standards. Having said that, we did get a suite so I'm not sure what the standard rooms are like. Now the negatives: First, the hotel offers a free pick-up service and told us they'd be waiting with a sign when we arrived. They were two hours late picking us up! We were arriving from Canada after 2 flights and a total of 15 hours of travel on an overnighter, so waiting in the airport for 2 hours was about the last thing we needed. We called and they kept saying \"the driver will be there in 20 mintes.\" On the phone we were told that traffic was bad, which turned out to be untrue. In fact, the driver told us he had to wait to pick up passengers on a second incoming flight that arrived just as the driver arrived. The traffic was perfectly fine in both directions. Second, the beds are not comfortable.They are cheap mattresses and much less than I would expect from a four-star hotel. Third, the breakfasts are not great. Some boiled eggs, pastries, a bit of cheese, and yogurt. I have nothing to compare it to in Rome but we opted to eat out. Fourth, it's noisy! The hotel overlooks a busy street and the rooms facing the street get a lot of noise. If you are a light sleeper this is NOT the hotel for you! Finally, on our return trip to the airport the hotel offers a transfer for 40 Euros for 2 people. We should have learned our lesson from our pick-up experience, but instead we signed up for the hotel transfer. Because it was Good Friday, we booked a transfer to leave 3 before our flight. We got a call in our hotel room half an hour before we were to leave saying that the traffic was terrible and we had to leave early. So we rushed around to get all our stuff together and ran downstairs. The driver sped to the airport but there was no traffic at all. We asked why he was rushing and he told us that he had to pick up passengers from an incoming flight (probably people who had been waiting 2 hours for their pick-up!). We realized they lied to us about the reason for leaving early and were doing this for their own convenience, and not ours. In short, we would not stay at this hotel again nor would we recommend it.

We booked this hotel for 3 rooms on priceline. We had been driving throughout Italy but decided to return our rental cars early before we got to Rome. The hotel was kind enough to pick us up at the airport and bring us to the hotel. When we got to the Star I told them my reservations were at the Garden, their sister hotel. The desk clerk then told me that they had no hot water at the other hotel so we were switched here. I knew this was most likely untrue (and that was confirmed to me later on) since I have seen so many reviews of these 2 hotels switching people back and forth. We brought our luggage to the rooms and mine was very hot. I turned the ac on but it was so stifiling in there that I got on the bed to check the vents. Nothing. I told the front desk and they said a collegue would be up to fix it. The front desk clerk kept telling us about the wonderful restaurant on the top floor for dinner. Tired, and not wanting to go in search of a meal at 9 pm at night, we went up there. This was the biggest disappointment and costliest mistake of our trip. The food was expensive and bad. Only one of the 6 enjoyed their meal. The staff, upset at our attire, even though we asked the host if we should change and he said no, ignored us and was slow even by European standards. We ordered drinks with our dinner and didn't get them until we got the bill (we sent them back). I was sick the rest of the night and my husband was sick all morning. Upon returning to our room the ac was not fixed but a window was open. The front desk clerk, a new one, told us it was broken and there was nothing to be done as both hotels were fully booked (I guess the hot water was fine now huh?). He handed me a fan and said too bad. There were no outlets the fan could work in as both the plug and its adapter didn't fit anything inthe room. The room was on the first floor and facing the busy street. Between my husband and i we got 2 hours of sleep and roasted. I have never been so angry at a hotel in my life. The next day we were able to change rooms and that issue was solved. We were charged for the shuttle back to the airport the following day although they had originally told us it was free both ways. the barmaid, the hardest working person in the hotel, was excellent and pleasant even when being run ragged. The second night room change and the help with the shuttle from the airport is the only reason this hotel is not getting a lower mark. Go to the restaurant for the free breakfast but skip it for dinner.

The last night we called for a wake up call and the guy at the front desk never called us. I was prepared and set my cell phone to wake me up. This hotel is relying on the fact that they have a decent location near the vatican. I really think this adds to the poor service because they know they dont have to do much because people are going to book with them anyway. One good thing was breakfast on the 5th floor with a view but thats about it. Also the ROOF GARDEN IS CLOSED so dont book if you think your gonna go see a roof garden because your not.

Our stay was during the second week in July. We had a very nice view of St. Peter's Basilica from our room's balcony. The room was small, yet clean and cozy. Room service came in and provided clean towels each day, made the beds, and emptied the waste baskets. The hotel staff was friendly and the desk clerks were always helpful (the desk clerks spoke English very well). There are only 2 English TV channels (which you will find in most Italian hotels) - CNN International and BBC World. You also have the option to pay to view various movies (in your language of choice). High-speed internet access is available at this hotel. 3 euros for 1/2 an hour and 5 euros for 1 hour. Once you pay at the front desk, the clerk will give you a code to access the internet. You have the option to use your own laptop which can be connected to the cable in your room or you can use the computer in the lobby (which is connected to a printer that you can print to for free -- a plus!). Ask about charges for telephone use before you use it. I tried to use my calling card and was still charged but didn't find out until check-out. The bathroom was very clean, yet narrow. The shower head can be used as a hand-held or kept mounted. Instead of being mounted on the side wall, the shower head is mounted on the wall directly across from the shower curtain. Be sure to press the shower curtain against the sides so the water doesn't end up on the floor (a problem we had particularly during the first day of use) because of where the shower head is mounted. But we got use to it after that. Breakfast is served every morning from 7 to 10AM on the 6th floor. The breakfast room provides a great panoramic view of the city including St. Peter's Basilica. Breakfast included foods such as croissants (plain and jelly filled), rolls (regular and wheat), jelly, honey, sliced cheese and meat, three or 4 cereals to choose from along with milk, yogurt, fruit; and drinks such as orange juice, pineapple juice and water (naturale or frizzante). I only wished there had been a way to warm up the bread and croissants; and the juice didn't taste like the OJ and pineapple juice that I am used to drinking. One day we noticed that the pineapple juice tasted a little watered down. But other than that, everything was nicely laid out and provided a nice selection of breakfast items. There is a supermarket around the corner from the hotel. Make a left outside of the hotel's main doors. Make a left at the corner (where the hotel's restaurant is located) and then make a left at the next corner. The supermarket is on the other side of the same block as the hotel. Here, you can shop like the locals. We found the best deal on bottled water -- 27 cents a bottle. There is a mini bar in the room where you can squeeze a few bottles in to keep cold (the items in the bar are overpriced and you can purchase your own at the supermarket for a better deal). You will hear a lot of noise throughout the night if your room is on the main road (Via G. Vitelleschi) which faces the Basilica, but you'll get use to it. After all of the walking during the day, you will probably be so tired and will quickly fall asleep like I did and the noise didn't even matter. It seems like the trash pick-up is done late at night which may be responsible for the majority of the noise. We got a great rate on this room because we stayed for 4 days. When you book in advance for 3 days or more, you receive 25% off your entire stay. The hotel is in a great location in Trastevere between Vatican City and Castel St. Angelo. These two attractions are in walking distance. The closest metro station is Occtaviano which allows you to reach other major attractions. Although the station isn't nearby, it's a nice walk down Via Occtaviano (maybe 15 minutes) which is filled with clothing and food shops. It may take you longer to get to the metro if you like to window shop. Stop by the Blue Ice gelateria for a nice gelato.

The hotel is fairly uninspiring from the outside and could do with a refresh. Location wise this hotel is ideal as it is about a 5-10 minute walk to St Peter's square and the Vatican, and not much more than 30 mins walk to even the furthest of the central attractions. It is a little away from the main tourist strips meaning you don't feel hassled the moment you step out of the hotel. The location is really what you are paying for. The room itself was a real disappointment. We had booked a 'superior double', but am not sure how this differed to the standard room. First of all we were given a twin room, but the hotel did change that for a double when we asked. The rooms are very dark, meaning we had to have all the lights on whenever we were in the room. Our room was pretty small for a four star hotel, with none of the amenities you might expect like a room safe, robes or tea and coffee making facilities. The decor was not to our tastes and looks a little tired in places, it also adds to the feeling of a dark small room. The bathroom was adequate, though the toilet was a little close to the sink. The bath is probably too small for most people to comfortably have a bath in. The shower over the bath is good, although it is very easy to drench the entire bathroom in water whilst using it. We couldn't get the Sky to work, though admittedly didn't try very hard. The air conditioning was good, not too noisy and easy to control. Our room had a small balcony overlooking the unattractive back of the hotel. It had a table and single chair, along with some long dead window boxes. Fine if you had wanted to smoke, but not somewhere we wanted to spend any time. The views from the restaurant are excellent, probably the best part of the hotel. Breakfast is served up there which is a fairly standard continetal breakfast - fine but not outstanding. As many other reviewers have commented, the roof garden is closed until October. A real shame as the views would be spectacular, and a little dishonest that the hotel still hasn't updated its website to reflect this. You can use the roof garden at the Atlante Garden - we would suggest you don't bother, there are not really any views and there is no bar up there. Overall, the hotel is a little tired in places but is in a good location and has spectacular views from the restaurant. However, it is overpriced for what it is and we found the room a real disappointment. I would say it was a good 3 star, lower end of four star hotel and would be a good bet if it was priced accordingly. Unfortunately it is not and we wouldn't stay again - even at the \"discounted\" rate of \u00a3180 per night we felt we were overcharged for what we got.", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "uk", "Title": "\u201cIDEAL LOCATION - EXCELLENT SERVICE - VERY EXPENSIVE\u201d", "Author": "rangeview", "ReviewID": "UR30028404", "Content": "When you arrive at the Atlante Star Hotel, the first thing to strike you is the location rather than the look. Situated within a few minutes' walk of St Peters Basilica and the Vatican, there are few quality hotels in Rome that can boast such an idyllic proximity to almost everything. The exterior of the building is rather tired and would benefit from a facelift. Once inside though the splendour and quality of this hotel become clearly evident, although it is compact. Space is at a premium in central Rome so this is hardly surprising. Rooms all vary in size, but the decor is splendid and recently updated. Some of the larger rooms are very opulent, and if you have a choice then a 4th or 5th floor room overlooking St Peters is a must. A few have small balconies, which allow you to stand outside and enjoy the hustle bustle of Rome street life. For the light sleepers who prefer to sleep with the window/door open the noise outside may be a distraction, although this is only really relevant in the rooms at the front of the hotel. Those to the side and back are much quieter, although do not offer the classic Roman views. Rooms are climate controlled, though the effectiveness of these systems is doubtful and may become a problem in the height of summer. May is an idyllic time to visit Rome as the weather and temperatures are perfect. The most extraordinary feature of the Atlante Star is the top floor restaurant which has majestic and breathtaking views over Rome, most notably St Peters and the Vatican. The breakfasts are well presented with hot hard boiled eggs being the only addition to a traditional continental breakfast. The restaurant is also open to the public for dinner and has an apparently excellent reputation although we didn't eat there as there are thousands of lovely restaurants around the city, many within a few minutes' walk. Meal prices are generally good, although it does pay to look around and check the menus before committing as a few restaurants may charge significantly higher prices. The service in the Atlante Star is excellent, as they work hard to make your stay a pleasant one. We judge hotels by how they respond to problems, rather than whether they are perfect all the time. The Atlante Star is a high quality, smart and excellently positioned hotel that really responds to the typical minor hiccups any stay will have. The only real criticism of this hotel is regarding the price as rooms can exceed 400 Euros a night, which is high wherever you are in the world. Negotiate with the reservations department and they are often flexible enough to offer discounted and group rates. Beware though that the sister hotel, the Atlante Garden, which is just a block away, is far inferior in every way to the Star. It may be classified as 4 Star but certainly is not, and more like 2 or 3 Star. Some guests are placed in the Garden Hotel when they think they have booked into the Star, so ensure you confirm where your room is located when booking. The only thing the Garden has are larger rooms for small families, so if the hotel can only locate you in the Garden insist on eating breakfast in the Star to enjoy the spectacular view. Finally a few minor words of warning: firstly, the roof terrace on the Atlante Star is closed for refurbishment until October 2009. This is a real shame as the views are almost certainly second to none in Rome. The Garden has a roof terrace but the views are very limited. Secondly, the hotel website for the Atlante Garden uses many photos from the Atlante Star which is very misleading and can wreck expectations if you have decided to stay in the slightly cheaper Atlante Garden. Thirdly and finally, the hotel does offer a free transfer from FCO airport (and not any other Rome airport), but will charge 42 Euros (for 1 passenger) and 48 Euros (for 2 passengers) for the return leg. If you do not want to use the good underground and rail service to the airport then this option is quite expensive, albeit convenient. In conclusion, the Atlante Star hotel is excellent in almost all areas and could not be better positioned for access to many marvellous sights, restaurants and bars. The price is quite steep, although this IS Rome and one of the most wonderful cities in the World, so 'nothing comes for nothing' in this day and age. Treat yourselves to one of the top floor suites overlooking St Peters and the rest of Rome, and when the roof terrace is open, relax in the open air with panoramic views of the whole of Rome and suck in the atmosphere and history of such a marvellous city.

We'd hoped to have someone more animated - and at least bilingual - to point out all the areas we transited. At reception, they had our room ready early - before 10am - which was a tremendous gift, we'd had almost no sleep on the 9hr flight. The room was newly decorated - in black/brown/grey tones - which made the small room seem even tinier. There was a quite comfortable king bed, with a window which opened - to a noisy street below. Horns and sirens could be heard all night long, even with windows closed. The bathroom was big enough for only 1 person at a time - with a shower \"door\" which swung both ways over the tub, making for a watery mess every time the shower was used. BIG UPSIDE- breakfast was served in the rooftop ENCLOSED dining room. There were plenty of choices - meats, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit with delicious croissants and coffee - overlooking a skyline full of Rome's rooftops, including St Peter's Basilica, the view was breathtaking!

Risorgimento you'll find a terrific little pizzeria where you order by the piece from a dozen tempting varieties. The sun encouraged us in late November to lunch at an outdoor table. The hotel is between Castel S. Angelo and St. Peter's. Just around the corner to Via Porta Castello (becomes Borgo Pio) leads straight to St. Peter's. You'll pass past two great little trattorias, where you'll want to return for lunch or dinner: La Pancia Felice (the Happy Tummy) and Arlu` at Borgo Pio, 135. Buffet breakfast is a highlight at the Atlante Star. You'll look out over the dome of St. Peter's and enjoy a huge variety of rolls, croisants, coffee cakes, cheese, cold cuts, fruit and juices, and more. The restaurant, Les Etoiles, serves lunch and dinner in this gorgeous room at the top of the hotel and at the outdoor terrace and bar in warm weather. We didn't spring for the lofty prices but would be tempted for a special celebration. Comfy beds, great location, wonderful staff.

The position is great for Vatican only. All other sights are the bus,train or taxi away. when we arrived i felt a little dissapointed at the outside appearance of the hotel, it seemed like it needed a little maintenance, there was scaffolding up at the buildings next to it, which didn't help the appearance. The area seems a little run down, with a lot of graffiti on some buildings. which is a shame as it is in a prime position. The staff were friendley enough,but the rooms weren't ready when we arrived and we had to wait about an hour. The rooms were the standard rooms, the decor was nice,with an Italian feel to them, with shuttered windows. The bathrooms were small, a little tired, but clean. The bath and shower, although quaint, was a nightmare, it seemed impossible to have a shower without getting water everywhere! The view from the restaurant is great of the Basilica, but the rooftop garden was locked and when we asked if we could go there, we were told, no! The breakfast on our visit was to be honest, substandard, very little choice and quantity. I wouldn't say I was fussy, my opinion does seem to contradict other reviews i,ve read. But the breakfast I thought was below the standard of a basic hotel like Travel lodge, say. The restaurant at night was ridiculously priced-\u00a380, average price for a main meal! Yes, \u00a380 per person, for one main meal! Well over priced for an average hotel! You are paying well over the odds for the view from the restaurant. Our trip was great, and Rome is a great place to visit, but I feel the hotel has ideas of gran'deur, it is pleasant, but I rate it as average.

We wanted a family room as we were travelling with our 2 children aged 9 and 12. Having checked the hotel's website and other reviews we booked up the trip. Now we've been there, I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Rome. The reception staff were extremely courteous and helpful and the hotel was very clean. We had a suite on the first floor with a room for the children and a separate room for the adults with a shared bathroom. The accommodation was very comfortable and ideal for our needs. The view from our room was into a typical Rome side street and fine for the amount of time we spent in the room. The breakfast room has stunning views of St. Peter's basilica which took my breath away. We were early to breakfast each morning to make the most of our stay but also to ensure a table overlooking St Peter's.The choice and quality of the buffet breakfast was good but we didn't eat dinner in the restaurant as it was a bit beyond our budget. (The road Borgo Pio is lined with independantly owned restaurants which provided good value Italian fare and is only a couple of streets away from the hotel.) Location, location, location!! The hotel is within easy walking distance of Piazza San Pietro, the Vatican and Castel Sant Angelo. During our stay it was great to be able to stroll to Piazza San Pietro whenever we fancied it to soak up the atmosphere. We found it easy to get around Rome by bus to see the sights returning to Piazza San Pietro and a short stroll back to the hotel. The hotel has a car park but it's quite pricey at 40euros per day. This reflects how difficult it can be to find a parking place on the streets in the centre of Rome. With a bit of patience however we were able to park on the surrounding streets and paid less for parking for the whole trip than it would have cost for one night in the hotel car park. As the hotel offers transfers to and from the airport and the public transport is so good you only need to rent a car if you want to venture outside Rome.

On arrival however, there was a problem with the availability of rooms at the Atlante Garden so we we were sent to it's sister hotel, the Atlante Star. Despite our initial disappointment, we had a wonderful stay. Our room on the second floor was comfortable and well appointed. The housekeeping staff are meticulous about hygiene and cleanliness. Breakfast is served in the \"Les Etouilles\" restaurant located on the top floor with its breathtaking 360 degree views over St. Peter's Basilica and Rome. The range of foods available for breakfast each was quite extensive - bacon and scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, cold meats, cheeses, yoghurts, fresh fruit and a good range of tinned fruits, a range of cereals, various bread rolls and preserves, croissants, chocolate pains, danish pastries and various tarts etc. and the usual fruit juices, tea, coffee, mineral waters. I, myself, am Coeliac and have to follow a medically prescribed gluten-free diet. I had e-mailed the Atlante Garden before my visit to ensure that they could cater for me. This information was passed to the Atlante Star and the hotel went out to great lengths to ensure that I had a good supply of gluten-free bread during my stay. We also had an excellent evening meal in the restaurant - again carefully prepared by the chef. This restaurant is very popular because of it's breathtaking views - ensure you book before-hand! This hotel is extremely close to the Vatican - a plus if you want to get there early to avoid the queues to get in to the basilica, the Sistene Chapel and the museums. It is also very close to all bus routes and the metro, enabling you to get right around the tourist sites such as the Trevi fountain, Spanish Steps etc. On our last day, my husband had the misfortune of having his wallet stolen while in one of the shops in St. Peter's square. It was a professional job by three individuals - he was aware of it happening while it was taking place but was powerless to do anything about it. Fortunately, as we were only killing time waiting for our airport transfer they didn't get much in the way of cash but there were a couple of credit cards in the wallet that needed to be cancelled immediately. We went straight back to the hotel and the management immediately took charge and helped us to contact the credit card agencies.

Roberta, who is the daughter of the owner, was the manager that we encountered the most and couldn't have been more pleasant, and really went out of her way to help us. My Dad wanted to golf in Italy, and she looked up and printed out golf courses in the area, etc. for us. We had a Junior Suite on the fourth floor. The best part about it was the view! It overlooked the Vatican. Doesn't get much better than that in Rome. The fourth/fifth floors definitely have that view if you are on the street side. The third floor may also have the view as well. The rooms appear to have all been recently renovated. Wood floors, new wall coverings, small flat screen tv's, etc. The neighborhood around the hotel had gelato shops, grocery stores, small restaurants, and a main street of shopping including a department store called \"Coin.\" We also ate at Les Etoiles one evening which is rated in the top ten restaurants in Rome according to many magazines/guides. The view again, overlooks the Vatican, which is beautifully lit at night. The garden terrace was closed during our stay, but apparently you have a 360 degree view of Rome from that rooftop. It would seemingly be a great place for a wedding and/or reception. Basics in the room such as air conditioning, water temperature, etc. all worked great. There is traffic noise, but when both shutters/windows are closed it really minimizes that. The housekeeping staff were all very friendly, and the bell men were helpful and efficient. There is internet access for a small fee in the reception area, and normally there was never many people using it. One of the greatest aspects of this hotel was the downstairs lounge.

This was an improvement, but had twin beds - when we asked for a double the hotel reassured us that they would move us again. When we returned to the hotel later in the day, we found that we were in the same room and that they had just pushed the beds together. Unfortunately this room was also very 'tired' and greatly in need of refurbishment. Plug sockets were hanging off the walls and there was a hole in one wall where cables had been run through it. As the reception staff hadn't made it very easy for us to move rooms, we decided not to ask to move rooms again and just to try and spend as little time in the hotel as possible. The hotel was advertised as four star, but was anything but. Breakfast was quite nice, though the coffee was often cold if you went there for the earlier part of service. Service was mediocre, communal spaces as tired as bedrooms and the roof garden - our main reason for choosing the place as it offered a panoramic view of St. Peter's Basilica and Vatican City - was out of bounds due to repairs. Before making our booking we did check the hotel's own website. On the site the roof garden featured as the hotel's prime selling point.

The hotel restaurant and terrace are also excellent and have great views of the city and Vatican. The breakfast and evening meal menus are ample and compliment the hotel very well. Staff at the hotel are very polite are very helpful no matter what was asked or requested. And the main thing my wife and I noticed was that for an inner city location, the hotel was very quiet and we had no trouble sleeping.

We stayed at the Hotel Atlante Star in Rome which I had booked primarily because it was one of the few hotels in Rome offering quadruple rooms and complimentary pick up service at the airport. I read some mixed reviews on the hotel after booking so didn't really know what to expect. I sent our travel details to the hotel before leaving the US for pick up and their response was immediate with instructions on where to find the driver who was ready and waiting for us. Our family room was charming - a small suite including a room with two twins, bathroom and room with a queen bed. The beds were very comfortable with high quality linens and the flat screen TV with lots of English stations was a plus at night after long hours of walking all through Rome. The staff was professional, helpful and friendly at all times. The location of the hotel is great - a couple of blocks from St. Peters and the Vatican, a couple of blocks from one of the bridges to central Rome and very close to a street with lots of great family friendly restaurants. We never took a cab anywhere and for those who don't like to walk, public transportation is close by and the front desk gives great directions.The breakfast buffet was wonderful with everything from pastries and breads,fruit and juices, cereals, eggs, meats, coffee and more. The view of Saint Peters from the breakfast room is breathtaking - the hotel website does not do it justice. We stayed on the concierge floor of a Marriott after leaving Rome which was comfortable, predictable and very American (not a bad thing) but we all agreed that our stay in the Atlante Star was the highlight of the trip and gave us more of a flavor for Rome.

We found the reception staff helpful and there was generally a friendly atmosphere.

There are also some excellent local trattorias / pizerrias within walking distance. Just avoid anything on the main square or on a road adjacent to the Vatican. The general rule is that the best (certainly best value) places are tucked down the side streets. There are plenty of them. A few things about the hotel we'd recommend noting. Firstly, some of the rooms face the main street and are bound to be very noisy - we heard two other families complaining. We asked for a quiet room on booking and again on check-in and the one we had was fine. Strongly suggest anyone else does the same. Secondly, if you haven't booked with breakfast included, don't be tempted to eat in the hotel. It is 15 euros each (which they don't tell you until afterwards), which is a complete rip off for what is no more than a modest continental selection. There are lots of good cafes / bakeries where you can get a better beakfast for a fraction of the cost - including one in the street opposite. However, don't let the above put you off - the hotel is fine, paritcularly when you see some of the alternatives and you remember that as an ancient city which needs to make little effort to continue to attract tourists (and frankly doesn't !), you are never likely to get a gem for a bargain basement price or anything remotely modern anywhere near the city centre.", "Date": "April 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cPlease Do Not Stay Here - Far Better Options Out There!!!!\u201d", "Author": "noraspence", "ReviewID": "UR14963472", "Content": "On arrival we were taken to what we assume was an overspill from the hotel, some 70 yards or so down the road and not part of the actual hotel that we appeared to have booked.

As my jaw dropped further and further the manager assured me that if we were unhappy with the accommodation we could move... We were walked to an anonymous building about 5 minutes away and taken into a ground floor apartment - there were stains on the paper, the lavatory seat was cracked and the sofa bed made up for our children was broken underneath. My son shut himself in the cupboard and cried. I immediately asked to be moved but was told that there were no other rooms. We were promised a quad for the next night but, interestingly, the manager flatly refused to show us the room.

Our two adults and a child were accommodated in a suite, with a double bed in one area and closing door through to a single bed in another area. The decor was delightful, calming, and welcoming - in the room and throughout the hotel. Breakfast buffet included, as mentioned before it is situated on the top floor with exceptional views. This is compounded by the location ... just a five minute stroll to The Vatican walls, to St Peters and a 10 minute stroll through gorgeous pedestrian friendly streets to Castel Sant'Angelo. I cant praise this hotel enough ... we were very sad to go. If you can I strongly recommend crossing the road for a dinner extravaganza that is La Barca restaurant (the hotel staff will make reservations for you).

We had booked this hotel for our last two nights in Rome. The entrance to the hotel was a steep narrow flight of stairs. While the men at the front desk watched, we struggled to get our bags up the stairs into the lobby! The hallways to the rooms were narrow and dark. There were construction workers working right outside of our rooms and we had to climb underneath their ladders and manuever our luggage around tool boxes and piles of construction material to even get to into our rooms! We had a terrible time getting the locks on the doors to work properly. The doors themselves, were hollow and flimsy and when they were shut and locked you could see light through the chewed up door jams. When we entered the rooms they were dark and dingy and it was even an effort to get the shutters to open properly to let light and fresh air in. When I went to the front desk to tell them that I was very disappointed in the rooms and they were nothing like the pictures advertised on the Atlante Star website, I was sarcastically told \"I shouldn't assume that the rooms are going to look like those pictures!\" I told him about our trouble with the locks and asked to see any other available rooms. He gave me the keys to 4 other rooms on 3 different floors, all of which either smelled like dead fish or vomit, or faced the garbage dumpsters so we wouldn't want to open the shutters. We stayed in the original two rooms and later that night found out that the air conditioner was broken in one of the rooms. (It was 90 degrees outside and they brought up a fan to re-circulate the air) If that wasn't enough, we found a huge cock-a-roach running across the bedroom floor and the shower sprayer kept falling on us as we tried to shower! I called Hotels.com and told them we were not staying the second night. They said they would refund the 2nd nights' stay. The next morning when we checked out we, once again, struggled to get our luggage down the flight of stairs without any help from the staff, even though they stood and watched from the windows in the lobby. We were lucky enough to find a wonderful hotel in which to spend our last night in Rome, the Hotel Pace Elvezia, but unfortunately that wasn't the case for a woman who approached us outside of the Atlante Star. She asked us if we were given the rooms we had paid for. She said she was not. As mentioned in some of the reviews on this website, she paid for a room in the hotel and when she arrived she was sent to an apartment down the block because there were no rooms available in the main hotel.

We look forward to sitting by the window, looking out to the Vatican City, smelling fresh flowers on our table and just soak-up the ambiance of here and now. The entire experience was so romantic. Definitely a place to fall-in-love if you're not already! One improvement should be done during the breakfast was to keep coffee and hot water hot! It was never hot during our entire stay. It was always luke warm. Us American likes hot coffee! Smile :) Our room was so charming, smaller than most American standard, but clean, fresh and comfortable. After a day or two of adjustments with its cute size, we were quite content. We both fell in love with the hotel, the housekeeping and breakfast staff, and the entire hotel as well. One improvement was needed at the front desk among the staff to communicate with each other. We had made a request for a wake-up call one morning at 6:00am but was not woken-up until 6:25am; the second request was for the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 8:00am but our reservation was not found at 8:00am but rather at 8:30am. We had to convinced the desk staff on duty that morning that we did indeed made our reservation at 8:00am and not 8:30am because of our 10:30am flight out of Rome. It took some talking but he finally gave in and had a driver took us to the airport; otherwise, the entire stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The location of the hotel was very convenient to the Vatican City, St. Peter Basilica, Castle de Saint Angelo, tons of shops and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Rome and will recommend this hotel to anyone who's going to Rome. Keep up the fabulous job!

Prior to my arrival the hotel was 45mins late at picking me up at the airport via their free shuttle. The rooms are extremely small with less than acceptable bathrooms. At the time I was there all the hallways were dirty with towels on the floor yet no one told me that they were going through some major renovation. The beatiful terrace that is on their website was closed yet it did not say that anywhere on their website. Their restaurant is only open at night time and in the morning the staff were extremely rude and provided no customer service or assistance. I was pouring at coffee at exactly 10am (when the breakfast ends) and the server literally took the carafe away from me and infomed that breakfast was done. I decided to change the rooms and they ofered me 3 to look at but all were terrible, dark, and small. I was so disappointed so after a night of hearing everyone in the hallways and doors slamming, I decided to take my things and move to a 2* hotel across the street for 100 euros which was the exact same quality. Moreover, the location of the hotel is great if you are walking but all surrounding streets are dirty and there are not many restaurants or cafes around. Actually there are garbage bins right in front of the hotel where you can see and hear locals dropping of their garbage. I would recommend staying across the water closer to the spanish steps and just walking from there. The hotel Griffe where I stayed last time was definetely a more luxurious choice eventhough it was in a more modern style. Also the hotel Locarno near Piazza Poppollo is a great location.

I tried to open up the one window which was very thick and was covered by a wood door. This is because right outside the window were the pipes to various sytems to the hotel and it was very loud. There was no view to speak of-just dirty roof tops and people's laundry hanging out to dry. I was also told that using a travel iron in the room was \"illegal\" which only prompts you to use their very expensive laundry service of which you have to keep calling to get delivered back to your room. The bathtub was so small and narrow that it is almost impossible to take a bath. The sink basin was cracked. The shower curtain was so short that the bathroom flooded after taking a shower. The roof top garden was under construction which is a draw to the hotel. The staff is not very helpful or accomodating.

Breakfast was not always ready by 7:00am, and we did find that more like 9:00 am. their full assortment of eggs would be served. Be sure to ask for a packed breakfast if you are touring and leaving before they open at 7:00 am. The hotel did provide when asked.

He told me, repair man did not stay at your hotel and to wait until tomorrow morning. I could not wait until tomorrow morning, because my wife could not take a bath that night. I strongly asked senior staff who told me he is a manager in your hotel to come to my room and watch the bath-tub. He came with me and he realized what the pjroblem was, then he went to upstair to get vacum rubber from restaurant and by using rubber, he picked up a bolt in the bath-tub, as a result the water in the bath-tub was discharged.

I had so many visions of luxury in my head from the website . I had read some bad and lukewarm reviews on this site, but there were also some good ones so i decided to keep an open mind. The rooms are dark and cramped. I thought our room would be bigger because of the description on the website. My two sons slept on nothing more then elongated chairs. They were hard and uncomfortable. The master bed was hard and uncomfortable as well. What was that crack in the middle of the bed? We pulled the sheet back to realize to our horror tnat these were two twin beds pushed together!!! We were not given enough bedding. On to the shower. We actually flooded the bathroom once because the plunger in the shower was broken. Maintenance came in twice and the problem was somewhat fixed. We were disappointed that the rooftop restaurant was not open. They really should take that off their site . That was the reason we booked this hotel and paid over 300 dollars a night. The continental breakfast was nice..and the view amazing from Les Etoiles restaurant. The location is wonderful. Within walking distance to everywhere. The staff is somewhat helpful and pleasant for italians. The maids were excellent. If you have never been to Rome ..it's a culture shock..or at least is was for us. My family has lived in Japan, and all over the U.S. I have also lived in Germany . I speak italian very well..studying for many years...but found that italians were very rude. No one smiles...you will get knocked over in a crowd if you don't move to the side. I was really dissapointed in the overall attitude of the italians. Like I said, I have lived in other countries so I am not naive to other cultures. I just thought I would add this. ALSO...STAY OUT OF PIAZZA NAVONA..if you want a decent meal. They will pull you in and sit you at their outside cafe's and you will have the worst italian food you have ever tasted for a couple hundred dollars. I recommend taking a Frommer's book and looking up the restaurants in the \"Where to Dine\" section. That really helped us to find great restaurants. Also ...the Rome day by day is a great book and our holy grail when we were in Rome. I hope this helped. I wish I would've read a review like this before my trip..so I hope this will help someone else. Oh...and don't stay at the Atlante Star. For the price there are much nicer hotels .

One in particular, named Joseph, chit chatted with us while we looked over the wine menu and when he found out that we were on our honeymoon, he brought us that complimentary champagne, as well as some appetizers from a party that was going on. Housekeeping seemed to be a sporadic occurence that varied in quality. The breakfast was continental and fair, but certainly nothing special. If you are in a hurry, go for it, but if not, don't worry. In Italy, you have so many options that I would suggest that you not waste your time and money on cheerios and lipton tea.

Although reviews were varied, the descriptions and photos implied a well appointed hotel with 4 star accommodations, rooftop garden dining, and prime location for touring the Vatican. Other than its proximity to the Vatican, this hotel was a disgusting disappointment in every other way. I pre-booked two suites in this hotel through Priceline, weeks before departing on my trip. After three attempts, I was finally able to reconfirm my specific suite reservations directly with the hotel prior to leaving the US. Both suites were confirmed to include king beds, showers, jacuzzi tubs, and Vatican views. Upon arrival, the lobby area of the hotel seemed pleasant. Only one suite (309/10) was ready and we chose to store our luggage there until the second suite was ready. Exiting the elevator on our appointed floor and upon entering the first suite, we were visually assaulted by a decor which personified tacky 1970's Las Vegas. There was nothing of the decor or room that related to the photogrtaphs provided by, or about this hotel on any web site. The suite was dark, dingy, tiny and cheap; no where near a 4-star rating or the 4-star price they charged. When returning to the hotel after sightseeing, I was given a key to the second \"suite\" (407); only to find it was not at all what was not reserved or confirmed. It was an L-shaped queen room with a extra twin bed where a sofa would have been. A trip back down to the front desk to request a change proved useless. The desk clerk informed me that this was the only room they had. When reminded that I possessed a fax confirmation from the hotel for two identical king suites, he told me that there were not two suites which were the same, that it would be impossible for me to have an identical suite, and that he had no other room to give me. Realizing I was extremely dissatisfied, he reduced the price of the second room by 100 euros. Between the two rooms, we experienced: stiffling heat, which could only be alleviated by opening windows and shutters (making any attempts at sleep impossible due to all-night traffic and pedestrian noise); visible mold all over the marble shower; a toilet that would not flush - seemingly without running water to it; a tub drain that belched and gurgled all night long; a room door handle that was literally falling off (on the inside); one room phone that did not work, which required the bellman to come knocking on the door in the morning for the wake-up call; a room wake up call that was almost an hour late; mattresses that were totally shot; housekeping that was haphazard; lights burned out; and complimntary champagne in ice buckets without ice - just two inches of tepid water. The rooftop garden where breakfast was to be served was not open - without explanation; and breakfast was served on another floor. Breakfast was not set up at the appointed opening time and the full offering was only available some 45 minutes later, when guests who needed to depart the hotel for the airport would have already left; perhaps a good strategy for controlling food costs. The hotel does offer \"free\" shuttle service from the airport, but seems to have trouble coordinating the pick-up; ours did not happen. Curiously though, the return trip is always on time, but is only provided for a charge.

They spoke to the hotel who would do nothing for them and didn't care (presumably as long as they got their money. It seems that they over book the Atlante Star and use thier sister hotel, the Atlante Garden (a 2*/3*)as an overflow - rather like other sewers!! We took a refund from the tour operator, who were also ignored, and walked around Rome in the rain looking for a new hotel rather than stay. The room was appalling, the staff lied and seemed to see us as a cash making machine and the smug attitude made me so angry.... Hotels like this give the city a bad name and having booked this hotel as a get away after my partners treatment for cancer and having seen our dream holiday nearly ruined I will only say that no one should book this hotel. I am getting in touch with all the tour operators and hotel bodies to complain and would say to anyone thinking of booking here to look elsewhere.", "Date": "October 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Augustine, FL", "Title": "\u201cWow !!

I especially booked this hotel with the rooftop bar in mind only to find out that it was under renovation when we got there. Very disappointing since we had no view what so ever from out little room. And as another person said in his review the bar in the lobby is small and lacks atmosphere. I'm used to small european rooms but this was a \"cracker box\" room they put us in. They are tastefully decorated and clean. But don't be looking for anything extra with these rooms because you will surely not find them here. We had problems finding a place to put our suitcases down and not having to step over them to move around in the room. We found no english speaking tv stations the second time we stayed there (later in our trip and on the way home). We were told it was a satellite problem. Not even CNN. It made for a long night since the rooftop bar was closed as was the lobby bar closed due to the employee being in an accident. So relaxing at the hotel wasn't an option that evening. Breakfast is what you normally expect for european standards (rolls, meats, danish, horrible juice, horrible coffee (mud), etc) and wasn't altogether terrible but nothing outstanding. They must bring the hot breakfast out later in the morning as we caught it once in our stay since we were leaving later that day. I will give then credit for the view during breakfast which is in the hotel restaurant. Wonderful view of the vatican. We did not eat in the restaurant for dinner which looked a little pricey.

Firstly, there is NO rooftop restaurant, hasn't been for some months, and won't be for the rest of the season due to maintainance work. This means that there is no bar to relax in (except in the lobby which is very small and dark and lacks atmosphere) and nowhere reasonable to eat in the hotel ( the 6th floor restuarant is very expensive -\u00a355 euros each for the set menu). There is also no Sky tv as advertised, no tea making facilities in the room and no information booklet about the hotel. The front panels are missing from the tv's which are still operational from the remote controls but makes the tv's look scruffy. We had room 508 which was incredibly small making it difficult to walk around the bed. The decor was very tastefully done, especially in the bathroom but one of the controls was broken on the jacuzzi. We informed the staff on our arrival that we were on our honeymoon but they were completely disinterested and forgot to provide us with champagne in our room as per our booking. We seem to have got off fairly lightly though. Many guests were complaining in reception. One couple had not been allocated a room for 2 days despite booking 3 months in advance so they had to find a B&B till their room was ready. They were blaitantly lied to and the staff were inconsistant about the reasons for the delay. Staff tried to move them into the basement but they quite rightly refused. Breakfast was nice. A good variety and a great view of St Peters. The view from our room looked out onto a back street although we weren't promised any particular view when we booked.

The hotel is in a great location, near major sights and buslines, from which it is easy to see all of Rome. We shared a \"Quad room\" equipped with hairdryer, soaking tub/shower, bidet, two separate sleeping rooms, stocked fridge, flat screen TV (who would bother with infinitely wonderful Rome at your fingertips?), air conditioning. The rooms are smaller than American hotels typically provide. The queen bed was comfortable but the two singles were more like cots...though we slept like logs after walking all day long. Shutters assure quiet even though our room overlooked a busy street. Housekeeping is very good. The lobby sitting room contains a computer with Internet access for a reasonable price-per-minute, or, for the same price, you can hook up in your room. Italian newspapers are available gratis every day, and the Herald Tribune if you are an early bird. The staff are courteous, especially if you ask for concierge assistance getting tickets, for example, and for ideas for activities and transportation routes/modes. We learned from the staff about an inexpensive bossa nova concert at a modern outdoor auditorium one night, a contemporary respite from historical Rome. We also asked for a picnic breakfast to take to the airport when we left for an early flight home, which the hotel then provided as part of the service. Most importantly, we asked for a room change for more comfort after we checked in, and were accomodated the next day even tho the hotel was sold out. But be sure to ask for what you want or need. Most of the staff speak English, some are multi-lingual. Breakfasts are generous--a buffet of tasty selections but other than hot hard boiled eggs, hot meal choices are not offered every morning. The breakfast room is situated on the top floor and offers one of the best views of the city, an inspiring way to start the day. It becomes an elegant and pricey dinner venue in the evening. Above is an open-air rooftop patio that catches the morning and evening breezes--a delightful spot day or night, with relaxed evening bar service. Within a radius of 3-4 blocks there are many trattorias offering reasonably-priced meals and cafe refreshments. Also nearby is a large mercado where one can buy fresh fruits, vegies, flowers etc. and a major shopping boulevard with boutiques and department stores. (Not that I'm into shopping.) Walking the back ways to St. Peter's and Castel Sant' Angelo (just a few blocks either way) is more charming than the main boulevards because of the little shops and gelatorias along the way. One still must dodge the occasional scooter or Mercedes even on the most obscure cobblestone alley, however.

I had arranged months in advance for a romantic touch for our trip as it was our one year wedding anniversary. We were promised a room upgrade and a sparkling bottle of wine. We did get both of these but the wine was red and i had to ask the desk if we had been given an upgrade as it didn\u2019t have the deluxe feel i expected. Anyway i was assured that all room on the fifth floor are the deluxe rooms so i decided to forget about it and get on with the holiday. The room was tiny and only enough room to walk down the side of the bed and around the desk. A little more room would have made the room a little more 'Deluxe!!!\u2019 The bathroom was quite large and tiled in marble. The Jacuzzi looked ok but we never used it as it looked old and as if it needed replacing. The shower pressure was poor and the fittings were falling off the wall or had actually been removed and not replaced? The sink was great and there were plenty of towels made available. All in all the room was comfortable apart from the 6ft square mirror behind the bed, which if you are not the most confident person regarding your body then it will definitely set you off in a good mood in the morning. On the other hand you can imagine you are on the set of some 70's blue movie and have the time of your life!!!!!!! a nice picture would of done!! The location of the hotel is good for the Vatican museums and St Peters. If you like walking the rest is easily reachable and bus routes pass the hotel frequently. On the first day we walked to the Roman Forum which wasn\u2019t too far, but Bus 190 back was a good idea after a full days walking!! I recommend eating in Trastevere at night. The restaurant next in Santa Maria next to the bar with the oranges is fantastic! Explanation seems strange but you will see what i mean when you go. Travellers were easily changed at the front desk as long as they have enough EUROS to do it. A few times they could only change 100 at a time. The restaurant seemed to be busy every night and the smells coming down the stairs towards our room were always tempting early in the evening. Breakfast gives you an insight to what it would belike to eat dinner up there. To be honest I don't think I would rate it that highly. If you don't get a table near the side window then the view of St Peters is non existent. I would recommend to the hotel that they allow people to eat breakfast or serve special meals on the roof garden terrace as this is where the view is especially spectacular. After breakfast, walks up the stairs next to the lift and take in the view\u2026it is amazing and the selling point of the hotel and restaurant. Anyway to sum up the hotel needs a facelift and the bathrooms need replacing. They need to provide a personal safe in the room and restock the mini bar when something is used. Warnings as well, make sure you have a travel iron as they do not provide irons due to insurance. The beds are comfortable and the room elegantly decorated. The air conditioning is really good and the lighting options in the room convenient. I just felt like it didn't have the special sparkle you would expect from a 4 star superior, maybe 3 star to be honest. Anyway for a comfortable stay with great views and convenient location for the Vatican then stay here but if you hunt I am sure you can find a better place to stay.
