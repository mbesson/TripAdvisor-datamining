Immediately after we arrived, my wife and I walked down the street and within minutes we found ourselves the the Luxembourg Garden, which is amazing to walk around, and is a great way of locating our hotel when walking back from other sites. Another great feature about the hotel was the staff, they were very nice, helpful, and even humored my attempts at french based on my grade 9 knowledge. They constantly offered to help if we were in the lobby looking at maps trying to figure out where we were going, and they all had a very upbeat and friendly attitude. As for cleanliness, the room was always clean when we came back from a day of walking around the city, and when it was hot the maid would put on the air conditioner for us so that we could cool down when we got back.

Not all of these turned out to be true. I piled my partner into the lift with most of the baggage and set of up the stairs with the rest, I was not going to fit! We arrived in the room, the decor was very nice. Getting through the door was a bit of a trial, you had to get in shut the door and then move past the door with a suitcase and then repeat the whole process again with the other suitcases. We eventually managed to get us and our suitcases into the room; we sat on the bed surveying the scene. We were trying to work out where we were going to put things so we could get in and out of the door. We eventually managed this by pilling all three of our suitcases on top of each other in one corner. We still had the problem of moving around the room though, we eventually decided on the system of only one of us was allow to move at a time with the other sitting on the bed till the other had finished moving. There was a bedside table on my partners side but my side of the bed was only 20cm from the curtains, so not much room for getting in and out of bed, good job I\u2019m on the skinny side and certainly no room for a bedside table so nowhere to put my water or glasses, which made getting out of bed all the more precarious. The bed incidentally was comfy and quite firm but I like it like that. The room had no drinks making facilities but I was expecting that. The air-con and safe were easy to operate, there was a TV but we didn\u2019t turn it on. There was no ironing board and no room for one anyway. The bathroom did have a shower over the bath which was a plus but the head could have done with the lime scale removing so it didn\u2019t shoot water in your eyes. It had one of those big soap/shampoo dispensers but I didn\u2019t use it. The hairdryer was one of those ones that looks like a Hoover, which just tend to dry your hair rather than style, fine for blokes with long hair? Maybe? The bathroom also lacked curtains, it did have frosted glass but I found the lack of curtains disturbing especially when it was dark outside. We soon worked out that the soundproofing between the rooms was none existent, we could hear conversation in other rooms, and at one point could hear people weeing! Breakfast, if you want a croissant and why wouldn\u2019t you your in France then it\u2019s ok but rather pricey, the rest of breakfast was all prepacked in cellophane wrappers, or on the plastic side (Ham) or rubbery side (scrambled egg \u2013 no condiments) would defiantly recommend you went out for breakfast. Which brings us onto location, which is fantastic, ideally suited for cafes and restaurants and a Metro just over the road. Quiet at night as well, outside the hotel that is. The staff at this hotel are extremely friendly and helpful, the saving grace for this hotel. On the day of leaving, we had to get up early to catch a train, too early for breakfast, we went to get coffee from machine in the lobby but were told we were not allowed to have a drink before 7 as there were guest rooms on the ground floor and the machine made to much noise, we did eventually did get a coffee at 6:45. The hotel was renovated in 2008, it has been done very nicely but they seem to have crammed too many rooms into the hotel, which is a shame as the location is perfect.

I chose the hotel because of its prime location, and because of the many good reviews posted on this site by other TripAdvisor members.

My only gripe would be that the bath was rather small - even standing up in it to shower proved difficult for me (but then I am a tall man). The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and spoke English very well indeed. The breakfast in the morning was pretty good too - scrambled eggs, breads, croissants, cold ham, cheese, cereals, coffee, tea, juice, milk, fruit. Regarding the hotel's location - it was ideal. Situated in a small but lively street just off the Boulevard de Montparnasse, there was a plethora of cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. If you are on a tight budget, you might find the prices in many of the local eating establishments a little prohibitive, so I would suggest you make your way to the Latin Quarter (metro line 4:St-Michel, 6 stops up from the local station), where you will find a large number of much cheaper restaurants. Remember that, for the most part, you get what you pay for. We found that the 3 dinners we had in the Latin Quarter were good value for money (45 euros for 3 courses, including wine and coffee). The 3 dinners we had in Montparnasse cost more, but were of a correspondingly better standard.

The breakfast is a buffet-style - scrambled eggs, fresh bread, flaky and freshly-baked croissants, muffins, scones, other types of bread, orange juice, coffee, tea assortment packets, butter, different kinds og jellies, ham, hot chocolate french packets, nutella spread packets, etc... let me tell you about our room- my daughter and i loved it so much! 2 twin beds with nice soft pillows , the room design is really my type of room in mind even before we entered the bedroom. the bathroom is quite big and a nice all-white color with a huge rectangular mirror, i love how they put a very stylish heater in this bathroom. aha! the other nice thing - a plus really, is that in this bathroom there is also a huge window ,but styled like a french balcony, oh my it is really very nice. in the bedroom, there is also a very huge window with a lace curtain. just looking out our window hotel is very pleasing- there's a bank, a pub called shannon pub, a butcher shop (la boucherie), a book shop, a few blocks down there is a pastry shop, pizza restaurant, crepes stands, oh, so many!). plain crepe with sugar and a little butter is about 1.50 euros. if you order a crepe in a restaurant it is about 7 euros. just get a crepe from the stands, it tastes the same. the lobby of. the hotel is also very elegant, with nice sofas, a fireplace, newspapers, tourist guide booklets. adjacent to the front desk there is another living room area which is also huge and provide a comfy ambiance. then to the corner there is a little flower garden ( we forgot to visit this garden!). there is also a stylish computer on the corner of the living room. i had to use the computer for like 30 minutes, and the guy at the front desk let me use it without a fee. very nice of him! before i forget, 2 days before our flight to new york, the guy at the desk was able to book a taxi for us to go to the charles de gaulle airport. the taxi driver was prompt. he is very nice and friendly and he comes inside the lobby to get us and assisted us in our luggage. his taxi is also elegant and a spacious one. on the way to the airport we were able to see other famous parisian sites like the moulin rouge, galleries lafayette, etc... too many to mention. the taxi driver was very helpful and very pleasant. on the way to the airport he picked like 6 more passengers from different hotels (this hotels are also nice looking!), coz these passengers are also going to the charlesde gaulle airport like us. the other passengers were also smiling and just friendly. i just love paris so much and the people. another plus, is that hotel le brea is surrounded by lots of restaurants like le dome, la rotonde cafe, etc. it is also very near the vavin metro train station. we just walked a few steps from our hotel to go to this metro station. then after vavin we got off at the gare station. we also walked from this hotel going to the world -famous luxembourg gardens. also from this hotel once you get out the main hotel door, just turn left, walk straight on the road and it will lead you to the river seine. the louvre is just beside the seine river! (tip: the entrance to the louvre museum itself is the triangle glass dome. even if you see a huge crowd waiting to enter the louvre, don't be intimidated,. everyone gets in fast). hotel jardin le brea is really an ideal hotel to stay in paris, france. near le dome cafe, there is a wide street which is really breath-taking- venture here and you can see lots of stores, restaurants, cafes, crepe stands. we walked here in the evening and its really nice. the capuccino at la rotonde is to die for, as well as the pasta , breads, chocolate crepe and the salmon that i had. from this hotel it is easy to go to the trocadero metro station (where the eiffel tower is), but as i mentioned before you have to go first to the vavin metro station. i'm also happy to mention here that we also went to the champs ellysees- and guess what, we went to see the world-famous out -of-this-world, LIDO show, please, please, even if this show is very expensive, you have to watch this show. i paid 140 euros or 150 euros each person to watch this show-this is the price that includes dinner. before the show and the dinner, beware they will take your picture and later they will sell this for $20.00 each. i was so excited for the show to start and i bought 2 pictures-one for my picture and 1 picture of my daughter. on the show brochure they have included the menu for this dinner. they serve dinner first, then the show. i'm tired of typing now, so have a happy and safe trip to those who plan on traveling to paris!!!", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201ccozy little hotel in lovely, quiet corner of the 6th\u201d", "Author": "martinamis", "ReviewID": "UR57599011", "Content": "clean, quiet, friendly, great location, got a room facing into the courtyard (no view but very peaceful...room is tres european (tiny) but cozy and fine for two....courteous front desk personnel, great restaurants nearby, good firm mattress...what more could you want?", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evansville, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cPleasant Surprise\u201d", "Author": "Kathy47714", "ReviewID": "UR55999860", "Content": "I was stranded in Paris when a friend of a friend at the last minute failed to lend their apartment over the holidays.

Ok first things first....mmm location: Location:..in close proximity to the ever popular and beautiful Luxembourg gardens and situated in the 6th arrondiesment, you really cant go wrong with the location of this hotel..only a minute walk from the VAVIN metro stop which connects you to the whole of paris in the matter of minutes, the hotel is located in a small yet lively rue de brea street which is filled with small shops (mainly for locals), cafes, restaurants, shops etc etc it is quiet and yet you still get a nice feel of human interaction. If your travelling from the airport, catch the RER B to DENFERT ROCHERAU station then from that station get the METRO line 4 to VAVIN and its a minute walk from the station. 5**** HOTEL ROOM: Yes yes the rooms are small..but lets face it if your not a super large frame then you will have no problems with mobility in your room, apparently this is the norm in paris and if me and my lady stayed in the standard double room which was comfortable had a great view of the rue de brea street and the bed...well lets just say that we had a nice lie in every morning. The rooms are well equipped with your everyday amenities such as towels, hairdryer, toiletries, TV and the best aspect a SAFE to protect all your important documents & passports but disappointly no iron or kettle but thats just me being picky. The rooms are serviced & cleaned everyday..a lil tiny bit worn in some small edges but thats to be expected. 5***** HOTEL: The service of our concierge 'GAELLE' was amazing, she is the loveliest woman you will meet in Paris and she helps out a great deal, speaks amazingly fluent english and is always on hand. Not to miss out but the rest of the staff were top notch too. The hotel is a 3 stars but I never rate hotels on their stars more their reviews and reputation, this is a lovely little hotel that is close to the city but in a non toursity area. In my stay I was included breakfast and if any of you are questioning whether or not to include breakfast in your stay then I highly recommend it..here is a list of what they have to offer for petit dejeuner, scrambed eggs, toast, fresh orange, tea, coffee, pan au chocolat, croissants (2 other buns which were delicious), cereal, baguettes, ham, fruit salad and many more. Ok so thats about it..ooh wait I forgot the best part for 4 nights stay in August over the weekend it cost me and my lady a grand total of 360 euros which is fantastic..around 300 pounds. book with HRS.COM they do the best deals..trust me I did a week of hardcore searching. Enjoy and bon voyage! Samuel p.s: hit the latin quarter for food..try ALEXANDRA and the stone cooked meat, its fun, enjoyable and delicious for only 15 euro per head. get the metro stop to PLACE MONGE for the latin quarter, there is streets of little restaurants inexpensive and great food.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wash DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and good value for money\u201d", "Author": "Rochl", "ReviewID": "UR36994363", "Content": "This is a hotel near the Montparnasse train station.

Rue de Brae is a narrow little street that has a number of OK little food places and small shops.

The Luxembourg Gardens are an easy walk and a great place to simply hang out with the Parisians doing what they do. Latin Quarter is a nice 20 minute walk away.

There are three different Metro subway stops within a few blocks, so it's easy to get to and from anywhere in Paris. It's not a chain or business-traveler hotel at all. Very cute, quaint, friendly and comfortable. Super friendly staff, free internet access in the lobby, incredible free breakfasts in the downstairs cafe. The room we stayed was on the third floor. There is an elevator, but you can't fit more than two people with no luggage inside. The room was small compared to your typical hotel room, but had every amenity we could need.

The hotel was perfect for us -- intimate and very \"French,\" but the reception staff spoke perfect English. I started out trying to speak in French but realized there was no point -- their English was infinitely superior to my French. The staff were very helpful with dinner reservations and also booked us a shuttle back to the airport at the end of our trip. The rooms are small (of course) but spotless and very comfortable. Our room seemed to be recently renovated. We were on the second floor and didn't face the street (which I was glad about, since the Irish bar across the street was a bit noisy on weekend evenings), but had a nice view of the little courtyard behind the hotel. Note that there is an elevator but it's VERY tiny -- I wouldn't recommend the hotel if you can't climb stairs. Breakfast was included in the price of our package. It was very simple but the croissants were good. We ate there every day except the last day, when we felt a little tired of the \"cave-like\" feeling of the breakfast room and decided to eat out. I wouldn't eat there unless breakfast is included with your rate, as there are too many great eating options in Paris to waste your money in a hotel basement! It was fine for us though. There was a computer with free internet access in the lobby, which came in very handy for me. We loved the location of the hotel. There are lots of shops, bakeries, restaurants, etc., very nearby. We bought wine at the wine shop across the street and delicious pastries at the nearby patisserie on Rue Vavin. There is a very interesting African restaurant right around the corner.

Yes the rooms are smaller compared to North American standards but they are perfectly adequate (Trust me that you are not going to be spending much time there). The bathroom was an OK size. You could actually have a soak in the tub. The bed may not look comfortable but looks are deceiving. We have had worse beds in 5 star hotels in N/A. Not much seating in the room but if you wanted to sit and read a book there is a large well appointed sitting area looking out onto the street. As stated in other reviews the air conditioning is really that quite. The windows are very sound proof. The staff is very polite and helpful. The breakfast was good but given the number of restaurants close by not worth the 12e. It was included in our package and we enjoyed it every day. The room was very clean with fresh linen every day. The location is great. There are two metro stops close by and from there you can get just about anywhere. We found that no matter where we were we could either catch a metro or bus that would pretty much get us back to the hotel (excellent metro system and easy to use). The restaurants in the area are excellent and there are plenty to choose from. (I recommend Chez Clement). There is everything from an Irish pub to Thai. The hotel is close to shopping on St. Germain and Luxemburg gardens (probably one of the best in the city). Couple of other things to note for North Americans. The hair dryer in our room had a 115v plug for a shaver (wish I would have known this a head of time). I can\u2019t say of other rooms but one would hope they used the same hair dryer everywhere. The front desk holds the room key while you are out. No need to worry about loosing it. There is someone at the front desk 24/7. Paris itself was amazing. Who says the French are rude? We found that as long as you make attempts to understand the language and culture they are very polite and helpful. We had people come up to us on the street and help us when we were trying to figure out the metro. In one week we ran into one rude person. I would say that average is less than N/A.

The seats on the plane are close, so if upgrading to \"Club Class\" is an option for you, go for it. LOCATION: This hotel is 5 stars simply for the location. It is in Montparnasse (14th district) and is SURROUNDED by reasonably priced restaurants, pastry shops, and cool cafes where you can sit and have a drink. It is a stone's throw from the Metro Vavin, which will take you to any of the major sites in Paris in 15 minutes or less. Don't bother using taxis, they are slow and expensive. For $1.50 euros you can get anywhere in Paris quickly on the Metro!! ROOM: The room is relatively small, but not as small as others in Paris. Our room overlooked the street, with windows that opened up completely so you could enjoy Rue Le Brea and all of the cool little shops. Rue Le Brea is a quaint side street, so it is away from the other busy main streets of Montparnasse. The windows are sound proof if you choose to close them at night, so no need to stay at the back of the hotel which gives you a view of another building. The bathroom is fine, the only downside was that the tub had a hand held shower which is mounted only a couple feet up the wall, so you would have to hold it to wash your hair and body. The hotel does have other rooms of the \"superior\" class where there are stand up showers, so you could request these rooms for a slightly higher fee. The AC is the quietest (literally) that I have ever experienced in a hotel. It has a remote and keeps things at an even temperature so you are not always adjusting it. Not like a typical noisy and freezing AC unit in a North American hotel. The tv gets 3 English channels for background noise when you're getting ready--- but who comes to Paris for TV? BREAKFAST The breakfast was very good, a variety of pastries, cereal, fresh fruit salad, baguettes, cheeses and meat, and freshly squeezed juice and coffee. A nice start to the day. Staff is friendly and will help you with any questions. OVERALL I HIGHLY recommend this hotel....clean, tasty breakfast, and the BEST location!!

The hotel is on a very cute street (Rue Le Brea) and is a minute walk from the Vavin metro stop (metro #4), and a bustling area with wonderful cafes and shops. The hotel seems tiny. The passages and staircases are narrow, and the elevator can hardly fit a person with a suitcase! We had a room on the first floor with a big window which overlooked Rue Le Brea. It was wonderful to watch the world go by, and it was, surprisingly, not too noisy. The room was small but comfortable. The bathroom did not have a bathtub, only a shower, and was fairly cramped. However, we believe this is fairly standard for Paris. The hotel offered breakfast, but, unlike the hotels we stayed in in Italy, breakfast was not included in the price. We definitely recommend skipping the 12 Euro hotel buffet, and rather pick up coffee and a croissant from one of the many wonderful cafe's surrounding the hotel. The hotel staff were very friendly, knowledgeable about Paris and helpful. In fact, before they offered us our room, they warned us that it may be a little noisy as we checked in on a Saturday and there is an Irish Pub on the street near the hotel. However, as stated above, the noise was not a problem. We appreciated their honesty and caution, though. While we would stay here again, I fell in love with an area of Paris around Rue de Buci (near the Odeon and St. Germain des-Pres metro stops) in the heart of the Left Bank a little closer to the Seine River (although also in the 6th Adroissment).

Two friends also stayed in another room and only had good things to say about their room and the hotel as well. The staff suffered through my pigeon French and spoke English competently and without any hint of pretentiousness that we occasionally found elsewhere in the city. Possible negatives that one should be aware of: (1) I guess like pretty much all Parisian hotels, the rooms are somewhat smallish. Having consulted other Parisian hotels on Trip Advisor, we expected a small room. We found the rooms sufficiently large to function in however and by no means were we bumping into each other. (2) Our bath did not have a shower curtain. There was a shower nozzle to wash oneself with, but one had to quickly develop the skill of washing oneself without spraying the floor outside the tub. The tub itself is narrow, so adding a curtain would likely make things just as awkward. It was at the end of our European journey and we had encountered many other worse inconviences than this, but if this was our first stop, I might not have so foregiving about this point. (3) The breakfast was included in our hotel price. Otherwise, my understanding is that the hotel breakfast costs 14 Euro. (It may be slightly cheaper, but the same message applies). This price isn't unusual for Parisian hotels, but there are some nice patisseries up the street that serve most of what's served at breakfast. We loved our morning breakfast downstairs, but unless one absolutely needs Corn Flakes to start their day, I'd recommend coffee and a croissant somewhere else at half the price. (4) Our hotel room faced the street. There is a pub across the street so there was the usual noise of people going to/coming from at closing hours on weekends. One Saturday morning, we could hear the street cleaners or garbage collectors pass by at some entirely too reasonable an hour to be out of bed (8 or 9 a.m.?). Otherwise, the hotel is on a street that is deathly quiet, 50 yards or so from a main intersection where the bustle doesn't seem to stop. For us, the occasional noise was a little thing that we didn't mind given everything else the hotel has to offer. (5) A hairdryer is provided in each room, but my wife informs me that someone with shoulder length hair would spend half a day drying their hair with it, so bring a hairdryer of your own (if you aren't a balding relic like me). Those are my nits to pick. Otherwise, the hotel was beautifully decorated, impeccably clean, fabulously located with an exceptionally helpful and pleasant staff.

I have found Montparnasse to be one of the loveliest areas of Paris; with its ornate buildings, fine selection of restaurants, greengrocers and patisseries and curios shops all dotted along its tree-lined streets. Therefore, I consider Montparnasse not only one of the more attractive areas of Paris, but also one of the more relaxing dining experiences. You can imagine my relief when we arrived at the doors to the hotel to find it completely charming and obviously newly refurbished. We were checked in quickly while our bags were taken up to our room. The hotel is situated down a side road off the main Montparnasse road, meaning that you are very close to everything you might need (restaurants/shops etc), but also far enough away from the busy road that you cannot hear the traffic at night, not even with the window open. I\u2019ll break down my views on the rest of the amenities for ease of reading: Reception and Lounge Areas. The reception and lounge areas were lovely, bright and clean, and the staff extremely friendly and helpful. There was a choice of two lounge areas, one featuring large soft sofas, and the others a more formal cushioned wicker set. Dining Area. The restaurant was located in the cellar, but it was a decent size, beautifully decorated and light, I thoroughly enjoyed my breakfasts down there\u2026and the buffet provided was always well stocked and varied. Rooms. Our room was clean, airy and light. Despite being relatively small, which most hotel rooms in Paris are due to the laws governing period buildings and alterations there-in, it furnished all necessary needs (except for the British requirement of a kettle\u2026but we being British had of course taken an emergency travel kettle! Ha ha ha!). Oh, and there was a decently sized flat-screen TV mounted unobtrusively on the wall for those who cannot go more than a day without feeding the habit, but when turned off you didn\u2019t even notice it was there (for those avoiding reality whilst on holiday, like me!). Bathrooms and Toilets. I found our personal bathroom and toilet (separate) to be clean and modern, and the room was changed every day. I feel I have to mention the shower here (because it is a pet thing of mine), it was a good shower, not one of those terrible ones that dribbles on you and leaves you struggling to get the shampoo out of your hair. The remainder of our stay at Hotel Jardin La Brea continued to be as enjoyable and effortless as our arrival.

I was assigned a small but functional room overlooking rue Le Brea. The room was spotlessly clean and simply yet tastefully furnished. The washroom was equally clean and quite large, in contrast to the compact nature of the room. As an avid walker who enjoys exploring the city on foot, I found the hotel conveniently located to access most of the major tourist destinations yet far enough away from the tourist hordes to get a true glimpse of Parisian living. That being said, it is a brisk 25-30 minute stroll to sights such as the Louvre, Effiel Tower and points north of the Seine. For those with less athletic inclination, the hotel is conveniently located within minutes of a couple of metro stations which will take you anywhere in the city. A metro ride to the Champs Elysee for an Sunday evening supper with business colleagues took me less than 10 minutes although the metro appeared remarkably busy even at that hour. There are numerous excellent restaurants, boulangaries and patisseries situated around the intersection of boul Montparnasse/Raspaille and boul Raspaille and rue Vavin. A small but well-supplied grocer can also be found a couple of hundred feet down a quiet side street just south-west of the intersection of Montparnasse and Raspaille which is wonderful for picking up snacks for the hotel room. My positive impressions of the hotel only improved after meeting with my work colleagues at the hotel they were staying at just south of Cimetiere Montparnasse.

If we were interested in doing more things in Montparnasse, the location would have been great, but since we found ourselves dining and exploring the St. Germain des Pres/Latin Quarter area so much more, the hotel was just a few blocks south of where we would have preferred to be.The metro makes it quick to reach many things, but being within immediate walking distance to more of the museums, restaurants, and attractions that we were interested in would also have been nice.", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Jardin le Brea", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d194283-Reviews-Hotel_Jardin_le_Brea-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$167 - $300*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">14 rue Brea</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">6th Arr.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75006</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "194283", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cd/92/f1/jardin-d-hiver-winter.jpg"}}
