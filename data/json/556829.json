We stayed at Yulia Beach Inn for almost three weeks (July 2007). The rooms were nice and reasonably-priced. The staff were understanding and extended favors to us since they saw that we were with children. There were mosquitoes in the rooms we stayed, though. (In three weeks, we transfered to three different rooms). My cousin, being so sensitive to mosquitoes, always reminded the front office to have our room sprayed. Though I believed there were no more mosquitoes in our rooms. Their pool for adult is small compared to some hotels there, and sometimes the cleaning gets delayed. Well, thanks to them anyhow; my 4 year old son learned to swim in their pool. The garden is well-maintained. The staff at the coffee shop took care of us every morning when we had breakfast and they were so warm...at least to me...The female staff at the front office are very helpful, too. The Matahari Department Store and grocery is just at the back of the hotel, around the corner. Lots of 24hours shops around (Circle K, Minimart etc)", "Date": "Aug 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR495840161", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "So_cool_mum"}, {"Content": "Fantastic Hotel Absolutely wonderful place to stay.
