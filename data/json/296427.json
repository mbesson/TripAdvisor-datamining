First of all, when we arrived the first night we were told \"there was a problem with the room\" and we had to be relocated to another hotel. The next morning I found out that they had overbooked the hotel and that was the reason for us having to move. I understand that hotels sometimes makes mistakes and has to relocate people, but our room was pre-paid and I had already informed the hotels 3 times in the last to weeks before our arrival that we would have a late arrival. They could have told us then that they we would have to stay at another hotel the first night instead of telling us at 2 am when we arrived dead-tired after a long day of traveling. The Aziyade hotel was actually paid double for our room that night... our pre-paid money and the other guests rate for that night. They offered us a buffet dinner to make up for it. This buffet was old, stale and almost empty and they did not make an effort to fill it up for us. We had to pay for the drinks, even for water even though the dinner was suppose to be on the house. The restaurant staff was unplesant when they found out that the meal was on the house. Management at this hotel is ONLY concerned with making money and this is the feel you get from all the staff aswell. We asked for recommendations for restaurants in Istanbul. I specifically asked for a nice place, not too \"touristy\". The reception staff gave med 4 brochures to 4 highly tourist-places - the reason? these places pay the Aziyade hotel to send customers. We tried one of those restaurants by accident for lunch one day and the food was ok'ish (i\u00c2\u00b4m being kind), way too expensive in regards to how much food we got and they gave us service charge upon service charge. (it was the Hamdi restaurant in Haminonu). The feel of the place was awful, just tourists and almost junk-food restaurant feel. Our stay in Istanbul was good, not because of the Aziyade hotel, but in spite of it. We used other hotels and other locals for advise on restaurants and cafes. The hotel was just somewhere we slept, the rooms were clean enough, but very small. The staff in the whole hotel was unplesant and rude at times and I would not recommend anyone to stay here. Don't jeopardize your stay by choosing this hotel. There are so many other hotels in Istanbul - it's not worth it to choose this one and taking the chance that the staff might try to ruin your stay too. We really aren't difficult guests, we just want honest advice and a hotel staff that smiles and offer genuine service. When they offer something complimentary it has to at least be acceptible in terms of standard, otherwise it would just feel like another kick in the back.", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cYour perfect choice\u201d", "Author": "First_Advice", "ReviewID": "UR127637756", "Content": "The hotel's servise was great The breakfast was A+.

The restaurantr/breakfast room is on the 7th floor with terrific views out over the sea of Marmara. The breakfast buffet takes up the whole length of the room with a vast selection on offer. It was impossible to sample everything in the six days there. Fresh fruit salad, juices including sour cherry, hot Turkish sausage with scrambled egg; cutting sections of real natural honeycomb to go with delicious yoghurt especially good, but there was so much more; cucumber, olives and novel cheeses an interesting variation. The same restaurant in the evening has a super buffet or a la carte at amazingly cheaper prices than surrounding cafes. Free wifi was good and worked in bedroom, lobby and restaurant. and there is a free computer and printer, so boarding passes can be easily printed. Bedrooms are on the small side but spotlessly clean, and beds were very comfortable. The basket of different local soaps in the bathroom was a nice touch, as was the nightly Turkish delight left on the bed each evening. Staff were friendly and very helpful.

We found the room to very good, not too small, ok view of the street out front but you cannot drink the water in the hotel, so we bought 2 6-packs of 1.5 L bottles for the stay from nearby stores. Prices vary but about 10 lira per 6pack seems right. Shower pressure was excellent as were the soaps, shampoos... The turn down service Turkish Delights were excellent, I regret not asking them where they got them, as the pre-boxed ones we brought home were not even close in texture or flavour. Bar, front desk, restaurant service were all very good+ and speaking only English was not a problem at all. The view of the Sea of the Mamara was very nice from their dining room and the two dinners and lunch we had there were very good. However, breakfast had limited local influence except for the cheeses, yogurt and a few of the breads. The scrambled eggs were wet, the \"sausages\" were what North Americans would call cheap beef wieners in Campbell's tomato soup. I found the juices, apple tea and an unsweetened hot chocolate excellent. The fruit, coffee and other teas were ok. All in all we should have gone out for breakfast more often, but we were limited because on three mornings we had tour buses picking us up and the timing just didn't work. There are many restaurants in all price ranges, which are an easy (easier than the main sites) walk away and 5-6 convenience stores in the area, which apply the \"variable pricing\" business model - it's based on what you look like, what you want, who's serving you... The differences shouldn't be much and you probably will not buy much from them but to reduce the surprise factor I thought I would just let you all know. Istanbul was fantastic and we very much enjoyed the three Koptur bus tours that were included with our Air Transat package.

The rooms are very small, clean and functional. My fourth-floor room was equipped with air conditioning - a must in July - and a wall-mounted TV with bad satellite reception of a few international channels.

Free wireless internet access is available throughout the hotel, but the signal was not strong enough for my iPad in my room. An internet PC with printer is available in the lobby. The staff are polite and helpful. The hotel tries hard to make its guests feel welcome, offering complimentary drinks and mezes in the lobby and distributing a daily inhouse newspaper (with a small box of \"Turkish Delight\") to each room. The decor is inviting, but the kitschy oil paintings of nude harem women in the public areas might not be to everybody's taste. Breakfast is adequate, but it's served on a seventh-floor terrace with a great view of the southern Bosporus and the sea of Marmara.

Here is a note about Pacha Tours. If you are looking for a reasonably priced tour to Turkey, definitely consider Pacha Tours. The itineraries they offer are great, the places we stayed were fine, and the restaurants were all good. Just keep this in mind, it is not a luxury tour. Some of the resaturants in the more rural areas will be in beautiful areas along a river bank or in the beautiful countryside, but they will be a little rustic. If you order fish, it will probably come cooked with a head and tail attached. You can always avoid that by ordering the chicken kebob, though. The hotels were all clean and safe, although not always in the most convenient locations. But be assured you are not spending a lot extra for a room you'll only spend one night in, anyway. Some of the hotels exceeded my expectations, such as the Aziyade in Istanbul, and the hotel in Cannakale.

The hotel is located in the less nicer part of Sultanhamet and you only need to go a few streets north or east of the hotel and things seem a lot nicer. The streets are quite cobbly and uphill into the main attractions of the Blue Mosque etc (on the positive side, its downhill on the way back to the hotel). In fairness, when we arrived at 3pm on Thursday, we were greeted by a complimentary hot Turkish tea and face cloth. That was about as nice as it got though. The reception staff on the 3 or 4 occassions we tried to get information were not very helpful. They weren't very informative about the Tours on offer, how to get to places and didn't speak very good english either. We actually booked our tours from another hotel further along as they made time to tell us what they had. The rooms are basic, dated and small. Beds are hard but all in all, if all you need is a place to sleep, then they are fine. You certainly don't feel the need to go back to the rooms to relax. Word of caution on the taxis...a taxi ride from the airport to the hotel should be no more than 30lira. From the hotel to the spice markets about 7 liras and over the bridge to the new town area about 15 lira. If you ask them how much, they will quote highly inflated figures...we paid 28 lira for a 10 minute ride to the spice market! If you ask them to run the meter, they have multiple meter readings and one must be for tourists as on another occassion it cost us 25lira. Given the airport is at least 4 times the distance, it doesn't make sense that a quick trip costs the same! We got duped again despite our insistance to use the meter. We then spoke to some locals who told us how much taxis should cost so for the third taxi ride we told them how much we would pay, and they accepted it! Never again, did we pay more than 15 lira (and that is still higher than their local fares) for a city trip. The most appaling thing though was the note switch trick. On 2 different occassions the taxi driver told us that we had underpaid him and switched a 10lira note for a 1 lira note. When this happened the second time, we stood firm that we hadn't underpaid as we counted our money before we got into the cab and he finally left us alone...wiser passengers! Despite the taxi and hotel debacles, we did enjoy Istanbul as it is a different city to Europe with lots to offer.

The hotel is conveniently located about a 10 to 15 min walk to the Blue Mosque / Hagia Sophia / Topkapi Palace and a Tram (street car) station. The walk is through narrow streets and up-hill for the first 5 minutes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so if you have difficulty walking you may want to take a cab. The hotel was very well maintained and clean and the staff was excellent. They offer a free breakfast, which was very good, and we ate dinner in the restaurant a few times and the food again was excellent and was at a reasonable price. The guest rooms vary in size quite a bit. I had asked for a non-smoking room and the only one available was too small for two people \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or in my opinion \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one person. We were given a much larger room but on a smoking floor. The room had an adjoining room and the wall between the two rooms was quite thin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we could easily hear the other guests talking in a regular voice. Luckily, the guests went to sleep by 10 PM and our sleep was not disturbed. Also, we found the bed very hard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you like a soft mattress this may be a problem. We did not make use of the Turkish bath or Sauna because of a 10 euro per person charge after 4:00 PM.

However, from looking at other hotels in the old city \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is clear that space is at a premium and I do not think you would find larger spa facilities at other hotels in this part of the city. They also had a very nice floor with meeting rooms and sitting rooms and free use of one computer for E-mail. The view from the hotel restaurant was very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you could see the Bosphorus and part of the old city.
