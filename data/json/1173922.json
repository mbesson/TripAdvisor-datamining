The bedroom was adequate with very limited wardrobes and not much draw space but OK for a few days. Bathroom tight but good. You should ask for rooms with a view over the creek (preferrably a high floor) which have an iconic vista of the high rise towers. Breakfast was a quite creditable buffet selection european style. You cannot use the lifts in the upwards direction without your room key and this is a good security feature. The Internet is free with just 3 terminals in the Reception Lobby and the Reception staff were outstanding throughout helping the visitors with a whole range of matters outside the hotel as well as inside. I knew that local phone calls were free to the population so whenever I needed the local rep of the travel agency I booked through, I just asked to call FOC from the reception desk which the staff were willing to do provided I kept the calls short. Our son used the bar extensively and once left his valuables there, which the staff honestly retrieved and kept safe until his return. Hotels are allowed, under licence, to serve alcohol but you will not find it easily elsewhere so bring your duty free. Taxis are available from outside and are supposedly inexpensive but ensure they turn the meter on. Now going into the historic centre by car is dire so plan your trip to the souks. Our driver got to know us over 2 days and we found the best deal is to pay by the hour (includes waiting time) when you know exactly where you want to go. You need to purchase/obtain a tourist map beforehand. We purchased somali frankincense and Myrrh in the spice market but go in a little way and the stalls become cheaper. The Gold souk boasts a corner shop with the largest gold ring in the world. it looked to be 30 inches in diameter and 15 inches long. Really bad traffic to get to it but difficult to get lost in the souks if you stay to the main malls. Easy walking distance of the abras (water ferries) which at 1 Dirham are a great photo opportunity. Back to the hotel. Go to the swimming pool in afternoon which has a 30 dirham charge in the internally connected adjoining Novotel. However if you buy a poolside drink then the 30 dirham charge is waived. Best to go in the afternoon say after 3pm when the sun has hit the water and warmed the pool. Clean toilets here and secure locker in the changing room all free of charge. Despite only being at 1st floor level the pool is shielded from traffic noise which can be significant outside the hotel. The Metro system is just 5 minutes walk away but remember Friday being the holy day is does not start until afternoon that day. We asked to check out late on one of the rooms the family took and paid a very reasonable 177 dirhams to use in until 6pm. Mind you the late checkout was negotiated on arrival so do not leave it until the last day, when the allocation might be gone. You need a room key each and we always left one key inserted in the room so we always came back to a cool room. It was 28+ degrees outside and this in january!Another perk of asking for a Creek View is you avoid direct sunlight into the rooms in the afternoon. Turn left out of the hotel and walk about 300 metres and you will find a beautiful airconditioned patisserie which looked good but we did not use. Go halfway back to the hotel and in a backstreet is a mosque which westerners cannot enter but go near sunset and see the worship hall all lit up and look at the chandelier. One of the biggest I have ever seen. I will not tell you what it looks like even from outside as that will be your treat. The Deira City Centre shopping mall has an information point where you can collect a shopping centre plan of all the units. We noted the price of Ipads were the same in Jacky's, Virgin Media and one other shop, it might be called D & J or something like that. It gets so hot only the tourist walk outdoors so similar to parts of Los Angeles but you must sightsee the beach area but if you have children and want a beach holiday this is not the hotel for you. One final perk of the location of this hotel. Apparently The Big Bus tours (open topped double deckers) leave from somewhere in the adjoining Deira City Centre shopping mall. We never used it because we had booked a full city sightseeing tour through our travel agent.

We got a taxi to the arabian courtyard (about 15 aed) to visit the pub there as didn't find the bar area that inviting and the Sherlock Holmes pub had a good atmosphere aswell as being cheaper. The hotel only took 5 mins from the airport by a taxi (35 aed).

The hotel is located around 10 minutes\u2019 drive from the airport, we did have a transfer booked through the tour operator, however they were plenty of taxis outside the airport which are easy to find and are well sign posted. Taxis are very reasonable and cost only a few pounds for that distance. Dubai is split in to 2 main areas \u2018Deria\u2019 and \u2018Jumira\u2019 divided down the centre by Dubai Creek. The hotel is located in the old city \u2018Deria\u2019 which is just outside of the centre of Dubai but within a short travel distance to all the main attractions via the tube system which is located about a 5 minute walk to the right of the hotel and runs in a straight line and is very easy to use \u2018Jebal Ali\u2019 will take you to wards the city and \u2018Rashyda\u2019 will take you back towards Deira, it is very cheap and you need to buy a day travel card from the ticket booth not the machines (ask for the red ones the blue are 2 day cards). Check in at the hotel is at 12 noon, be aware that this is fixed and they do not allocate rooms until this time \u2013 we arrived at 10am and was advised to go for a walk until our check in time. There is a locked baggage area to leave your bags if you do arrive early, and directly across from the hotel is \u2018Deria City Mall\u2019 which is a large shopping centre and a good escape from the heat. There is plenty of seating in the reception area with a drinks bar and free wireless service plus fully air-conditioned which is well needed. We stayed in a twin standard room on a Bed & Breakfast basis, the room was as expected from a Ibis hotel \u2013 clean basic but comfortable with full air-conditioning. There is a flat screen TV with some sky channels, the bathroom is small but well equipped and has the added bonus of toiletries. The view from the hotel is of the city and the mall, to be honest unless you choose a beach location at the \u2018Jumira\u2019 side of Dubai then this is the view you can expect from any hotel room and is not a negative in anyway. The breakfast is served in the restaurant on the ground floor and is served from 0630-1000, this is a buffet style service and has a really good selection of hot and cold items everything from the usual continental style fruit, pastries and meats to a full English. The hotel is situated next to the \u2018Novotel\u2019 and you will have free use of their restaurant in the evening s or the bistro in the \u2018Ibis\u2019 both restaurants serve a similar Italian menu \u2013 prices are no different to what you would pay in the UK. Tipping is customary for good service, around a couple of Dirims. Other than the usual chain restaurants in the Mall across from the hotel, there is a Turkish restaurant next door to the hotel, although it only takes around 20 minutes to Dubai Mall on the tube and you will find a great selection of restaurants in and around their and the \u2018Burj tower\u2019. We were informed that there is a pool and terrace bar at the Novotel of which for 30 Dirims you can use which is around \u00a35.50, although we never felt the need. Tip \u2013 It\u2019s worth noting that at the far side of \u2018Dubai City Mall\u2019 is the start point for the tour bus, which we found to be a fantastic way of visiting all the major attractions \u2013 they run a hop on hop off service and you can buy a 24 or 48 hour ticket which includes entry in to many of the major attractions, the bus stops everywhere it even takes you to Jumira Palm, where it stops at Atlantis. They also run a nonstop night service with a tour guide commentary (Air-conditioned and free water) the buses run every 30 min\u2019s up until late. Defiantly one to visit is the fountains under the \u2018Burj Tower\u2019 outside the Dubai Mall, from 1800 there is a light and water display from the fountains which is amazing to watch and runs every 20 minutes.

The biggest problem at this hotel was the staff, I am thinking of inventing a new word to describe how slow they are. It is probably because they are massively understaffed but check in took about an hour and check out just as long. If ever you have a problem there is no way on earth you can get a quick solution to it. There are always many people at the desk and if you use the phone in the room then you may as well just talk to yourself. We made about 3 requests such as extra pillow and not a single one was followed up. The rooms are clean and actually really nice. The hotel is also spotless. The manager of this hotel has no common sense either - The ridiculous price of a beer is \u00a37, thats not a typo - SEVEN POUND for 500ml of Beer. But if you want that beer and are staying at the IBIS you have to stay in the bar with it, if you are staying at the joining hotel (Novotel) you can take it to your room. The menu in the bar is poor and overpriced. Yet the room service menu is actually reasonable. Can you order an item off the room service menu and take it to the bar to have a drink with it - No. It is just ridiculous and completely ill thought out.

Furthermore it is a 5min walk away from the Dubai Metro which will basically bring you to most attractions in Dubai (Dubail Mall, Mall of the Emirates, Burj Khalifa etc) I arrived pretty early in Dubai and was happy to be able to check-in at 10am. One positive aspect was that they indeed provided me with a room that I requested. A few weeks before my stay I messaged them asking for a room on a higher floor facing the Burj Khalifa side (only visible on clear days though), and that is exactly what I got. The rooms are a typical Ibis size, not too big, but for me it was more than enough. It is clean and looked fresh, and that's all that I hoped and asked for.

Views were like everywhere in Dubai, artificial, since it's built on desert which means sand everywhere.

Breakfast was ok, not quite the ones that youre used to, but enough to start the day without being forced to go some cafe just to get your self fuelled for the day. Instead for paying ridiculous rates for the internet, just return to the CheckIn Lobby, since there you have Wi-Fi connection, if your computer is equipped with wireless. There was also 3 HP computers hooked to the internet by the Hotel, which where free to use. Reason to choose this hotel was it's location close to the NEW metro. Just few steps away and metro being the cheapest way to travel, it was really nice. With it you can get more/less to all those necessary places you might thing being worth a visit, e.g. Dubai Mall (IceRink, Aquarium, Burj Khalifa), Mall of the Emirates (SkiDubai), Palm Island Jumeirah (Hotel Atlantis, Aquaventures, Burgerfuel) and so on. In my opion the down side of Dubai is the difficulty of walking anywhere, since it's build and equipped that way that you ALWAYS have to take a taxi to get anywhere, even you first use the metro. Then again there is system that fixes the prices, so it's always even money, yet the meter first shows 41,70, but after you give 50, it's even 50.. Also Lexus taxis are pretending to be taxis, yet there is no rateemeters and the prices are divided to 35 UAED's depending on the distance. Short is 35, next is 70 and after that it is 105 and so on. So when having metro to Jumeirah it was 4,20, compared to normal taxi which was 48,70 so 50 and might have been with Lexus service something like 105 or even the next level so 140 uaed.

First off, I do write long reviews so bear with me. We didn't have a great deal of money and were staying in Dubai for three nights. As much as we'd have loved to find the deal a friend of mine found (six nights at Atlantis, with flights, for \u00a3600 - unfortunately his wife went and booked a week in Wales) we asked our travel agent to find us the cheapest there was, and he found this - the Ibis Deira City Centre. Some relatives actually had stayed there a year before and found it very nice and in a great location. So off to Dubai we go! We'd actually flown to Melbourne, done some stuff there, then to Sydney, and now Dubai on the way back to Manchester. In order to save some more money we were actually flying into Abu Dhabi and travelling into Dubai on a coach but that's another story. Long plane flight, coach trip and then taxi ride later we arrived at probably about 9am. Fair enough. The hotel is actually on a main road (isn't everything in Dubai?) and is opposite the Deira City Centre shopping mall. Although check in isn't until 2pm we go in anyway and try our luck. As luck would unfortunately have it, nothing is available. The staff did say we could try at 1pm and see if there's anything then, so plus marks there for the staff offering that, and minus luck marks for us. The staff did offer to hang onto our luggage for us, which we were grateful for, and we went to the shopping centre to kill a few hours, then came back at 1-ish and found that a room was available. I must mention that, despite being billed as \"very cheap\" according to the travel agent, the standards were very good. The hotel foyer looked clean with three PCs set up for use and international newspapers. The room was also nice - plenty of space, a decent enough bed and a spacious bathroom with walk-in shower and line to hang towels on. Definitely better than expected. Only real problem was that I was woken up at 5am (I think) by what I assume is the \"call to prayer\". Never mind - that's an issue with Dubai itself, not the hotel as the noise was coming from outside. The view from where we were was also pretty good - you could see across the shopping mall to the Burj Khalifa (definitely something worth doing). The TV also picked up a large amount of TV stations, along with a lot of western stuff (given the amount of nudity there is in True Blood you would have thought it wouldn't be screened, but there it is). The breakfast was also decent - an okay variety of warm and cold food including breads, cereals, sausages, beans, toast, juice and others. Nothing spectacular though it was better than the comparatively bland breakfasts I'd had at other places on our trip in Australia. Though check out was at about 10am we were flying back at 2am and so would need our luggage held until about 9pm (otherwise we couldn't do anything and would die of boredom). Again, the hotel kindly held our luggage for us until we came back and used a taxi (they're everywhere in Dubai! Just walk out of the hotel and there's normally three there waiting!) to get to the airport. I will briefly note that, though it didn't affect us, the hotel does not have swimming facilities, though for a small supplement you can use the facilities at the neighbouring Novotel. We found this hotel to be in a good spot - again, across the road from the Deira City Centre shopping mall (good for all your shopping needs, though nowhere near as spectacular as the Dubai Mall) and about three minutes walk from a metro station. Taxis were available and we found the neighbourhood (well, our short walks to the metro) to be one where we felt safe (having said that, Dubai is supposed to be one of the safest places around). The hotel was good value - nothing spectacular, but it's not going to be. The breakfast was good and it had all the amenities necessary. I wasn't sure whether to award a three or a four star. I think that, for the price and value for money, as well as the helpfulness of the staff (they did try to help when we asked them about Ferrari World and the metro, but unfortunately didn't know much about them) I think I'll award it four.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "GREECE&CYPRUS", "Title": "\u201cBest Location for One or Two Nights!\u201d", "Author": "greekcypriot2009", "ReviewID": "UR90143223", "Content": "We spent one evening at Ibis Hotel at Deira in late September 2010.

The downside was the absence of room service .Breakfast was extra,over the room rate and appeared expensive as per normal standard.Even the reception takes a long to lift the phone in case of a query and always appear overbusy.No wifi internet in the rooms and even the wired room internet was expensive from hotel or Dubai standards.Apart from City Centre or other malls there were no \"bazars\" to stroll around if one prefers that.Be careful about check-in times.Generally it is difficult to get a room before the prescribed check-in time and often becomes a problem as travellers mostly plan flights which arrive in the mornings to take full day time advantage.

I was not allowed to check in at 1300 hours at my confirmed reservation because I did not have in my possession my original passport. My passport is with an embassy that I'm applying a visa for. Needless to say, I am in-transit in Dubai. I've informed the IBIS reception staff that I have a SCANNED copy of my passport temporarily till I get my passport back from the afternoon that same afternoon. I was initially told that I must also have a SCANNED copy of the IMMIGRATION stamp when I entered Dubai for their records. I've informed them that this is the first time that I've needed that to check-in for a hotel (immigration stamp). The reception staff (Mr. Hafi) also informed me that they MUST see the ORIGINAL PASSPORT of the guest because they cannot just trust to accept a scanned copy of someone's passport since anybody can manipulate a digital copy of a passport. According to him, all other hotels in the UAE that accept a digital copy of one's passport is WRONG and in violation of policy. I FELT THAT I WAS CHECKING-IN AT A POLICE STATION AND NOT IN A HOTEL. I believe it is the intent of Dubai to be a business hub of Asia and for us travelers to be able to conduct business and check-in a hotel without being judged as to digitally manipulate a copy of my passport. Please take note, I have an online reservation and have used my CREDIT CARD. I DID NOT just walk in the lobby and said please give me a room. Even if one did, I think a true HOTEL would consider SERVICE FIRST (like other hotels in the UAE) rather than letting a guest wait for 2 hours UNABLE to check-in till he gets his passport from an embassy. POOR JUDGMENT on IBIS Hotel management here in Dubai if you ask me. Get in line with the rest of the hotels in the region of the middle east and THINK OF YOUR GUEST first. YOU DO NOT WAREHOUSE PEOPLE and PASS JUDGMENT ON THEM and USE the excuse that it is DUBAI POLICE POLICY. Remember, other hotels (5 and 4 Stars) that I've stayed in Dubai do not do this. SHAME ON YOU.

Overall good value for money and would definitely stay there again. I however found the prices of the food at the restaurant very expensive, sandwiches (18dhs) , small bottled water (8dhs), internet (wow 25dhs!!). Tips, there is a food court at the diera shopping mall, directly opposite the hotel, so you can always dash across for your meals (from 8dhs) to getting bottled water from carrefour (3 dhs). There is an internet cafe, just three buildings before Ibis (next to the old diera shopping centre), where you can browse for an hour for 7DHS.the cafe also has a small restaurant and bottled water also sells for 3dhs.

The hotel is only a 10 minute taxi ride from the airport and, although we were too early to check-in, the staff were extremely helpful. We changed from warm English clothing into lighter wear, left our luggage in the safe keeping of the staff at the Ibis, and hit the town! When we returned at mid-day to check in we found the staff extremely helpful, welcoming and polite. Our twin bedded room (with shower room) was excellent, clean and comfortable . Although there were no tea/coffee making facilities this was not a problem at all. We had breakfast the following morning sat on the patio! The food was plentiful and good, well worth 55 dhr, and this set us up for the next few hours of shopping and sightseeing. The hotel is situated directly across the road from a great shopping mall, complete with Carrefour supermarket, and just a few minutes walk from the new metro station. We used the metro to get to the Mall of the Emirates and back again. Taxi fares to the gold and spice souks were about 10 drms (\u00a32 or less), and to ride across the creek in an abra (a great experience) was 1 drm (20p). It was interesting to talk to people and find out about the boats etc on the creek - everyone was so friendly and helpful. The Hotel Ibis was a great choice and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. The locality was perfect for getting to everywhere we wanted to go - we would definitely stay again and use it as a base for our time in Dubai.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jindabyne", "Title": "\u201cwatch out\u201d", "Author": "Sn0wyriver", "ReviewID": "UR50601155", "Content": "booked the hotel because of transfer to and from airport - they got rid of this service without informing the arriving guests price quoted on the internet/website - arrive there and you will pay more! their advantage is the convenient location arrogant people at reception (night manager)", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SWELLENDAM", "Title": "\u201cWILL STAY THERE AGAIN\u201d", "Author": "SWELLENDAM", "ReviewID": "UR49320425", "Content": "We stayed in this Hotel for 5 nights (married couple) and i will do it again in the future.Location is perfect,rooms is clean and staff is very nice.This Hotel is a bargain comparing with other Hotels.It is still very new ,the morning buffet breakfast is ok and is all one needs.If i can make a recommendation it will be to place coffee/tea making facilities in the room.Taxis is available 24 hours and the nearest metro station is only 150m away.Just accross the street is the Deira City Cente Shopping Mall.

Not more than ten minutes by cab from Terminal 1. Only a very short wait during check-in. The guy there was real friendly and offered us immediatelly after we asked for a room on the eight floor. The room was not that large but spacious enough with two separate beds. No airport noise, but it was possible to follow the planes from the window. Shower only in the bathroom but clean at all and no noise from the rooms beside. Breakfast was also not expensive, buffet style, everything there what we need and also real good to eat outdoor in the warm morning wind.

I found the room a bit small, but since just me and my best friend were going to share, that was not a problem. However the wardrobe is designed without a door, and there are no drawers in the room at all. we searched high and low! you dont get a mini bar, you dont get a hairdryer for your room, you dont get a iron or ironing board. the hairdryer i had to beg the staff for and they told me they were all being used, only when i shouted at the manager, was i provided with a new one which i then hid in my suitcase and only returned it when i left. iron and irnoning board we had to request from the porter each time we needed it, in the bathroom we only had two towels which was a bit of a nightmare - one bath size and one hand towel. and the bathroom toiletrrie, well it was all in one, hand wash body wash shampoo conditioner, all in one bottle. I am used to having all the above as i only ever stay at 4 or 5 star hotels, but since i travel so oftent o dubai, i settled for ibis. Oh, and there is no room service for food and drinks,so if you need a cup of tea, you must carry it to your room yourself, as there are no tea making facilities in the room either! despite the lack of all BASIC ROOM PROVISIONS, i would stay here again, as its very clean, the staff is very nice and its cheap for people who want to be out shopping all day . bit of a shame though , wish ibis would provide all the basics. the next door accor hotel has all of the above and actually is not much dearer.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands England", "Title": "\u201cNICE ENOUGH\u201d", "Author": "Wrant", "ReviewID": "UR46435779", "Content": "GOOD POINTS -- Cheap for Dubai, clean, helpful staff, near the metro/bus routes, near a mall, cheap food nearby. BAD POINTS, Poor breakfast choice, not a great location for sightseers, not suitable for anyone wanting to walk anywhere, small rooms. DETAILS My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights, it was one of the cheaper hotels but was acceptable for our needs. It is just 5 mins taxi ride from the airport and just across the road from a mall. Food and drink is expensive in UAE but the mall has a food hall with some great choices at good prices,try the freshly cooked Italian food outlet. I was not taken with Dubai and although I would recommend this hotel, I would not recommend staying in Dubai. It is just one large building site and unless you want to spend a lot of money there is not a lot to do. Shopping prices are the same as in the UK. The Metro is very good and cheap but has a limited coverage I would recommend getting a silver pass that allows you bus and metro travel combined, just keep topping it up as you need to. You can only pay at the metro or bus stations if you do not have a pass you can not jump on a bus and pay cash. When you get on the bus you swipe you card make sure that when you get off you swipe it again (ensure that it registers) or you will get a maximum fare deducted.", "Date": "October 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cFine\u201d", "Author": "Emissary", "ReviewID": "UR45495322", "Content": "Excellent price (Dhs 295).

All of the staff that we spoke to during our 4 night stay were kind, friendly and very helpful. There is also a free shuttle bus to the beach which you need to pre-book at reception, the times are leaving the hotel at 9am or 12pm and coming back at 3pm or 5pm. The beach charges 5dhs per person to get in. I could not really fault the hotel, our room was big enough for two people, always clean, the bathroom although compact was no problem at all. The shopping mall was just outside my window too! just a little word of warning, when you get into the lifts make sure you put your room card in the slot then take out when you see the green light press the required floor otherwise the lift will not move! this was not explained to us at the reception desk but found out by getting stuck in the lift.

Dubai as said is an expensive city , and to find a Hotel at USD 100 was understandable . But this Hotel is a TWO STAR Hotel in terms of service or you can say No frill hotel . You just need to go to sleep at the end of the day and its for the same . There is no entertainment in Room , TV Reception poor , Small Room and Very Small Bathroom , No Toiletries , nothing just one bath gel . You need to pick your luggage from the Pick up Bus. For me I was fortunate to find an Indian Guy who was actually a security but helped me . IBIS is near to Novotel ,and is interconnected . Its Clean and No doubt about that , you can straight away go to City Centre which is walking distance from Hotel . Taxis are no easy available , and Hotel do not help on this. The only way is take a Hotel Cab which is going to cost atleast 30 Dhms and further if you get a Taxi its good . Its near to Airport around 20 Min , but Pick up faciltiy is too bad , I mean they have a shuttle and if you miss one then its not necesary the next will be half an hour only for me it took one hour from Airport to Hotel ( waiting for the shuttle) But the Guy was good so he helped me finding something to eat etc . IBIS has nothing to offer you , Absolutely Nothing , Even Bar has nothing to eat, except beer and Break fast has no good menu . All the while it has been mixed kind for me . But if you are looking for Cost Effective , neat and safe place , Go for it . But do not go if you want to have a Good Services etc .
