The service was professional. The quality of the breakfast was also at the level of the hotel.

Arrived at the entrance that was e-mailed to me. There was no one there and if you don't read the really small sign telling you to call up when you arrive on the 1st floor you will not be able to check in at reception. The hotel is in a historic building and it really is quite an experience as this was the old police headquarters which have been converted into a heritage centre. The building has been left intact including the old stairs and facade. When you walk down to the restaurant along the narrow passageway you can't help thinking of the history that the walls hold. First the good: the bed is amazing in the Stanley Suite, it is comfortable and you can just melt into sleep. The balcony with your private sitting area is also spectacular as you have partial views of the Hong Kong skyline. There is also a free mini bar service and free wifi. The amenities in the bathroom are comprehensive and smell divine. However, there are many things which need improvement. Now the improvements: The key card was a used one which had the previous guests name tippexed out and ours written in. This is tacky and not something I would expect from this kind of establishment. The room is showing wear and tear and the hotel has not been open for long. The material on one of the chairs has ripped and the tap in the bathroom is missing the hot sign. There is a sense that you are not actually in a hotel and there is no list of services that the hotel offers. The rooms are vacuous and the space has not been used well which makes you feel like you are sleeping in a cave rather than in a cosy heritage room. The actual hotel is not user friendly and the flow is not pleasant for a guest. Breakfast was pleasant but the service in the restaurant was disappointing. The waiter did not smile once or even attempt to be friendly. For those wanting privacy this is a good hotel. But when the rate is the same as the Peninsula and I compare what you get just one block away, I am sorry to say that I would rather stay at the Peninsula than here.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPolice Headquarters into a spectacular hotel\u201d", "Author": "Billy W", "ReviewID": "UR125006703", "Content": "Hong Kong loves demolishing its heritage buildings, so the the Victorian-era marine police headquarters at the tip of the Kowloon peninsula being made into a hotel is a welcome development.

We decided to spend our last night in a special hotel and we considered the usual options - Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, Conrad etc - and had we chosen one of them they would, I'm sure, have been excellent. But we decided that we didn't want big and impersonal, however good, and opted instead for Hullett House Hotel. It's part of 1881 Heritage in the former Marine Police headquarters - a rare thing in Hong Kong where redevelopment seldom means anything other than knocking down old and replacing with new. The building is grand colonial and we had eaten at some of the restaurants and drunk in some of the bars. There are just ten very large rooms in the hotel which open onto a wonderful terrace. Despite the featureless Cultural Centre opposite blocking the Harbour from view, there is still a glimpse of the magical skyline of Hong Kong Island. We chose the Stanley suite as we wanted something soothing rather than the sensory overload of the decor in some of the rooms, and it was perfect. The bathroom, like the bedroom, was massive with a wonderful bath and separate rainforest shower. Service was faultless. We had a problem with hot water which was corrected immediately. With just ten rooms it is very quiet and we hardly saw any other guests. This wouldn't suit everyone but it was just what we needed after a frantic few weeks. Location is great, a short walk from the Star Ferry and from Tsim Sha Tsui underground station and right beside Harbour City shopping centre - with prices a bit less eye-watering than those in most of the shops in 1881. Access is a bit unusual. The entrance is on Kowloon Park Drive from where you take a lift to the reception. Someone came down to collect our baggage but it did take a little while. When you're not checking in or out you can enter through 1881. Hullett House is very different to the other 5 star offerings in Hong Kong. We found it the ideal escape for the hustle and bustle and will definitely stay again when we're back in the city.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing, China", "Title": "\u201cExceptionnal hotel made for lifetime memories!\u201d", "Author": "Richard79087", "ReviewID": "UR115237866", "Content": "We stayed there for our honeymoon and it couldn't have been a better place to live: the hotel is the oldest building of HK and now a superb boutique hotel which has kept all the charm of its history and heritage, while being very modern and artistic in its interior design.

It\u2019s an exclusive boutique hotel located inside the former Marine Police headquarters, cleverly restored without sacrificing any of its former glory I suspect.

(The manager explained all this to us while he gave us the \"grand tour\" of this amazing building. There's so much history; I never knew this about Hong Kong...) Best of all, you\u2019re right in the heart of this vibrant city. And while being touched by the ancient history, you remain thankfully untouched by the noise and madness that is Tsimshatsui. The hotel has a selection of spacious suites, each of which are completely different, representing a different period in Hong Kong's history. We chose the suite called \u201cShek O\u201d. The splendid and somewhat sinfully decadent decor, paired with the superb service really brought back the magic of travel that we've been missing for so long. The suite we had gave us a stunning view of the Hong Kong skyline from your own private balcony (already this feature made our stay worthwhile).

The hotel is amazingly well decorated and the staff are fabulous. The breakfast is probably the best scrambled eggs I have ever had...
