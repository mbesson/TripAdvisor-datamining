They booked us for the cheapest room (full size bed), which there listing implied that the bed was a queen. They did not indicate that parking has to be reserved with hotel as they have limited spaces. Having said all that - when we got to the hotel, the staff was able to address all of our concerns - which took them quite a bit of effort as they were nearly fully booked - and they did so at no cost. The hotel itself is wonderful. It is a boutique hotel - services are a bit limited - but the rooms are nice, staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel is 1 building off from the beach, 5 min. walk from Shopping in Condado, while on a quiet street. The restaurant in the hotel is pricy, but some of the best food around San Juan.

Poor Room Block Management\u201d", "Author": "mychaeljacobnyc", "ReviewID": "UR126885731", "Content": "First time I've had to submit an unfavorable review, so forive me if I stumble through this one. My wife & I are frequent travelers and I'm proud at the number of my reviews that have been read on this website, ( 3 reviews away from Senior Reviewer Badge).. This website has served us well over the past few years, so you can imagine our surprise at how far off the strong reviews of this hotel was; compared to our experience. * First I want to accenuate the positives: 1.) hotel located in safe neighborhood Condado. 2.) kudos to the housekeeping staff/rooms were kept clean. 3.) nice semi-private beach 1/2 block from hotel. ** Full Disclosure- we recognize that amenities vary on the importance scale from each individual/group or couple. What may be a deal breaker for some may not be for others. But what I do want to bring to anyone considering this location is first the definition of convenient. I saw on other reviews that this hotel was convenient to shopping, etc.. My wife & I are New Yorkers and no strangers to walking, and we found the walk to the nearest shopping area a little further than your standard defintion of convenient. It is a pleasant walk, but do not attempt this walk in sandals. HA.. *** Addressing the Poor Room Management: Our Check In was South of \"warm & fuzzy\". Instead we were greeted with indifference. Nothing better than having the Front Desk Attendant (first name began with an S) acting as if she was doing us a favor by checking us in. Please dont confuse indifferent with rude, because the exchange was pleasnat. However, when you give the owner a compliment of \"nice place\" and you get answered with \"all smoke & mirrors\" you start to wonder if they are in the wrong business. HA What confirmed my suspicion was the room they gave us, room 207. The room had (2) King Beds (if you call 2 twin beds put togther a king) that was very narrow and claustrophobically tight. I noticed the room right next to ours was empty with a much nicer king bed and definitely better suited for a Couple. The hotel was at maybe 20% occupancy, and when I inquired with the same front desk attendant if the Empty room next door was a higher rate than ours, I was told it was the same rate!! I had to ask myself, if you see we are a couple on a romantic get away weekend, and you have a much nicer, EMPTY room at the same rate available, why would you give a couple a cramped (2) king bed room??? Poor Room Block Management!! In closing this \"boutique\" hotel is run by individuals who either know very little about simple hospitality or just dont care. We could handle the fact the property has no elevator, only stairs that are exposed to the elements to your room (like rain in our case),or if you wanted a snack & simple cup of coffee you have to walk accross the street to their sister property. In reality it falls short with amenities you would find at even 3 star hotels, and couples would do better staying at a chain hotel further down the road where you are truly walking distance to shops and most importantly treated as a valued guest.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tarrytown, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat, if you are only looking for beach vacation\u201d", "Author": "Jenifer H", "ReviewID": "UR126711676", "Content": "Stayed @ Acacia for recent escape from NYC.

I would give it a complete 5 points but for us it was a bit far from Old San Juan. We had already spent a week at the beach in other parts of the island so we were not drawn to the beach close to the hotel. It is a public beach with volleyball, swimming, ect, but also very crowded compared to the beaches around the island. Fof this reason we spent most of our time in Old San Juan which is AMAZING but a 15 minute drive away. Supposedly there is a bus that runs their easily, but we were very happy to have a car to make the trip there and back. Next point is parking is an extra fee and a must if you have a car. We parked illegally for 10 minutes outside the hotel and recieved a $250 parking ticket, FYI.

When we checked in, Chad, the manager said he'd credit our accounts with the 10%, but ultimately came up with a lame excuse not to honor the discount stating our rooms were already discounted (we were booked for new years week and the price we paid ($185 for a king size and $175 for the queen) was higher than the prices listed on the back of the hotel room doors. These were not discounted prices). Upon arrival, we found that they sold one of our king sized bedrooms to some one else. Instead, they tried to sell us a moldy smelling room with no windows, tucked behind the kitchen. Ultimately, they found a queen sized room that was adequate. Our other room, a king size, had two twin beds tied together. The rooms were pleasant, although quite small. One room didn't have a closet. The balcony furniture was the stackable plastic stuff one buys at KMart. The wireless network didn't have a strong enough signal to reach the rooms on the second or third floor, so even though they advertise wireless internet, it's not available. On the day we checked in, we had asked about finding a gym to work out at. The desk clerk had no idea where to recommend, but he did find us a gym, on our last night there. This is a hotel that tries to be a three or four star hotel, but I've had better service at Motel 6.

Typically when a hotel has so many positive reviews on TripAdvisor you're pretty much guaranteed a fantastic stay, but I didn't find that to be the case here. We spent $185/night for a room with a balcony and partial ocean view, but what we got was a small area between our door and the hot tub with a view of the people in the hot tub. There was no privacy, but our balcony had no chairs to sit on anyway. The staff told us we could take other people's chairs. In fact, our room didn't have a chair either. What it had was two twin beds pushed together, a dresser, a metal rod for hanging clothes and a flat screen tv. The bed is a little short if you're 6'3\" (my legs were hanging off the end and this killed my back, although the hot tub straightened it out). Is this worth $185/night? You could probably find something a lot less expensive for these amenities. The staff was very nice, though the only information we got upon checking in was where the ice machine was. They told me they needed my credit card for incidentals and I thought it was a joke. I don't know what we could have bought. They do have a restaurant where you can buy 30$ pizzas. They are close to a very nice beach, although in December the trade winds are so strong that it seems too cold and rough to swim. Getting to Old San Juan is a $20 taxi ride. Ocean Park and Condado are okay but not nearly as nice as Old San Juan. This was my 6th time in the Caribbean, my first in Puerto Rico. This was the most money I'd ever spent on accommodations, so I expected it to at least be as good as the places I've stayed in the Dominican Republic, Trinidad & Tobago, St. Lucia and Barbados.

There is no shortage of choice in SJ, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m so glad we stayed here. We got a welcome that you just don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get at a chain and we were directed to our room. The room itself has everything you need. Ours was on the first floor and looked out towards the beach (which you could see a bit of) with a small balcony, air con, ceiling fan and a charming, unusual bathroom.

They were so accommodating as they had a spare room. They hired us a room for the 5 hours, allowed us and the children to use the hot tub and the pool. They also gave us enough towels to each have a shower and freshen up before the hike back to London. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what hospitality is all about. Thank you.

We go to San Juan at least 2 -3 times a year and usually stay in Condado. This time, we wanted to stay in a quite area close to Condado, and after debating between Acacia and another hotel in the neighborhood, we decided to stay at Acacia Boutique Hotel, solely based on all the good reviews that Acacia received. The hotel is located in Ocean Park, relatively quiet residential area, approximately 10 minute walk from Condado and about 1 block away from the beach. Other travelers seem to rely on buses and taxis. Buses cost you 75 cents to Old San Juan. But, any time we go to San Juan, we usually rent a car from Charlie Car Rental (we reserve prior to coming to San Juan). Buses are somewhat unreliable. During the summer, we waited for a bus for an hour to get to Old San Juan and nothing ever came and we finally gave up . Taxis are not cheap to get around. Car rentals, however, are extremely cheap in San Juan. For the entire 8 days, we paid $175 in total, averaging $22 a day (I imagine that this is close to one way cab ride to Old San Juan, including tip). We took the shuttle to Charlie Car Rental in Isla Verde from the airport and drove ourselves to the hotel. As it is quite difficult to find a parking space near the hotel, we reserved a parking space at At Wind Chimes Inn (Acacia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sister hotel), which cost $10 a night. The parking space is very small and is limited, and can accommodate only a few economy size cars. So, if you are thinking of renting a car, definitely reserve a parking space well in advance. Once you get to the hotel, the front desk will supply you with the beeper to open the gate at the parking. At Wind Chimes Inn is located on McLeary Street, which gets pretty busy depending on the time of the day. So, backing out onto the street with traffic can get tricky at times. Nevertheless, we like the freedom of just jumping into a car and driving wherever, without relying on the public transportation, which we found to be somewhat unreliable (although we saw many more buses drive by this time). Getting back to Acacia, we were there for 8 days from December 7th through 14th. The hotel is dog friendly. So, we stayed with our 2 well behaved Chihuahuas (we love traveling with our dogs and we never leave them behind. We look specifically for dog friendly accommodations when we travel to Caribbean. St. Martin is another good place for dogs). The hotel charges a small fee per night for dogs, about $20 a night, if I remember correctly. The hotel is quite small and intimate, 3 floors with no elevators. It is all white and the architecture has \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mediterranean\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd feel to it. By the way, be very careful when you go down the stairs, especially when it rains. The stairs get quite slippery. I fell down quite badly after the rain, walking down the stairs with flip flops, which had no grip. I hit my hip and elbow pretty badly, and I was in pain for days. Since then, I walked down the stairs barefoot even at night and carrying my heals when we went out for dinner. The area is not well lit either at night, particularly the 3rd floor. When you check into the hotel, the front desk will provide you with a room key, which also opens the front door to the hotel. Check-in is from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. We arrived at the airport earlier. But, we opted to have lunch at one of our favorite restaurants in Condado, Ummo Argentinean Grill and arrived at the hotel shortly past 2 p.m. Check-in was quite efficient. They took the credit card information and showed us around the hotel and its facility, although we knew the way around, since we came to check out the hotel during our last trip in the summer. The hotel helped us with our luggage, and we were in our room, in no time. Check-out is quite early, at 11 a.m. Our flight did not leave till later. So, we requested a late check-out, at 1 p.m. The hotel will also hold your luggage for you after you check out and I believe that there is a room that you can use to shower etc. If this is not what you want, you can make arrangements with the hotel to stay in your room later, provided that there are no other guests arriving on that day. However, the hotel charges $25 an hour for every hour past 11 a.m. you would like to stay in your room. We paid $50 additional fee to stay in our room till 1 p.m. We reserved a King Deluxe room and stayed in room 308. We liked the location of our room, as the room is situated in the corner on the top floor, and no one will walk by our room to get to his/her room. The room was very clean and decorated very nicely. We had a king size bed with a canopy hanging over from the ceiling (the mattress was on the firm side but comfortable), large flat screen TV with cable (i.e., English channels), drawer space to put your clothes, and A/C, which worked very well. The room had no alarm clock. The bathroom had shower only, which didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us and the shower had nice hot water at all times of the day, unlike some other hotels in the neighborhood. The hotel supplies you with basic amenities such as shampoo, conditioner, soap and had hair drier, iron and small ironing board. The only drawback was that the room was extremely small, and so was the bathroom. There was no closet space to hang your clothes. There was a space to hang your clothes in the bathroom. But, once you hang your clothes, there was hardly any space to move around in the bathroom. I think that the rooms situated next to us (rooms 307 and 306) were much larger (we sort of peaked in). The room had a safe. But, when we first arrived, the prior guest did not return the key. So, we could not use it for the first 2 days. But, the hotel quickly changed the lock when we brought to the attention of the front desk. The hotel charges a small fee, about $2 a night to use the in-room safe. The view from the hotel room and from the Jacuzzi (the hotel is known for having the largest Jacuzzi, which is 34 x 12 with 18 water jets and a heating system that everyone rave about) is ok. You can see the ocean one block away behind the palm trees. But, because the hotel is located in the residential area, it is surrounded by much taller condos. So, you will have a view of whole bunch of buildings, which I would say is not the nicest. The hotel breakfast was excellent. The hotel has a very small restaurant, Niche, downstairs and there is a very small outdoor part. This is where we had breakfast, as the inside of the restaurant is too dark and too cold with A/C in the morning. Some travelers mentioned that the breakfast at Niche was expensive and some opted to go to Kasalta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, very popular deli with the locals, located on McLeary Street, about 5- 10 minute walk. We were actually so surprised to see that the prices were very reasonable for the hotel breakfast and the price difference was not much different from Kasalta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (except in Kasalta's, the line to order food can get long) . Breakfast at Niche averaged between $5 and maybe $12, very comparable to New York City prices. Blueberry pancakes were excellent, as other travelers mentioned in their reviews. But, my favorite was French toast with strawberry cottage cheese. That was quite amazing. Coffee is excellent and freshly made (it is the equivalent of triple espresso in NYC). You cannot get bad coffee in Puerto Rico. We had breakfast at Niche a few times. But, we also drove to Uvva Restaurant at Hosteria del Mar a few times (this is actually the hotel we were debating to stay). We also loved Uvva Restaurant, as the hotel/restaurant is located directly on the beach and it makes you feel like you are truly on vacation in Caribbean (the price range of the breakfast is very similar to Niche). We did not have breakfast at Kasalta\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. But ,we went for pastries and coffee and actually bought some pastries to take home with us to New York City. They were fresh and very good. Our only regret was that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t buy more. We had dinner at Niche on our first night. The food here was good, as we experience when we came just for dinner during the summer. Since we woke up very early to travel to San Juan and had not much sleep, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to drive to get to other restaurant. The portion at Niche was quite large, as we remembered. So, we ordered two appetizers and shared one entr\u00c3\u00a9e and dessert, and it was more than enough. The restaurant itself for dinner is not very cheap. For the remaining days, we drove to all of our favorite restaurants. Our favorite places, that we never miss when we are in San Juan are Ummo Argentinean Grill (excellent steak), Budatai (We recommend ordering whole bunch of appetizers. We love their foie gras, Hirame with coconut sauce, eel role, Asian style octopus (pulpo) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Puerto Rican restaurants really know how to prepare octopus \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very tender and never chewy like in Sushi bars), and of course, Pikayo for their excellent food and attentive service (We have been going to Pikayo for years every since the restaurant was located in the Museum. But, they moved to Conrad hotel a while back, which is much easier to get to. They always bring for us our favorite appetizer on the house. Desset not to be missed their cheese souffl\u00c3\u00a9 with guava sauce). This time, we also tried Casa Lola, Chef Roberto Trevino\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s newest restaurant and newest addition to Budatai and Bar Gitano, Pamela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located at Numero 1 Guest House. We also like Marmalade Restaurant in Old San Juan. But, we did not make it there this time. Casa Lola was very good (particularly fried cheese appetizer with passion fruit sauce and also foie gras). But, the portion was so large. Next time, we will stick to just ordering a few appetizers and no entr\u00c3\u00a9e. We recommend trying these restaurants in San Juan. San Juan is filled with great restaurants. All restaurants mentioned above are in Condado, with exception of Marmalade. I made dinner reservation via Open Table before we left for San Juan. This way, we can accumulate points. By the way, the hotel has wi-fi at the lobby. But, you can also connect, if you are in the balcony area outside of the room. For some reason, my cell phone reception (Verizon) was not very good and I did not get any emails on my blackberry. Maybe this was a sign that I should not be checking any work emails while I was on vacation. However, my boyfriend who had AT&T had good reception. During the day, we simply relaxed at the beach. Compared to other Caribbean islands, we must say that the San Juan beach is not the best (it is quite wavy and does not have the crystal turquoise blue water and white sand). But, the Ocean Park beach is generally pretty (Some places have lots of sea weed and it is a shame that it is not cleaned up) with miles of golden color sand. We took a walk on the beach with our dogs every night. We loved the fact that it is quite safe at night. We did not even think about going to the beach at night when we stayed in Condado. It just did not feel very safe. We saw some one\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s car being broken into during the day time. So, being able to walk around the beach at night was a big plus. It is quite romantic too, with moonlight shining on the water. During the day, especially late afternoon, we were surprised that the beach got quite crowded with young locals. We read somewhere that the Ocean Park beach had increasingly become very popular with young locals. But, compared to the Condado beach, it is still more quiet. The hotel mentioned on our first day that they had four beach chairs available for free, on the first come first served basis (they are kept around the front desk area). However, we only saw two, one of which was broken, for the first couple of days, and after that none. So, you have the option of laying on the beach towels (the hotel supplies you with the beach towels but they are not very big) and use a very tiny beach chair if you are lucky enough to find it (it is probably not very comfortable if you are not built small). What we did while we stayed at Acacia was walk over to Numero 1 Guest House. They are located directly on the Ocean Park beach. You can get to the beach first and walk along the beach for about 5 minutes. If you order drinks, or say you will be ordering lunch from their restaurant, Pamela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the hotel staff will hook you up with nice comfy beach chairs (i.e., real beach chairs), beach table, and umbrella for free. So, this is what we did every day pretty much. We tip the hotel staff between $5 and $7 for providing a great service to us. When we had dinner at Pamela\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s for dinner, we were not that impressed. Perhaps, we did not order the right dishes. But, we loved having lunch there (their menu for lunch was pretty much the same as dinner menu except for sandwiches). We loved the scallop ceviche, curry crab salad, and pulled pork sandwich with plantains. However, the food here is quite expensive. Sandwiches ran about $18. But, since they are humongous, if you split with another person, it will be more than enough. Nevertheless, we loved the convenience of having the lunch/drink service and being able to relax and be comfortable at the beach, rather than sitting on our towes or using a very tiny beach chair that the hotel offered. Also, the area around Numero 1 Guest House stayed sunnier a lot later than the area near Acacia, as there are no tall buildings to block the sun. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at Acacia and no major complaints. The hotel room was clean, and comfortable despite the size, and in good safe location, just a block away from the beach, with very friendly staff at the front desk. So, if you are looking for a large hotel experience with lots of restaurants, big swimming pool (Acacia has no swimming pool, although you can use the pool at At Wind Chime Inn. We looked at it and it is a tiny pool), and be right on the beach, this is definitely not the place for you. But, if you are looking for a very intimate hotel experience (we personally like these intimate hotels, as we live in the high-rise building in mid-town, Manhattan), we would recommend this hotel, although next time around we would love to stay at the hotel, that is located right on the beach, where we can hear the waves.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA gem\u201d", "Author": "Debsvlad", "ReviewID": "UR122016850", "Content": "Thank you to my gf who researched and found La Concha!

Excellent idea. Sitting out on the balcony was a joy, whether waking up to the fresh ocean breeze, resting in the hot afternoon, or listening to the coquis (P.R. tree frogs that chirp and chirp and whistle and sing and chirp and chirp...) with a cocktail at night. I believe all the rooms have a balcony, but it was extra nice looking out over the beach and the sea. Everyone at reception was helpful and kind (we ran the gamut, staying 7 nights), whether providing advice or a last-minute rental car. [Speaking of rental cars, go with Target, a P.R. company just across the expressway. They were prompt and competitively priced and easy. Enterprise, with whom we originally made a reservation, failed to show up with our car and then \"lost\" our reservation.] The staff at Niche, the hotel restaurant, were kind and helpful too. As for Niche, it's expensive, but we enjoyed two meals there anyway. The giant jacuzzi was nice too, but more of a gimmick than anything. Free Wi-Fi worked great on my tablet, and the TV options were just fine with lots of English programming. As for the neighborhood, Condado Beach is gorgeous. Swam every morning and afternoon in the rolling, warm surf (a bit seaweedy at times, but ever so refreshing and fun). Tips: for good local eats, go to Kasalta (left a few blocks on McLeary www.kasalta.com), Santurce BBQ (a great little joint on Degetau off McLeary), Tijuana's (great Mexican food in the frou-frou area right on Ashford), or Bebo's for mofongo (but little else: poor service & atmosphere). Mofongo is a must eat while in P.R. Coffee is good and cheap at Cafe del Loto just left on Loaiza, or at Kasalta. The SuperMax grocery store on de Deigo provided us with plenty of water, DonQ Rum, snacks, etc., to keep up happy while in the room. The 53 and 21 buses run down Ashford to Old San Juan (the gem of the city). The fare is 75 cents (bring quarters), board them at the 'parada' stops. Easy and cheap way to get to Old San Juan (taxis are much much too expensive). Note: the 53 and 21 buses stop running at 9pm, but you can still get back on the 1 (? not sure of the number, but ask how to get to the east end of Condado), which takes you just a few blocks from Ashford. Took the ferry from Old San Juan (50 cents) to Contano for the Bacardi Rum tour, which was fun. Can't say enough about how lovely Old San Juan is. Just soak it all in... Other advice? Rented the car from Target for 2 days; went to Caguas for a baseball game (awesome) and El Yunque to hike the rainforest (also awesome, a must do). Driving was typical of driving anywhere, and it was easy to navigate. Parked on Taft in front of the hotel both nights for free. [Technically there's no parking allowed, but everyone parks there anyway. Tip: park on the Acacia side of the street. If the unlikely happens and tickets are handed out, the fine is much lower on that side.] It was a $20 cab ride to and from the airport, but well worth it. There's really no other option, anyway. Don't forget to get Duty Free on your way out of P.R. It doesn't matter that you're still in the United States. What else? Have fun, say hi to the coquis, and say gracias, adios! on your way out.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cClaudio!\u201d", "Author": "Jasanne B", "ReviewID": "UR121048393", "Content": "Although I was happy with the place, it was the people who made our stay at the Acacia enjoyable and memorable. Claudio, the morning front desk manager, was an incredibly friendly, tentative, resourceful staff member who went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. He arranged for me to take a bio bay kayaking tour with a reputable company. The experience was one I'll never forget and I thank him immensely for the suggestion and arrangement. He was informative and kind and took the time to talk to us: we learned a lot about Puerto Rican culture from what he shared with us. (Charlene, Chad, and even the Chef were also very nice and helpful!)(There was, however, one front desk clerk in the morning - European accent - who was very rude, didn't seem to understand my English, and seemed put off by my questions which he answered as simply as he could. He misinformed me regarding how long it took to drive somewhere. He was not hospitable!) Being a boutique hotel Acacia is not an appropriate place for children, a great place for couples and friends; however, the staff was very kid-friendly and accommodating to my three year old and me. Claudio was wonderful with my son: he's naturally good with kids. The restaurant was to posh to eat at with my son, but one evening when we didn't want to go out to eat, they made a gourmet pizza and brought it up to the fourth floor roof deck for us to have dinner. It was perfect! My son had ample space to eat and move around and we didn't have to worry about bothering any nearby couples out for a romantic dinner. We could hear the ocean waves, count the stars, and listen to the \"coqui\" frogs. Because I dislike large cookie-cutter hotel chains, casinos, franchise resturaunts, and loud clubs, this hotel was perfect. It had personality: friendly staff, cool chill-out music, refreshing cucumber/orange water at the front desk, residential location... It wasn't directly on the beach, but one apartment building away from the beach. (Maybe 13 steps from the hotel to the sand?) You can see the beach from the Jacuzzi on the second floor and the roof deck on the fourth floor. The beach is clean, quiet, spacious, peaceful, not crowded... The water, bathwater warm, was a bit rough to swim in. I saw some incredible rainbows. Palm trees with coconuts. Early in the morning you'll see a personal trainer working out 2 or 3 local people. If I had stayed longer, I would have liked to have found out about his fee and tried to sign up: it actually looked like fun and not work. He had some very creative ways of getting people in shape. (There's also a local yoga studio close by.). I have to suggest two local places to eat, walking distance to the hotel that my family and I enjoyed. One was a local place called Cafe Bebos: a clean, family-friendly, restaurant with good, fast service, informative servers and typical puerto-rican food. The second place is a bakery with good coffee called Kasalta. In the morning you'll find all the locals gathered around drinking coffee, eating breakfast, reading the newspaper, and engaged in lively conversation. In the evening this turns into a place were people eat dinner with a bottle of wine. A couple of blocks from the hotel I came across a local shop that makes custom-made bathing suits and bikinis. For $45 dollars I had a custom-made bikini made for me and they did it in one day! I wouldn't have come across a place like this in San Juan or in Isla Verde. A couple of suggestions for the hotel: 1. Bathrobes! 2. If possible, window screens (I would love to open the windows at night without having tropical insects fly in.). 3. Update the website: I didn't know there were fridges in the room and was worried about how I would be able to buy and store milk form my son. 4. Update the phone number on the business cards. 5. Put a couple of chairs and small tables on the roof deck for a place to have breakfast. 6. A tour of the hotel at check-in: I didn't know there was an outdoor shower for rinsing off from the beach until a couple of days into my stay. 7.

I felt the need to review: Upon our arrival here, we were treated soooo rudely by the lady at the front desk. We think it's because when we first arrived we were drenched from the rain forest and in hiking clothes. It's NOT ok. We arrived in the early evening and went to check in., we were treated very rudely by the lady at the front desk who was just plain mean. I was appalled and we almost left right there. Unfortunately I had already paid for my room. She was the most unprofessional person I encountered on my trip to Puerto Rico. She acted as though we werent good enough to be staying there and when I asked where I could park my car she told me they didn't have any parking. Luckily, I had printed out my confirmation email stating I had requested and paid for the parking. She eventually reluctantly 'found' us a spot. When we went over to the sister hotel to park our car, they were expecting us. Our car was the ONLY one there for the next two days. Out of parking huh? If I were her boss and whitnessed that, I would have fired her on the spot (my boyfriend and I are both attorneys in the U.S. and love how she judged us by our gym clothes). She seemed to warm up a little bit after we had showered and changed into clothes for 'going out'. Seems as though she would know better. The next day we were LUCKY enough to have a WONDERFUL host. If it were not for this man (who's name I cannot remember) our stay would have been based on our first impression. We had went to the castillo's that day and ended at pinky's with sammies to go and a bottle of wine. When my boyfriend went to find platic cups he presented us with plastic wine glasses! He was so very nice and let us take them to beach for our dinner and in the hot tub later. He was outstanding! So friendly. The hotel itself: Actually I loved it. The hot tub is very nice, great size, and very peaceful in the morning. you can see the ocean from it while sipping your cucumber water. The beach is literally just down the street, not even a block away. The location was also nice (we had a rental car), it was quick to the busier areas, walk to pinkie's (sooo yummy!) and the rooms were all you need. Small but clean and comfortable.

Brenda's suggestion of a day trip to Vieques to do the Bio-Kayak tour was incredible. She said it was \"the best\" and it was.

Actually, the water temperature is far from being hot, and the water jets are ordinary taps... The only good thing was the free Wi-Fi in the room.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "danxtsupamodel", "Title": "\u201cLoved Acacia inside and out~You have to stay!\u201d", "Author": "danxtsupamodel", "ReviewID": "UR116957192", "Content": "Thanks TripAdvisor & Acacia Staff! My husband and I celebrated our 5 year wedding anniversary @ Acacia on last Friday. We actually just left on Wednesday 8/17/11 and really wanted to stay longer but we will be back with family and friends! So how did I find out about Acacia? I read about how great this hotel was on TripAdvisor and my husband agreed that we should stay so I booked our stay and off we were to San Juan. So the hotel~ 1st Impressions are always lasting! We took a Taxi due to finding out you can take the local bus for 75 cents basically all over the island and that there were a little more than 3 stops within a 5-10min walk from the hotel. So we stepped out of the Taxi right in front of Acacia's huge wooden door and heard wonderul relaxing music as well as the ocean's waves and people playing volleyball on the beach of course. Besides the door we noticed that the beach was right there~I mean you step outside and you see the water,waves, sand ,trees etc! So that of course was a plus in our book! So we are buzzed in because your room key is the key that allows you to open the door to the hotel and we were greeted by Beth! I'm so bad with names but as soon as we opened the door she greeted us with a huge smile and said \"GoodMorning welcome to Acacia!' We were so in awe of the lobby we just looked around and took in the lovely colors,smells, music and of course the HUGE REAL plants they have all over! She let us know that her system was down and that our room would be ready in about 5min. Our flight got in real early and we didn't request an early check in...we just got off the plane and headed right for the hotel. Okay so now we are calm and very relaxed and she say's we have fresh apple,lemon, and melon water if you would like to try some! Oh my goodness~It was AWESOME! Maybe because I was thirsty or something but it was the best! So we drank 2 cups each just standing there it was ICE COLD! Another plus! So now she say's let me give you a tour of our property~my husband and I are like okay sure~she not only takes us to our room but show's us everything about the property, the resturant-which I will come back to, the jacuzzi, the sundeck, the sister property 1 street over at the corner, and of course the beach! My hubby and I felt like were staying with family! So after showing us all over this wonderful place she tells us about the local festivals they were having in Old San Juan and how to get there, local places to eat, what shops were close by to get great gifts...I mean she was so full of energy and information! We got maps from her and she circled everything and even outlined things for us! What a great first impression! So after reading all the reviews on TripAdvisor I asked if Chad was around since so many people raved about how helpful he was~well Chad was having major back issues and was going to be out the entire time we were there :( Hope your better Chad! So with that being said she let us know that she would be there until 10pm and if we needed anything she was just a call away. So our room~Our room # was 204 so we were on the second floor. We had a pefect view of the beach and the jacuzzi! Our bed was a queen and it was quite comfy! We had a flat screen tv and everything we needed. The only thing I had an issue with was our curtain rod was a bit dusty and it didn't close like I wanted it to. You couldn't see in from the balcony but there was still a bit of light just shinning in. My husband had no issues with it so I didn't bother with bringing it up to the front desk or the maid during our stay. Room 204 had no tub....I really didn't care but some other's might. I believe none of the rooms have tub's but don't hold me to that. The shower has this really cool stone back and floor~actually it runs throughout the entire bath room! We loved it up until we came back from the beach and still had some sand on our flip flops and clothing and it would get wet and then be on the floor. Not a huge deal! So let's see the sheets and pillows smelled nice and fresh each day. The room was cleaned by the same lady everyday. I actually think she's the only cleaning lady they have~she was the only one we saw our entire stay and she was very friendly and made sure we always had everything we needed. The Jacuzzi-This thing is AWESOME! It was well kept! Always clean, and hot! My husband and I sat in it daily and they have a small area that you can wash yourself off that's beside the jacuzzi. Keep in mind it's in the open and there are at least 4-5 high rises that are by the hotel so don't be alarmed if you see people staring at you or sitting on there balcony while you are in the jacuzzi. It closes at I believe 9pm but we were told that you can use it as long as you aren't being loud or bothering the other guest. They make this known because there are outside rooms that you have to walk past to get to the jacuzzi and those that are in those rooms can walk right out of there door and they are steps away from the jacuzzi. We had cups of the apple water sitting on the small bench that's located right outside of the jacuzzi and we never say anyone with drinks or food outside that area. There is no pool! We didn't really care because the beach was right there and who needs a pool when there's a beach right outside your door. We were made aware that guest of Acacia can use the pool at WindChimes which is the sister hotel right up the street. You can actually see it when you walk out of Acacia. It's at the corner. The Resturant-Niche It's very nice and small...I would have to say it seats maybe 20 if that. But it's really neat how it's situated in the back area of the hotel! You have to pass through the front lobby to get to the resturant. They are open for breakfast and dinner. And our waiter-forgot his name was really nice. He had been working there for 4 months and we asked him the basic's since we were the only guest in the resturant at the time-what are some good places to go, what's great to eat at the resturant, where's good shopping etc. He was very nice and helpful. Now, the resturant is not CHEAP! This resturant is about $$$ if you ask me. My husband and I wanted breakfast and didn't want to walk anywhere or take a taxi so we dined at Niche and had the blueberry pancakes and sausage. We paid $14 for breakfast for 1. He recieved 3 nice size pancakes and about 3 sausage links. I thought that was sorta expensive but we shared it and went back to our room. Pancakes had real blueberries in them...they were great! And the sausage links were great as well. Another bonus! Lobby/Reception Area- The owner's have 3 other properties from what I was told. so they switch there employee's around to different properties. The 3 people that were of help to us were Beth,Fred & and I have no idea what the guy's name is but he reminded me of Micheal McDonald. All were very nice and helped with whatever we needed whether is was a Taxi or directions or suggestions. The lobby was always clean and smelled exceptional. There was always jazz or carribean music playing and Ice cold melon & lemon water wating for guests. They also let us know that the weather changes alot but they of course are use to it so it could be sunny and then they have a rain spurt here and there. They had umbrellas for there guest to borrow. They also had beach towels at the front desk. And if you wanted they had snacks and bottle service of DonQ liquors available for I believe $10. All of this was convient if you didn't want to shop outside of the hotel for your alcohol needs. Taxi Service- Lighting fast...The Micheal McDonald looking guy (I'm so sorry I don't remember his name) called us a Taxi. We got our bags and came down stairs and a Taxi was right there! In front of the hotel waiting for us! The Taxi driver's are very nice and accomodating. They have zones so there's no thrown out there price. They have no meters they have Zones 1-4. They have the Zones right on there windows so you can clearly see what the price is before you get into the Taxi. We tipped $2 per bag but they aren't hounding you for tips or anything they are gracious and very nice. So why not rent a car? We didn't rent a car and wouldn't because of the driving conditions. We saw people driving on the side of the road, running through red lights and people double parking there cars and walking off. We chose to just walk and ride the bus. If you ride the bus keep in mind that they just take breaks when they choose and you could be waiting for an hour on a bus. Also, remember you must have exact change if you want to ride the bus. We encountered a driver that wouldn't let this lady ride because she didn't have the exact change. We also asked the driver's where they were going before getting on the bus. Some of the signs were covered due to grafitti and signs and we wanted to make sure we were going the right way. Shopping/Tourist Area Ashford Ave- It's basically within 10min of the hotel. It's the hot spot for tourist. They have bars, clubs, boutiques, resturants, ice cream and of course the Luxury Retail Shops~LV,Gucci, Cartier,Christobal and more. There's a HUGE police presence and you will def feel safe! But once you travel further down Ashford to where the private homes are the Police presence is very minimal. My husband and I felt safe and had no issues walking around the area day or night. We basically always made it back to the hotel by 10pm or 11pm and where fine. Misc. Stuff So the hotel is non smoking but they do have a smoking area that's on the back of the hotel that's very nice. There's bar top tables that are located along a wall and there's lights and candles that are light to keep the bugs away. The ice machine along with the door that leads out of the hotel to the beach are along the back of the hotel as well. You have to use your key to get in and out of these doors. Your room key allows you to open and these doors. There are cameras at both the front and back doors and speaker systems as well. The beach- It's right there! I mean 2min if that from the hotel. It's nice, filled with vendors that are selling fruit and local food. We didn't encounter anyone pushy or that we thought was of any harm. I think I covered everything I could think of...don't take my word for it~try it for yourself Enjoy!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "Doe22us", "ReviewID": "UR116922103", "Content": "We stayed at Acacia from the 11th-15th and it was fantastic.

I have to say, I didn't read any reviews. I needed a hotel quick because I had an impromptu visit to San Juan. So, I booked the Wind-Chime from my phone the morning of my arrival from Vieques ( where I was vacationing from DC ). I had no idea what to expect, but the price was great and I hate big resort hotels that bubble you away from the real deal. I only planned to stay a couple of days to visit friends stopping via cruise and to see Old San Juan. The Wind-Chime is charmingly beautiful and Lourdes is a saint, just what I was looking for. She informed me of the restaurant at their sister hotel, Acacia Boutique Hotel, in case I needed a great meal. The next early-mid afternoon, I wander over to Acacia to check out the grub. I love the beautiful spanish architecture and that the beach is within spitting distance. The lobby speaks for itself, just right, they've thought of everything (I want that scent for my pad you guys!), and I meet Brenda and Chad. Professional and laid back, attentive and not pushy ( and hotties to boot...), I am treated with respect and courtesy. I am too early for the dinner run, so Chad makes a few recommendations, the first being \"Miro\" (Go!!). It's just a short walk to downtown Condado. On my way out, I wonder if I can change hotels. The process is a snap and Chad gives me a tour of the property. The Buddha is cool and the hot-tub is a show-stopper (wow!). I'm given a room on the third floor that is exceptionally clean and fresh and it has a wrap around balcony facing the ocean. The bed is comfy and I sleep like the dead. Long story short, I spent a week at Acacia, far longer than the couple of days I had planned. Due to my escapades, I regretfully never made it to eat at Niche, the hotels famed intimate restaurant. I will when I come back! The food smelled amazing! I did, however, get to experience their signature Mojito there. I love mojito's and you have to go to Cuba to get one better. The bartender was super friendly and we shared good conversation with the other hotel guests. I did do the hot-tub, thank God, and you can do laps in it! Thank you to Chad and Brenda for helping to make my first time visit to San Juan so memorable. It was the most fun and the best experience I have had in a long time.

It has one of the best locations (super close to the beach, walking distance to a great part of town, all nestled in a very safe, residential area) and is like stepping into a fantastically preserved little Spanish villa. The rooms were simple: small, but just enough for a trip where you should be spending a majority of your day at the beach or in Old San Juan, anyway. They could use a little bit of sprucing up (we had a couple holes in the curtains and the bedspread; walls needed some touching up, etc), but most importantly, it was clean. Hot tub was great, and the pool at the sister resort, At Wind Chimes, was nice, too. It was literally a block away, and again: small, but a good size for a few people. Niche, the hotel restaurant, seemed to be a bit overpriced (especially for Puerto Rico), so we only ate there for breakfast. The food was delicious, though, and all prepared fresh and right in front of you. The only downside might be the fact that having someone at the front desk is somewhat unreliable. We were told someone would be there until midnight, and at 11PM, there was no one there. Then, when it came time to checkout at 8AM, there was still no one there.

I work in PR, a very customer-service based business and I don't understand how people don't get it. Although we stayed at the Renaissance, Chad was our concierage.

The hotel is conveniently located near beaches, restaurants, bars, casinos, and shopping. If you desire a calm beach atmosphere simply walk half a block from the hotel. If a beach party complete with locals dancing to reggaeton is more your speed, you can walk a couple of blocks east. Additionally, a restaurant row with a diversity of restaurants to satisfy any taste are within walking distance.

Our room was great, with a comfortable bed and nice sized bathroom, and plenty of space to store our clothes and things. The jacuzzi is GIGANTIC and the perfect temperature, with plenty of little nooks for couples to have privacy--it was honestly about the same size as the swimming pool at Windchimes!

The hotel is within walking distance of a lot of great restaurants in Condado and Ocean Park - although be aware that the area is fairly touristy and therefore a lot of the restaurants and bars can be a little bit pricey. Make sure to take advantage of the happy hour specials! If you are looking for a place to party you have to check out La Placita.

I spent my first five days in Old San Juan, I tried out a few hotels there. After all the partying and sight seeing was done, I was ready for a nice place to relax. When I first arrived the front door was locked and there was a note telling me to go to another hotel to check in. It was about half a block away. This was a little frustrating because it was pretty warm out and I had all my luggage with me. When I checked in there was a very nice lady at the desk. Despite her printer not working properly, check in was pretty quick. The only reason I mention that is because once I walked into the lobby of the Acacia I noticed all brand new state of the art equipment at the desk making me wonder why they don't just bring that over to the Wind Chimes Hotel check in, nobody uses it in Acacia. Those were all the troubles I had there. Once you enter the lobby, you are blown away by beautiful paintings on the all and foliage everywhere. I went up the wrong stairs at first (no elevator) but was very impressed with the architecture and decor. I finally found my room and it looked better than the photos on the website. I turned on the A/C right away because it was a little warm, then opened the French doors to the balcony. I had a fantastic view of the bluest white sand beach in the world. The balcony was massive and wrapped around my entire room. The bathroom was small but well done. The first thing I did was go to the beach. It had to have been the most beautiful beach I have ever seen. No exaggeration. Then when I returned I headed to the pool. It was very different from anything I had ever seen so I had to try it out. The first thing I noticed was how perfect the water was. Not so cold that it shocks you once you touch it, but not warm either, it was perfect. I spent about an hour basking in the sun and listening to the waves crash on the beach. It was the perfect way to relax. When I returned to my room I took a shower. The water pressure was right on and the shower was pretty nice as well. I was exhausted from partying the night before so I opened the balcony doors, layed on the bed and passed out immediately. The warm air and cool a/c made for a great combination of temperatures followed by the crashing waves. I have not slept that soundly in years. Both nights I stayed there were just as pleasing and tranquil. It was a perfect way to end a great stay in Puerto Rico.

When we got there, the AC was off and it was so hot!! Our view was also of a white stucco wall about 2 feet from our window. The room was miniscule. There was not even a clock to be found. The TV was small and the remote did not even work. The phone in the room didn't even have any extension numbers on it. AS I began to reluctantly unpack our things, my husband realized that the bed in our room was not King, a big gap down the middle of the bed showed that it was two double beds pulled together and draped with a king sized comforter!!!! We immediately called tracelocity. We were only there for a weekend, so we didn't want to waste time in the junky hotel so we decided to head to get some food and sit on the beach. I spent over and hour on the phone with travelocity because the hotel kept putting them on hold. The hotel said that they had no more king rooms available so that is why we got put in a fake king. I refused to cave in, so finally they told travelocity they would move us to a queen bed for that night and a deluxe king the next night. We agreed and told them we would be there within the next two hours to switch rooms. When we got there, the woman at the front desk was different than the one who checked us in. She was NASTY!!! I told her we were there to switch our room, and she tells me that the room we were in was considered a king so we were not getting another room.

The manager I believe then got involved and they convinced us to look at their Queen beds. we had already wasted so much time and we were only there for two days that we decided to stay.

Comfortable bed, GREAT AC unit which kept the room very cool (and it was very humid during our stay). No room clock, large dresser and two end tables to store you items from home.

Bar soap, shampoo, plastic cups and hairdryer all were provided. Clean towels supplied daily. Balcony: Wonderful and large. We were on the corner so we had a front and side balcony with one plastic chair. Nice to relax and read a book for awhile when your partner is getting ready inside the room. Location: Perfect for us. We had no rental car so we either walked or used taxis. The taxi ride far (with tip) was about $20 to and from the hotel. We also took a taxi into San Juan one day and then took the public bus (C53) back from San Juan to our hotel.

I am happy to report I got both. The front of the house staff Claudio and Palmerra were excellent. Both very professional, genuine and very nice people. The hearts of the people of San Juan are large and that is what makes it such a great place to visit. I like smaller intimate places because you actually get to know the staff first hand and the owner is a lucky man to have these two steering his ship. But wait there's more...the food is fabulous... however you need to cut through the hype and get to the real wonderful Puerto Rican and Caribbean cuisine..it's a family oriented culture and food matters. I am very judgmental when it comes to my food...I want the place clean, I want good service, I want to feel the owner gets what he is doing and wants to deliver consistently. My three hands down favorites were Kasalta's for breakfast every morning one of the local hangouts (they have lunch, dinner and take out as well)...Kasalta's is a gem. Picayo at the art museum is on the fine dining side and is also fabulous...the front of the house Maitre D', Martin is a gifted man when it comes to hospitality and on my second visit Martin introduced us to Chef Wilo Benet who is a force in the cuisine of his country. An engaging chef who cares about delivering fine high end food. Metropol another local down home Puerto Rican eatery was another treasure. The waiter Raffie took a one look at me and told me I had to try the roast pork (I guess he knows his Boston Irish tourist palettes), the engaging staff immediately served up some amazing bread, and Raffi kept the house wine from Spain coming...Raffi brought out a bowl of chopped garlic marinated in olive oil as a sauce for the pig and I was in heaven! A few other mentionable's were Miro, Bebo and the Tapas bar (forget the name) next to Dragon Flies in old San Juan...on the down side Pasteria near the hotel was a bust lots of staff but no service, no one cleaning the tables or cleaning the place...so the floor was strewn with napkins and food. No excuse for that in my opinion... it starts at the top and the owner doesn't get the food service business. I was also disappointed in BuddaThai. El San Juan on Friday and Saturday nites is fun. I also suggest getting up early one morning grabbing a few bottles of water and walking to Old San Juan..its a good hike (5 or so miles)...but will give you a great idea of the area and what is all about.

There was only one air-conditioner in my room, but my friend's room was more spacious than mine, so we pulled straws. The front desk attendant, Felix, really should be running this hotel, as he manages every thing about it with precision. Not only did he make sure that we got the room we requested (there was some initial confusion about availability), but he provided us with more information about the island and its activities than any manual or guide could have. He gave precise driving directions, exact names of persons who ran businesses three towns away (Pinones) and even told us about various points of interests to our liking. Parking can be difficult if you're renting a car, but it's not impossible. The hotel offers a guaranteed parking spot for a fee ($10 a day), but we were able to find space on the street. Many of the excursions that you'll want to do can be set up by the hotel, if you ask. They did not attempt to sell us on anything, merely suggested companies when we inquired. Through them, we were able to rent a car and double-check pricing for our Biolumiscent Bay tour (doing this resulted in a drop in our price, so we were pleased). GAY TRAVELLERS will be delighted with Acacia's location in the Condado area (akin to Chelsea in NYC, Castro Area in San Fran, and Chueca in Madrid. . .all C's. . .coincidence?). To top it off, the Acacia is walking distance from the \"gay beach\" off of Vendig Street, near the Atlantic Hotel. There is a nearby Internet Cafe and even a place to buy stylish swimsuits (Monsieur).The walk to various clubs is a bit longer, but enjoyable. There are SEVERAL places to eat in all price ranges. Many have mentioned Patisserie (3 stars), Pamela's (4 stars), Bebo's (3 stars). Toiletries can be bought at either of the two nearby Walgreens (one of which is 25 hours) on Ashford Street, and a nearby supermarket (Diego and Loiza) is open 24 hours. They even sell liquor. Overally, this hotel was wonderful. If I were to complain, I would ask the Acacia to increase the temperature on the 30-foot hot-tub (it was lukewarm), or would frown on the fact that there is no attendant at the front desk after 11:00pm (the attendant is stationed at the sister hotel, Wind Chimes Inn, about 100 feet up the block). Fastidious travellers will not like the fact that this small hotel doesn't really have room service or food options available, but my friend and I, both 25, are independent and don't need anyone to hold our hand.

The huge hot tub on the 2nd floor was impressive, but the water was not hot at all and the waterfalls were not working.

The airlines forced us to arrive roughly 12 hours late, but a quick phone call to Felix took care of things for us. He even told me not to let our seemingly clueless cabbie take advantage of me, telling me that standard cab fare from the airport should be $15-$20. Upon arrival at 10:55pm, our hearts sunk just a little bit. The lobby was very dark, oddly decorated, with a few strange characters hanging around it. Some ominous music in the background gave the situation the feel of a bad 1970s scam job from some movie. After getting checked in and settled (room 205), as expected, the room was small with no closet. There was no plasma TV, only a small tube TV. The room was exceptionally clean, and our favorite feature was the very nice oversized shower. Room 205 was well away from the hot tub area, so noise was never a problem. We saw very few other patrons throughout the rest of our stay. As for the hot tub, it is easily the crown jewel of the inn. It's a little convoluted to get to from our section of rooms, but once we got there, it was worth the search. Most of the time there was only one other couple in the 30' tub. My wife and I even got to enjoy it by ourselves for a solid hour on a wonderful starry night. (NOTE: The jet controls are located right over the sign. We couldn't find them until another couple helped us.) The hotel location is well away from the tourist part of town, which is both good and bad. When you walk away from the strip, you get to experience the real San Juan, which is a little dirtier than the strip. Plenty of bashed up cars line the streets, as does a fair amount of garbage. Several of the other establishments were graffiti'ed up, and had razor wire protecting their fences, which is never a good sign. Despite all of these things, we were never in the presence of any threatening people at all. As for the beach itself, it is steps away from the main entrance, heavily lined with palm trees, as most photos will indicate. The beach was very peaceful with very few people on it. The surf was rough and the sand very peculiar. The grains were large, and with every step you sank 2-6\" into the sand, even very close to the shore. The staff was polite and courteous, and even recommended a nice seafood restaurant for our final day on the island. My only complaint about the front desk is that they close from 11pm-6am, so if you need to check out in the middle of the night, you have to walk a block down the street to do so at the At Wind Chimes sister hotel. (I only make this complaint because we had to do this in the rain at 4:30am to make our 7:00am flight.) Despite the odd start, it was a good stay, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to deviate from the land of tourist traps and typical sterile chain resorts.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "gilbert,az", "Title": "\u201cWonderful\u201d", "Author": "eeskinner", "ReviewID": "UR16687367", "Content": "My bf and I went to Acacia after we took the southern caribbean cruise and we LOVED it!!

Over the last two years, I've stayed at pretty much every single guesthouse in Ocean Park and Condado, but this was my first time staying at the Acacia (Numero Uno was booked, and so was At Wind Chimes Inn - they in turn referred me to the Acacia). Overall, the rooms and common areas at the Acacia are by far the nicest. The owners clearly take great pride in their property, and this is evident in the general upkeep and cleanliness of the Inn, and the friendliness of the staff. The rooms are comfortable, with nice touches such as plasma TVs, the bathrooms are large and well-appointed, and the proximity to the beach is second only to Numero Uno. In terms of price/quality, I'd be hard-pressed to come up with better value. What could have been a great stay, however, was ruined by the incessant noise that came every single night from the spa/pool area. Part of the problem is that the spa, while officially closed after 11:00pm, is accessible at all hours of the day and night. One night, I was awoken at 4:30am by a group of drunken guests who kept partying in the hot tub until 6:00am. Part of the problem is also because the Inn is not staffed after 11:00pm, so there is no one on site to keep things calm. Calls to the front desk of At Wind Chimes Inn, the sister property down the street, resulted in sympahetic apologies, but nothing more was done about it. The biggest problem, however, seems to be that the Acacia hasn't quite figured out what it wants to be. By tolerating loud drunken behavior (and since I'm not the first reviewer to write about it, it points to the fact that it's an ongoing issue), management is implicitly condoning it. If they want to be a \"party-type\" hotel and rent rooms to large groups, so be it. That said, they can't be all things to all people, and they need to realize that this choice comes at the expense of guests who like me, are just looking to relax in peace and quiet.

I hesitate raving about the Acacia for fear Staters will inundate the place, expecting Wifi, slick tv's throughout and a concierge who kisses your Chihuahua in three different languages. But I owe a debt to Trip Advisor for the reviews I had read about both this hotel and its sister hotel and want to thank the entire staff of these inns for their warmth. I too had booked a room in At Wind Chimes, Acacia's sister hotel a half-block away. Instead, I was given a room at the Acacia. Wind Chimes would have been fine and, in fact, I spent a good amount of time in their tropical bar and the pool (small but wonderful atmosphere). I didn't see any of Wind Chimes's rooms but the rest of the hotel was wonderful. Like Acacia, there were plenty of little places to escape with a book or with someone else. Everyone on the staff was extremely welcoming. Allen and Mario at the Wind Chimes outdoor bar were beyond wonderful, attentive without being obsequious and just plain a lot of fun to hang around. And so was the staff at Acacia: Felix and the great women behind the desk as well as the terrific waitress at Niche, the hotel restaurant, were as accommodating as could be. The restaurant, as we say in Boston, was wicked awesome. It's so hard to describe the ambience but think the coolest boutique hotel restaurant, with granite walls and mood lighting from floor (actually under the floor) to ceiling. The ceviche was tremendous beyond words. But the place is beautifully small so do reserve a table; it probably seats less than 25 people, including the bar. Actually, one of the best meals I had in the Condado was at a local, family restaurant about 3 1/2 blocks away from the ocean, a left off of Taft Street and a few doors on the other side of the Esso. It doesn't sound glamourous and it's not, but its bright local color and fresh fish are not to be missed. Sorry, the name escapes me. Calling the Acacia's hot tub a tub is like calling the Atlantic Ocean a pond. It's as big as the pool at Wind Chimes, more like a giant, meandering spa. Check out the photos someone else has included in their review on this site. At night the \"tub\" glistens and you float into heaven, buoyed by the salt water and tranquilizing minerals. My room was fanatastic. I didn't go to Puerto Rico to watch tv, play with my Blackerry or demand that people treat me like an entitled American. And I don't mind not hanging my clothes up for a week. If you miss a closet, you're packing too many clothes. It's very hot in PR. The sea breeze betrays a scorching sun. I lay in the shade under a palm tree at the end of Taft street for about 45 minutes and got a hell of a burn. Keep the summer sweaters in your closet at home; you'd feel overdressed in the Condado. When I was there the surf was especially high and pretty violent. I'm a strong swimmer and I had a tough time with the undertow. The locals respect the beach in this part of the island and there's a reason very few people go in the ocean here, and never stray out too far. It's just too dangerous, definitely not a place for children. But the sound of that surf, frenzied by the night winds, with palm tress licking at the moon, is incredibly seductive--nature's tango. I could go on and on. This is just my kind of place, but I concede it is not for everyone. The Acacia is still undergoing renovations and you cannot make or receive long distance calls in your room, my room anyway. If you're accustomed to the conveniences of the States and like the predictability of Starbucks, TGI Fridays and Marriot, if you are intolerant of anyone that doesn't speak American, you'll find a reason to be inconvenienced.

We both loved the hotel and the location as well as the very friendly and helpful staff. We found the hotel very clean and well kept and our accomodations the same. Our room, although a little small, was perfect for what we needed. Be aware that there no closets to hang clothes. There was a rack attached to the wall where you could hang individual items but something like a garment bag would have probably torn it off the wall. Additionally there is no elevator so if that's an issue I would request a ground floor room. Our room number was 301 and was a corner queen room with a wrap around balcony.

Every restaurant that he suggested to us was spot on. Thank-you Felix! We loved the location of Acacia Seaside Inn as it is located on the border between Condado and Ocean Park. For the most part we loved exploring the Ocean Park neighborhood because it gave us an idea of what it's like to actually live in San Juan rather than just vacation there. There were many charming local restaurants and shops in the area. I would caution folks that do not come from urban areas or find poverty distateful that some of the streets in the area might not be their cup of tea. Also if you do not like to walk much you might be better served in a different part of San Juan.

We did not try the new restaurant, but it smelled great. Kudos to the bartenders at the boat bar. They know how to make drinks. We didn't rent a car, so no problem for parking for us. We walked a lot, took the bus or a tour. We thought about renting a car, but after one day in traffic we decided to let the tour guides to the driving. The only down side (for my husband, not me) having to wait for the Boat bar to open in the morning to get coffee. I don't drink coffee, so I don't care. You do have to walk to get food, unless you go to the Boat bar or the on site restaurant, but we love to walk so it wasn't a problem for us.

A few problems dropped it down for us, but if there were a 3.5 rating, that is probably closer to what we found. Very cute place overall, but the owners seem to have stopped work on it before it was really done. If it is all in the details, (especially at over $200 a night) then they have a way to go. First the good, which many have mentioned. Good location, clean well appointed place. The staff was very freindly overall, but did not respond to problems with anything other than a blank stare. What were the problems? 1. No place on premise to get coffee or sodas at anytime of the day or night. Yes, it is only a block to their sister place, but a pot of coffee for the guests would have made mornings much nicer. This would not cost them much, but the feeling was that anything that held down profit from their sister hotels bar and food shack was not going to happen. A walk to the nearest store for a cup of coffe or pastry was close to a mile. 2. The giant plasma screen TV's on the wall in the rooms are not in HD, so you have a giant, lousy picture. Also, there are no guides to the channels in the rooms, and our TV had over 200 choices, (many of them blank) so finding anything to watch was a major chore. When I suggested to the desk that someone might want to type up a guide for the rooms, I was told that they had only been open about six months, and they did not have the time. Sorry, but this could be done by the overnight person at the desk in a few moments if they cared. 3. Balconies with no usable furniture. We paid extra for a room with a balcony, only to find that wihout a small table and chairs, it really was pointless. You can't sit on the ground. Again, a suggestion that they might want to consider putting these on the patios was met with a stare. 4. Suspected kickbacks to the staff from service places. Everytime we suggested we were going to eat somewhere the front dest jumped all over it to get us a \"Must have\" reservation only for us to find we were one of only a handfull of tables in the place. Also had them book us a car, and when we went to pick it up, the rate was $10 higher per day for us than the customers in line in front of us who just wandered in. No explaination was given. 5. Parking for the hotel. A car is really a must if you want to see any of the island, but parking is terrible. When we rented the car, the front desk person said we would always be able to find a spot within a block or so. NOT. Sometimes we would have been better off walking the mile to the main drag rather than fight the parking situation. So, this place could be a solid 5 stars with management that wanted to make the details a high priority. We did not dislike the place, but kept shaking our heads at how simple it would be to make it really special. Hope they do so.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cA Little Gem!\u201d", "Author": "koptravel", "ReviewID": "UR12467554", "Content": "After researching hotels in the San Juan area on-line, we took a chance on Acacia since it was newly renovated, the price was reasonable and it was near the beach. We were more than pleasantly surprised with the welcoming and extremely helpful staff, comfortable room, and giant jacuzzi! With our two children ages 4 and 7, we spent three nights as a part of a 6 day vacation and enjoyed every minute of our stay. The jacuzzi was the perfect temperature and our kids could swim around while we relaxed. We could walk to the beach (less than two minutes from the room) and a short walk to a park for the kids to play and 10 minute walk to restaurants. We ate a few meals at the bar/restaurant down the block at Wind Chimes (you are given access since they are sister hotels) and we loved the kitchy semi-outdoor atmosphere and the food and drinks were great. Beware that what is on the menu is not always available and the wait can be a few extra minutes but it's worth it. If you order your Mojito Puerto Rican style, you only need to order one! Condado Beach is not the prettiest beach or the nicest beach for young children as the waves are large and there were many groups of young people on spring break, but we were able to find some quiet areas to catch some sun and make sand castles. Definitely take a trip for an afternoon at Luquillo Beach, the water is warm and clear, waves small, great for swimming, and there is a market of local cuisine, most of the people do not speak english but it is a great chance to experience the real culture. When we get back to Puerto Rico someday we will definitely stay at the Acacia again!

The hotel has a great big hot tub (probably 30 feet) that faces the ocean that was wonderful to relax in after a hard day at the beach! The location is also great. Half a block to the beach and a short walk to some nice neighborhood shops and restaurants. It is also only a 10-15 minute walk to all the shops and restaurants of Condado on Ashford street.

However I was not on business I was having a vacation and found the room great. There also isn't an elevator, but I don't know why you would be traveling with luggage you can't carry. The beach is one building away from the hotel and one block away from the wind chimes. I was only once bugged about a tour( which I expected). We were on the third floor and showered in the morning at the same time as everyone else and had no heat problems. The shower head was even adjustable so you could change the pressure to whatever you wanted. We walked to the Marriott casino for an evening of fun, it was about a 10 minute walk. Also we ate at the best restaurant next to the Radisson called Zabo the food was just top notch!

Just a note here about finding your way around the island - you can't. Don't rely on maps, don't rely on directions from locals, don't count on street names. You can, however, rely on Fillipe. He can not only give you accurate street directions, he can get you to the best meal you've ever had or help you find computer communication centers at all hours of the day and night. Fillipe was an instant friend. We would not venture back on the island without consulting him first. The Acacia was much closer to the beach than we expected, from our balcony, room six, I had a view of the ocean - it is a short half block walk to the beach - beautiful. Parking is a slight problem, you are in a neighborhood, a lovely neightborhood. This is nothing like the hotel strip in Isla Verde. You find yourself close to many restaurants and Starbucks is just around the corner. Window shopping was relaxing and a must, it made for a long enjoyable stroll. This area seems safe and I was very comfortable walking here - as were other tourists/locals after dark. Our room was very comfortable and pretty, I loved the bathroom tile - shower only. This place feels like an historic building and it might be although it also feels fresh and new at the same time. The new outdoor hot tub is gorgeous.
