The deluxe king room we had was decorated beautifully. Extremely comfortable bed dressed with perfectly smooth linens. Huge movable flat screen tv. Curtains that open and close by remote control (love that). Heated floors in the enormous decadent bathroom. TV in the bathroom mirror! Beautiful wine glasses,champagne glasses, water glasses, coffee mugs. Cuisinart coffee maker, mini fridge. Enormous closet area. Nightly turn down service. Sigh. I wish I lived here. Better than home, unfortunately. The service in this hotel is first class. Adam, at the front desk, checked us in and was the epitome of class. The concierge was also great. Other hotels could and should take notes from the service that this hotel offers. The only downfall was the restaurant One that is located in the lobby of the hotel. Pretentious and terrible service from some 20 something server dude with overpriced and mediocre food. A better bet within walking distance is to head to Spuntini's Restaurant on Avenue Rd for an amazing meal that wont break the bank.

Upon Arrival the staff were great and took our bags up to the room. We were then taken up to the room and given a tour of the features which I found a little pretentious as all obvious. The deluxe room was spacious and the bathroom was great. I found the room to be very similar to Aria in Las Vegas (same space and very similar decor) most modern hotels now are of this standard. The \"One\" restaurant was closed for renovation and we were made aware of this two weeks before arrival. However, after the first night we had a piece of paper under our door informing us the pool was closed until the 11th Jan and was also being renovated. Poor. We chose this hotel over Le Germain for the extra benefit of the pool, so this was disappointing. I spoke to the reception about \"alternative arrangements\" which the letter quoted to see what they were? I don't think there was any other \"alternative arrangements\" as I had to suggest perhaps they had an arrangement with another hotel to use their pool? The reception called back and had arranged for us to use the Four Seasons pool which I think they should of had in place before someone asked. The hotel WIFI was also poor and regularly dropped out and one morning was not working at all. I was told it simply was not working and its being looked into after an hour later we had to go across the road to Starbucks to log on. Upon checkout we were greeted with the additions of $15 a day for \"local calls\" which we made none and internet charges. After pointing out we had made no local calls and the WIFI was poor they did take that off the bill. At no point was there any mention of the charge for WIFI and considering you do not have to put your room number in to connect Its an additional standard charge. Five star hotels should be building the norm such as WIFI into the price of all rooms as is a basic requirement. Having stayed at other 5 star premium hotels this one just doesn't match up. Its more a four star and on that basis would in hindsight choose Le Germain hands down.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHANDS DOWN BEST HOTEL IN CANADA\u201d", "Author": "Adam P", "ReviewID": "UR122572282", "Content": "I Would say I spend 40-50 days per year in hotels, not often do I have the pleasure of staying in hotels like The Hazelton.

The room and bathroom are both very luxurious. This is a totally different 5 star experience than other 5 star hotels I've stayed at around the world. It will surpass your expectations. Anything you need they have and if they dont, they will run and get it for you. To give you 2 examples, we asked for note cards (it was picked up and delivered from a local stationary store right away). I asked for a pomegranate martini, they didnt have the juice so they sent somebody to a store to pick up the juice for me and apologized for the slight wait....now I found this out after or I would have just ordered another drink. The point is they simply don't say no to you. They don't make excuses for anything. I asked for a dress to be steamed, they realized through transportation it may not be as perfect. After steaming it and sending it back they called and offered to send somebody upstairs with a steamer to steam the bottom after I put it on and make sure it was perfect. We did order room service one night and one breakfast, they were both great. We had a driver at our service our entire stay. The bathroom floors are even heated so you don't step on cold marble. I had a pedicure done at the spa and it was perfect. Their service is absolutely unparalleled. It is something out of this world. The location is perfect (right in Yorkville). They had a bottle of champagne and rose petals in the bath tub waiting for us. It impressed me as they had not done one of those tacky dove and heart displays that I find disgusting. It was minimal and tasteful. One small complaint I have is the sleep quality. My bedroom window opened on top of the restaurant One. I'm from Toronto so I know how busy it gets there on a friday night. The issue was I don't think the windows are very much sound proof. I could hear conversations clearly, It was as if they were in my bedroom. It was difficult to fall asleep (I did not complain about it however).

You feel like its your own private retreat. My last experience at the Hazelton I asked the manager if they could see if they can look into upgrading my floor tickets to the Prince concert. Well they arranged for me to sit in the VIP box with table service 15 feet away from from Prince and then to top it off i was one of 12 twelve people that got called up on stage to dance with him!

Based on reviews and location I chose, knowing nothing of the city, The Hazelton Hotel in Yorkville district. First impression on arrival, nice modern hotel. Friendly doormen and receives the check. A very lively area, just such an excellent location. But again it was what a coincidence. On to the room and that was also determined not to. Had taken a Deluxe King Room. The hotel bar is a meeting place for many local and non local people, I feel. But a cozy bar. Outside, in good weather you can eat on the terrace. I think the ladies or gentleman to take your reservation and bring to the table, both at breakfast and dinner a bit on the arrogant side. Especially for hotel guests. I think that should have an edge on the people who like \"seen\" to be on the terrace. Anyway. Eating well is a little on the expensive, and only a la carte breakfast. The room is divine, I've never slept between sheets such as in this lovely hotel, really great class! Bed itself also delicious! TV fine, and the bathroom even once hell okay. Floor heating in winter, can not be better. Overall a very great comfort!. I also wanted a trip to Niagara Falls. And volunteered at the concierge, it was aided by Dean, super man. He gave you the feeling of what you will about the things you will do, with the appropriate tip, arranged car and other things for me. Really perfect and without arrogance. Upon returning sincerely ask how the region was. That's about as good as you do in the far abroad! In short it was a joy to be here. And not only here Toronto was more than fun, nice people, feel safe, and plenty to see and do.

Good for people watching, but crowds everywhere. My first choice would have been a large 5star hotel, preferably the one around the corner, but they were all booked and we were lucky to get rooms here. Check-in took a while as the clerk was in training (I assume) She was quite chipper and friendly, which is a nice after a fairly uncomfortable flight and awful weather. The room I booked wasn't a standard as there were none left - so it was huge. Large dressing area with mirrors and closet space, but I wish the lighting could have been better. Huge bathroom with tub and separate stand shower. Good lighting in here and lit makeup mirror too. Plenty of soft towels and great smelling toiletries. Here are the negatives ... My colleagues were mostly also pleased with their rooms as well but we all had the same complaints of too much outside noise. I dont know if the windows are thin or if everyone was feeling extra festive because of TIFF, but being awoken by loud house music and people yelling at 3am arent how I want to spend the wee hours of a Tuesday. The elevators require you to swipe your keycard in order to use them. Good safety measure. But this was a bit of a hassle considering me and my colleagues were placed on different floors. So instead we had to use the staircase instead... Kind of defeats the safety measure of making the elevators accessible only by keycard if you can just use the stairs. We tried to stop in the restaurant for a late drink and maybe dessert. When we asked the hostess if they had space for us, she simply said no, without even looking at us. Not even asking if we wanted to wait, or if we wanted to put our names down ... Nothing. I said aloud \"well, that's a shame\" and she glared at me. What a sweetheart.

Their restaurant and room service is a culinary delight. And their location is fantastic. So close to many stores, other restaurants, musea, movie theatres.

Four Seasons, Fairmont, Pantages, Ritz Carlton, Windsor Arms (just to name a few) however the Hazelton Hotel is by far the best in its class! My wife and I checked in on Sunday July 17, 2011 and I can say with all certainty that it was the best experience either of us had ever had in a hotel. From the moment we pulled up to the Valet to the moment of our departure we had nothing but positive comments. The lad working Valet was very pleasant and professional. I was insistent on carrying my own luggage however every staff member we came across offered to handle it for me. At check in we were greeted by \"Niki\" who was extremely friendly and helpful pointing out all of the amenities that the hotel had to offer as well as providing my pregnant wife with a cool bottle of water and assisting us to the elevators. We were situated in suite 409 (a lovely room which we will request again next time). The room was very well spaced with a great dressing area as well as a spacious office area. The room was elaborate and had the feeling of \"grandeur\". Both my wife and I simply fell in love with the bathroom. The soaker tub was exquisite and came in very handy when my wife wanted a moment to relax. The linens in the room, were as my wife put it \"like sleeping on a cloud\". The bed itself was a dream and very relaxing, so much so that we both slept in the following morning. During our stay my wife called front desk and requested the use of an iron. The iron and board were brought up within minute and were set up for our use, again the staff that brought up the items was very friendly and pleasant. In the evening we decided to dine at One Restaurant being that my wife had never been before. Again, the staff greeting us as the entrance were very friendly and helpful. Our waitress was very professional and assisted with all our inquiries. The food was much like everything else, exquisite! We checked out the following day and it was smooth sailing. When our vehicle was brought up they Valet placed two bottles of water in it, which was a lovely touch to an already amazing experience. The only unfortunate thing is that we couldn't stay longer!

I mean this is suppose to be a great hotel and I was told by the reservationist that I resereved a great room for $498. Well i go to my room escorted by a bell-hop.

Da Witch just doesn't get it. So for $500 bucks I get a lousy room overlooking a dirty back alley and parking garage. But it doesn't end with that. The room is actually quite roomy, very contemporary. But it turns out that the airconditioning is vented into the room through one very small grilled opening. I mean tiny. So of course no air conditioning is flowing to speak of in the room -- and certainly not toward the bathroom/showere area located in the back of the room. So I sweat my xxxx off all night.

Other than the darker-than-prefered lighting throughout the hallways, this is a gorgeous hotel that won't disappoint.

If you are coming to Toronto for business or pleasure and you are looking for a higher end hotel, I highly recommend The Hazelton. The hotel is also a perfect choice for a special occasion. There are so many reasons The Hazelton Hotel is so special. Just to name a few.....starting with the location which just couldn't be better. The Hazelton is situated in a gorgeous area in the heart of Yorkville, surrounded by lovely scenery, boutiques, cafes, and restaurants...everything is literally right at your fingertips. The hotel itself is very glamorous with a stunning lobby, an inviting sitting area and large hallways leading to the guest rooms. After you check in a valet demonstrates how to use your room key to gain access to the elevator (which is a great idea for added security). Then the valet escorts you (and of course your luggage) to your suite. The suite entrance is huge, with his and hers closets, shelves for your suitcases, and two counter areas. There is also a little fridge in this same area stocked with complimentary water and soda. I have never seen such a large amount of space for storage in any hotel... and it really is appreciated. The powder room is exceptionally beautiful. There is granite everywhere you look, basically from floor to ceiling. The bathtub is gynormous, I have never, ever seen such a huge bathtub in my entire life. There is a beautiful glass rainfall shower with powerful water pressure, which is so rare in hotels these days. The heated floors, bathrobes and slippers, weigh scale, and pull out make up mirror, are a few more extras. My favorite thing of all in the powder room... is the tv screen that is built right into the mirror. It's difficult to leave this room, it is just so wonderful! Another thing I really like are the towels. There are at least 4 large towels, two of which are gigantic towel sheets. It is a nice touch when you are staying in a hotel to have the option of extra towels, without having to ask for them. The powder room is also stocked with lovely L'Occittane bath and body products. The main suite is decorated with a hint of the 1940's theme, which makes it have that glamorous feel to it. The drapes are very high quality, and open and close with a push of a button. The large flat screen tv pulls out from the wall, and the lovely desk and leather chair is great for your computer and other incidentals. There is more storage for your belongings in this main area of the suite as well. The room is a very nice size and the reading area with it's cozy chair and floor lamp adds to the overall ambience of the space. Then of course there is the bed, which has high end Italian linens and great pillows. The entire hotel is spotless and extremely well kept and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The restaurant and 24 hour room service are just a few of the many other reasons this hotel stands out. The hotel really is a 'luxury' hotel in every sense of the word.

We checked in on Friday and out today. Overall, we'd say it was a mixed bag. We had a Luxury King Room which was well appointed and very comfortable with complimentary water/soft drinks..but if you wanted an extra L'Occitaine bath product it was $6...huh? The swivel flat screen was nice for the sofa and bed. Our room was on the second floor over the street which was a bit noisy throughout the night. The bathroom was large and really well thought out. Spa/Healthclub: So so -- the workout room was small and with no windows it felt very closed in. We were there at 7am on Saturday morning and there were about 5 other people and it seemed crowded. Spa services were ok. My pedicure was in a facial room with a bowl of water. Not particularly comfortable..in fact it was uncomfortable in some cases when the technician was working due to how you had to sit to position your feet. If they had told me that ahead of time, I would have passed on the pedicure. The line of polish they use is very dated in terms of color choices. For $100+ you'd expect current color selections. The technician was so so. The reception area was not particularly friendly or welcoming. I'd say there's better places to spend your time/money. Services: Housekeeping was very detailed and our room was very clean. Extra pillows from the pillow menu was nice and delivered quickly. Shoe shine and garmet pressing were both executed with speed and good quality. They say that they have \"free internet\" but you actually pay a $9.95 daily \"facility\" fee. Again, this should be transparent when making the reservation. Restaurant: very uneven... we had breakfast included. The server was a bit cold on the first day. This morning, the server was very friendly and accomodating. Late Saturday afternoon we wanted to have a cocktail on the patio and there were plenty of open tables. The \"outside\" hostess could not be bothered with us and told us there were no tables available. The \"inside\" hostess saw us sitting inside and, very kindly, followed up to get us a table outside. She told us we had to clear the table by 5:40 pm. Given that was 55 minutes later, it was not a problem to agree too. We spent $85 on 4 drinks... and watched the hostess turn table and table away. It must be nice to have the option to turn away business in a restaurant. I'm sure if they specified to a number of the people that came up the time they needed the tables, that they would have agreed to leave by then. Most were looking for a drink outside since it was a beautiful day. Valet Staff -- they opened the doors for you but you had to hail your own cab. Very odd for a hotel that's trying to be luxury hotel. Overall, I wanted to like this hotel more than I did. Nothing was particularly wrong with the exception of the spotty restaurant service at times.

The location was fantastic - right on the ritzy Yorkville Avenue with many great restaurants within walking distance. Our first impression was the doormen greeting us by name - they were expecting us which was a nice touch. Check-in was uneventful. Our room was impressive - very well designed, spacious with a large luxurious bathroom with copious amounts of wardrobe space. We loved the free Nespresso coffee machine, selection of tea and complimentary soft drinks in the room. My only complaint about the room was it felt sterile and lacking character. The rest of the hotel felt the same way - it was dark, there didn't appear to be any other guests staying there for the first couple of days, and in a weird kind of way, it all felt a little lonely. Our experience at the restaurant was less impressive. The breakfast was average - the food didn't appear to be fresh, and the service was sloppy and inconsistent. We were often left waiting for silly things like salt and pepper, napkins and spoons while our food got cold. Or side dishes would consistently be forgotten every day during breakfast service. The staff appeared not to care less, and there was never a manager anywhere in sight. Our experience at The Spa was mixed - my partner loved his 60 massage, but I had the unfortunate experience of a masseur who had just been out the back for a smoke and had the lingering stench of cigarettes on her breath - not a nice touch when you're paying $130 for a massage. My biggest gripe with the hotel was the addition of almost $100 worth of taxes per night on top of the $500 I was already paying, which included a mysterious $15 \"facility tax\" which I was told for \"complimentary internet\". Next time I'm in Toronto, I would probably consider The Four Seasons once the renovations are complete.

I did my usual research with trip advisor before we booked it, and saw that a lot of the reviews were positive. I was very optimistic. We got to the hotel at 11pm. It was a bit difficult to find our way to the hotel (we rented a car), but luckily we had google maps! The street that the hotel is on was packed! There was music from every direction, people walking contantly. Seems like quite the party attraction. Once we got to the front of the hotel, it was a bit more confusing; There was a sign that said \"VALLET PARKING\", however there was no place to park in order for the vallet to serve. We had to go around the block two times, until we just decided to pull into what looked like a parking section beside the hotel - little did we know that this zone was actually the hotel vallet parking, NOT the sign. The sign was for the restaurants around the hotel. Oops! Once we got into the hotel, I was amazed at the decorating. It looked amazing! The service at the front desk was good, nothing wrong about it. A man guided us through the elevator (the key was needed for extra security), and then guided us thorugh our room (which was beautiful). Oddly enough, what caught our attention was that no one offered to take our bags. We didn't need the help, however so that wasn't a problem. Our room was room 202 (If I remember correctly) The room (pictures included) was fantastic. There was a large closet, with marble and wooden walls, with no shortage of mirrors. Many places to hang clothes, if needed. Through the closet was the bathroom, with the tallest doors I've seen. Again, the bathroom was completely marble (or granet, I'm not sure which). There was a soaker tub (I didn't use, but there was a detachable head that leaked), and a rain-head shower (again with a second detachable head) that was wonderful. There was a small television built right into the mirror! The lights were controlled by one panel on the wall, as well as heated floors! The bedroom had wonderful beds, and a large TV. There was also a small sitting area with two large chairs and a small coffeetable. At the end of the room was french-door style of windows. Except the doors opened! There was a metal railing, for saftely I presume. That, too was wonderful. We almost always had that open, to get the air in. The drapes were controlled electronically, which my dad loved! There was a large flat screen tv mounted on the wall. The one problem with that was sound. They had controlled the sound so it could only go up to volume 14 (I guess to keep noise down), so you can't really hear some shows! But I fixed that by simply going up to the physical television to change the volume, and voila! All of the pops, water and teas were complimentary (everything except the alcohol). The only problem with that was that you had to either order ice, or wait for turn down service. (My dad didn't want to order ice, because then he would have to give the guy a tip!) The other great thing was the electronic \"do no disturb\" on the light panel. You simply have to press a button, and no one will disturb you! The location was amazing. Lovely choices of food in the area, and two blocks down from the hotel was a strip of stores that I love. On the block of the hotel, however were several higher-class stores (that I didn't want to spend so much on). It was definately a hot spot! Every night there were hundred-thousand dollar cars parked outside! I was amazed at the sound barriers. When the doors were open, the street life was inside the room! But as soon as your closed the doors, you couldn't hear a thing (unless someone came by with reaaly loud music! Of course, the price was high. But in my mind, everything about this hotel made the price worth it! I would definately stay at the Hazelton again!", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDeliciously romantic in the heart of Yorkville\u201d", "Author": "sn2010", "ReviewID": "UR66875284", "Content": "Beautiful rooms, great service (specially valet) and one of the best bar/lounge \"One\" situated at the lobby of the Hazelton Hotel.

Only had breakfast at the hotel and they score high marks for no dreaded buffet but fast and efficient table service. The bar gets quite crowded largely because all of the tables are against the walls, not making the best use of space but they mix a good cocktail and stock Chartreuse, seldom found these days in any bar. Top marks for that. I love a swim and need to do my 822m a day to rach my annual target, so with the promise of a lap pool, thought I would add to the tally. However, the deeply subterranean pool is easily mistaken for a foot bath and the photographs on the website are very misleading. It cannot be more than 8 metres, which hardly qualifies as a lap pool, as one good kick off and you're hitting the other end.

I never stayed here, so I cannot comment on the rooms or facilities. What I can say is that I booked a room here for my mother months in advance (and pre-paid via credit card), as I was scheduled to travel elsewhere during her trip to Toronto. I paid for daily breakfast and asked them to be sure that she knew the location and times. They never told her. I also asked them to do all they could to make her feel comfortable, as she is older and rarely travels. In fact, they barely had the time of day for the one or two questions she had. On top of this, on the night before she was to check in, a staff member sent me an email saying they had to re-process my credit card and if I didn't call them back the room would be cancelled. (This was after they had confirmed to me that all was fine.) I was working in Africa at the time where there were no landlines or stable Internet connections, but still in a panic for my mother I did my best to get through to them, which took me hours. When eventually we spoke (on my cell phone after I was able to recharge it and at my cost) it took more back and forth over a period of hours before the matter was sorted - or at least I had hoped it was. I went to sleep at 3 am without any confirmation from them, or even so much as an apology. It is not trendy, splashy rooms and an expensive price that makes a hotel luxurious - these are just the window dressing for the impeccable service and professionalism that a client expects when s/he shells out a tidy sum. To this day, I cannot believe the manner in which we as clients were treated. The irony is that the hotel I was staying in at the time in the Congo (at a fraction of the price) was up against some serious logistic and infrastructure challenges and still managed to care for me like I mattered. Now one year later, I sincerely hope The Hazelton has learned to make the most out of all it has going for it.

Our room was very warm; on the first night, it stayed above 72F. We called the front desk who informed us that they would cool it centrally but that did not work. The next morning, we were eager to solve this problem. The engineer came to the room and suggested that we turned off all the lights. They also offered to put us in another room (the hotel was quite empty) but the three rooms that they showed us were smaller and less appealing than the one we were in.

But every year, we book a great hotel in our own city, Toronto, become tourists, and take advantage of the many things the city has to offer. This year we decided to stay at The Hazelton Hotel. How many times did we each say, \"I love this hotel!\"? It is, by far, the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Our adventure began with a huge state-of-the-art double room, at what I now consider an exceptional price, of a size that other hotels would call a suite, with (as you'll read in other reviews) a fabulous large marble bathroom with heated flooring and so many other amenities. This hotel has been built with today's state-of-art electronics, and every element takes advantage of that. Buttons for whatever you want to change (drapes, lighting, security). There is no \"please do not disturb\" sign to hang on the doorknob. It's electronic, calling for maid service or privacy. There's a huge swiveling flat screen. But I also noticed that the features are built with quality. The cabinetry is precise. The dressing area, outside the fabulous bathroom, is perfect in size, storage, and function. And then there's the bed (in our case, two). So beyond comfortable that my son had trouble motivating me to leave it our first morning there, even though we were determined to get a fairly early start. So the design and execution of the rooms are perfect. We had dinner at their restaurant \"ONE\". We solicited the help of our server to make choices that we would most enjoy. As in all exceptional restaurants, \"server\" doesn't do the position justice. Dinner was fabulous. ONE also has a concept that, of course, you will want to share tasting with your dinner companions. Worked perfectly for us. The best thing about the hotel (and remember, we are talking about an extremely high standard, given the room and ONE) was the excellence of the staff. To begin with, I walked in and was checked in so quickly without having to give my name. Of course I had to ask, \"How did you know who I was?\". According to my son, the valet read my name from my luggage tag, and said in his headset (technology, technology), \"(My Name) is coming in now.\" They were all ready for me. What a grand surprise. Then we were guided to our room and given a brief but comprehensive tour. I went toward my purse to provide a tip, but was told, \"No, no, totally unnecessary.\" And I felt that -- I had been guided by someone with pride of ownership, although I am fairly certain this was not the owner. My son and I were in the room when staff did turndown service and I couldn't believe the effort that was made. Pillows on our luxurious beds flattened just so, duvets pulled down just so, everything tidied just so. It speaks to the effort, but transparency that goes into every detail. I'm sure some guests don't interact with the staff as much as we did. That's a shame, since they were anticipating our every need, and doing their utmost to make our stay all the better. Whatever they could do for us, they did. I so much enjoyed the conversations I had with a few of them. They were professional, talented and engaging. Did I mention? I loved this hotel. In my mind, the best in TO, small or large, without a doubt.", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cUNBELIEVABLE!\u201d", "Author": "SHOWHOST", "ReviewID": "UR14144927", "Content": "The Hazelton Hotel Is Fairly New But When I Stayed There, There Was No Experience Comparable.

We had dinner in the area, and a few cocktails in the hotel bar, the atmosphere was electric and the crowd was quite intriging. When we retired to our room, champagne was delivered and we were able to take full advantage of its luxury. The television is huge, the couch is cozy, the bed is amazing, the blinds are automatic and again, the bathroom is worth the stay alone. Everything we needed was right at our fingertips, and delivered quickly and without compromise by the pleasant staff. The breakfast was absolutely devine and when we wanted to extend our stay, a much later check-out was granted to us without any question.

We stayed in a deluxe king room which was spacious with a large wardrobe area and a divine bathroom. The bathroom was probably what I liked best about the room, it has great features like under floor heating and a TV built into the mirror, the over sized tub was also lovely. The room decor was gorgeous (much like the rest of the hotel), very sleek and modern, and also incredibly clean. The room has a large flat screen TV, DVD player and free high speed Internet, which were all a nice touch to the room. Each room has a complimentary minibar, however there is only water, tea/coffee and three different types of soda. It was nice to have some free beverages but there were no snacks or alcoholic beverages, if you wanted these you had to call room service to have them delivered to your room, the selection was small and very overpriced, and with some of the alcoholic beverages you had to purchase a full sized bottle. I would have preferred to have a regular well stocked mini bar than the few complimentary beverages in the hotel's current minibar. The room service menu (with the exception of the late night menu) comes from the hotel's restaurant 'One'. The menu was varied and the food at One is good, however it's expensive, which isn't helped by the hotel charging guests a CAD$5 delivery fee for room service (on top of the 17% gratuity they add). Our hotel room faced on to the lane behind the hotel, which firstly wasn't pretty to look at but also was very noisy each morning, so anyone considering this hotel should make sure they're not overlooking this alley. The apartments on top of the hotel are not complete yet so there was also construction noise, so this is another thing anyone considering staying at the hotel in the near future might want to consider. On a more positive note the hotel staff are amazingly friendly and helpful, I honestly couldn't praise them enough. Overall the hotel was comfortable and in a great location.

We were told that the bathroom would be the same, but when we switched, it wasn't even close. But whatever, at least we had our balcony... Then we noticed the nonexistent mini bar. Only ginger ale, soda, and diet soda in the room. anything else has to be delivered by room service (i had 2 cans of club soda delived -- $2.75/can, plus delivery charge, plus 17% -- $14.00). Our balcony faced an alley that is used for emptying dumpsters, so our 2nd floor balcony was miserable to sit on. and on friday night, we sat out there for a smoke / drink after dinner and there was some kind of soot that covered the entire balcony. somehow all of the other 2nd floor balconies had their seat cusions covered, but ours did not, and i'm hoping that our clothes will come clean. the hotel staff said they had never heard of this before - -so tell me why the other balconies had been covered??? the restaurant, one, is awful. the appetizers and salads were average at best. i ordered the huse specialty (braised ontario rabbit) and had to send it back. not only did it arrive 10 minutes before my wife's entree, it was cold, tough, and had no flavor -- basically like eating a soggy piece of cardboard. the truffle risotto side wasn't even close -- basically tasted like a lipton instant risotto pack. bad truffles too. i asked our waiter what was goinig on in the kitched for their signature dish to be bad, and he said that mark (the owner / chef) was never at the restaurant and that the onsite chef didn't know how to run a kitchen properly. i asked our waiter if he could point us in the right direction for nearby jazz club, and he recommended we go to nawlins, just a short taxi ride away. when we arrived, the club he suggested was a tourist trap -- filled with typical fat american tourists wearing eagles' jerseys / cheap jeans / etc. my wife was in marni cocktail dress and i was in a zegna coat -- we were looking for a nice night out. i'm quite certain that the other patrons at nawlins idea of a nice night was cheap beer / cheese fries special. it was a horrible suggestion. of course, the concierge's recommendations weren't any better... the next day we lunch we asked for a nice french restaurant nearby -- the concierge suggested bistro 990, and it was about a 20 minute walk. my wife and i walked all the way to the restaurant -- only to find that it was not open for lunch. i would never recommend this hotel. bad service, bad advice, no attention to detail -- mediocrity at it's finest. heck, they only provided turn-down service on one of the nights.", "Date": "September 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cService???

They try to be hip and cool in the design, but instead it is a disjointed attempt to be hip. Its cold and boring. The service is a farce. room service from some fancy chef took an hour and tasted like some fast food order. Later we saw this chef sitting with customers in the restaurant drinking. Maybe he should be in the kitchen. I love the Yorkville location where this place is but this pl;ace is bookended with a kids club on one side, a construction zone on the other and a cheap loud pub accross the street. And if that was not bad enough, the hotel's restaurant patio is one floor below the rooms, creating noise till very late. The finishing touch were the two dozen or so Harleys in the front at midnight. Stay away. This place is a joke. When checking out I tried to explain my displeasure. This was met with some manager's condesending comments, still calling it Toronto's only 5 star property. So I asked how did they get the rating?
