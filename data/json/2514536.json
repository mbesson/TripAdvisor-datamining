First impression was quite good, the reception staff being very helpful. However the nightmare had yet to begin. The room was at the bottom of the building and although we had booked a double room the size of the bed was NOT a double, more like a three quarter, being pushed against a wall. There was no room for two people to access the room at the same time and the ensuite was just a joke. First day breakfast was okay but Saturday was a disaster. All free tables were cluttered with dirty crockery so we had to clean this away. There were no clean plates so people were using saucers to have their breakfast on, this consequently meant that there were no saucers for the cups. There is only one waitress and she was totally out of her depth.

Location: Really close to Paddington station and many bus services. Also an easy walk through Hyde park to some museums/attractions, and to the start of Oxford st for shopping. Perfect. Rooms (and all that): The room was big enough for us to sleep and have our clothes spread a bit. The shower is tiny, so without being funny, if you're a rather large person you might have some issues with this. We were on the 4th floor so noise was no problem and after walking a lot around London, we slept quite well each night, although the walls are thin (you can hear other people sneeze and when everyone is going to breakfast in the morning). Cleanliness/service/communication: This was our one really problem, and the reason for 3 stars instead of 4 overall. The case around the flush button on our toilet was off as it had been broken previously, meaning we had to reach in and pull the leaver manually (not all that clean, and the open case caused a mildly unpleasant odour). We asked for someone to look into it during the day. At night, it wasn't fixed so we asked another reception staff, who had no communication with the first receptionist about the issue, to look into it again. The next afternoon, we followed up again with the first receptionist and were told it couldn't be fixed before our stay ended. The broken case/flush itself was a mild inconvenience, it was that we needed to follow up a few times instead of being informed from the start of the problem.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cService with a smile\u201d", "Author": "Steven C", "ReviewID": "UR122084934", "Content": "The front desk reception people are friendly and helpful.

I stayed at castleton hotel for a week with my parents (3 people) and we reserved the quadruple room. We stayed at the lowest floor (the basement) and from what I've read in Tripadvisor the basement rooms were suppose to be very noisy.. but to be honest nothing bothered me at all (my room was next door to the breakfast room, like literally beside the breakfast room) and in all the 6 nights Ive spend there nothing ever woke me up. My mother who is a very light sleeper didn't mind the ''noises'' as well, we couldnt hear a thing. The room was very small (compared to american standard rooms) but hey it is Europe we cannot require a big room for a good price... The beds were comfortable and I actually liked the room, even though it was small I felt comfortable in there and thats all that really matters. The bathroom was indeed very small as well and very simple, but very well cleaned and thats all that really matters to me! One thing about the bathroom that actually made me laugh was the size of the sink, so tiny.. but that was not big deal at all. There is no mini bar in the room, that was one thing that actually surprised me! BUT again that was not a problem, at least not for us... we placed the beverages next to the window, if you intend to go to london in the winter time I recommend you to do the same, it actually works! The staff (at least to us) were always very helpful, patient and attentive, I have nothing against them at all.. And about the breakfast, I do not know about it, cause I did not eat breakfast in the hotel at anytime. But my father actually tried it and thought the food was alright, my mother on the other hand despised everything about it.. I think it depends a lot.. but according to my father the food was the traditional english breakfast.. so i guess it depends of how demanding you are.. In general i think the hotel was great, better than what I expected.. It is well located (1 min walk or maybe less) from the Paddington station and also close to bus stops.. The hotel was well cleaned and the staff were very helpful. Yes I do recommend this hotel to people who are not so into luxury things. And yes I would stay there again !

Having stayed previously in another hotel on Sussex Gardens (which was extremely disappointing), I was a bit dubious about all the hotels in this particular part of town. I expected that they would all be run the same way. But the reviews overall for Castleton Hotel were favourable. Thus I decided to book it. The Castleton Hotel\u00b4s best attribute is it\u00b4s location. It\u00b4s conveniently close to Paddington Station and an assortment of shops, bars and eateries. And only a few stops away from both Oxford and Piccadilly Circus Stations, and the West End theatres and restaurants. The staff at this establishment were friendly, welcoming and courteous. Always saying hello and goodbye/night. And that to me is always a nice start or end to the day. As I\u00b4ve discovered on my numerous trips to London, it\u00b4s not common to be helped with tour, theatre, restaurant, or directions assistance. So I can\u00b4t judge this hotel in that department. But free advice in that area would\u00b4ve earnt bonus points. The hotel on outside appearance was tidy and presentable. With the foyer/entrance area being neat and presentable. The only downside was getting in the elevator (the elevator floor could\u00b4ve been vaccumed a little). Upon reading previous reviews on the Castleton, I\u00b4d read that some rooms and bathrooms were rather small. In relation to mine this was an understatement! Granted I was expecting to deal with this, the smallness of my room turned out to be the only real disappointment of my stay. There was hardly room to swing a cat (as the expression goes)! Luckily for me I was not planning to waste any non sleeping/showering time in my room. And London is one of the geatest cities to entice you outdoors. Before heading outdoors, breakfast needed to be eaten. This was included in the price. It was standard cereal, toast, eggs (scrambled or fried), bacon and juice or tea/cofee. All you really need. The breakfast room was very small and compact. It was 2 floors under ground. And there were no windows or views. A touch disappointing. Thus I only ate downstairs once during my 4 night stay. The eating hours were between 7-9am. Which while your travelling can be just a bit early. Just one hour more would\u00b4ve been more flexible. Most hotels I have stayed at in London have had breakfasts between 7-10am. Much traveller friendly! Apart from that, I had a pleasant stay. And would return without hesitation.

The walls were knicked and the paint was chipped in the room. One of the framed artworks had the picture falling out of the matting. Windows and window ledges were dirty. This all gave me the distinct impression that no effort was put into upkeep or presentation. No bedside lights. No chairs, luggage stands or even hooks to put stuff on, I had to put everything on the floor. There was a closet, however it was small and located at the far end of the room which required walking around both beds to get to. Two other room entrances were near to us, and the doors were not designed to prevent loud slamming, which was disruptive. The flat-screen TV was mounted way too high on the wall, so that when sitting on the bed (the only place to watch the TV from) we couldn't see the picture well because we could not adjust the angle. All the images appeared dark, as the TV is meant to be viewed straight on. The carpet in the hotel is in a general grubby and off-putting condition. The breakfast is free, but mediocre with fatty, greasy bacon and sausages that have been sitting under the heat lamp for goodness knows how long. I opted for cereal and the muesli had peanuts in it, very odd. One of the servers rudely insisted upon removing our toast rack with one piece left in it (no idea why, as we were not finished), and when I resisted she removed the toast with her bare hand and put it on my plate. She then proceeded to set the tables grabbing the eating ends of the utensils, I will not die from this behavior, however it made me wonder what other health issues and good restaurant practices were being neglected. We reserved for three nights and had to pay for everything on check-in. When the hotel is so bad, you don't wonder why they want people to pay before they see their room. We wanted to check out after the first night because the place was in such disrepair. We were told cancellation required 48 hours notice.

The breakfast was excellent at Castleton. The food there was ready to be served and piping hot. The scrambled eggs and hotdog was my favourite. It gives me a homely feeling. Other hotels i stayed gives me cold scrambled eggs, but this hotel served eggs that are piping hot and scrumptious. The hotdog was huge and it fills up my stomach quickly. Location from heathrow airport to the hotel is easy. Just take heathrow connect / heathrow express. There are plenty of bus services from paddington bus stop to Marble Arch / Oxford Street. It was so easy for me to get to oxford street just one direct bus! The reception allow us to place our hand carry in the storage compartment for free after much negotiation. Cons: L114 has no remote control. There was no place to hang our clothes and towels while bathing. The hairdryer was spoilt. The queen sized bed in the corner was freezing cold. My parents complained about it. The key was huge and bulky. But it is still traditional. The phone charges is expensive! Other than that, there was no more cons. Castleton hotel always gives me a homely feeling and the lift, key was all so special! I never see such special lift before. The key is so traditional and funny! Fast food was easily located around the hotel. Try KFC it is fantastic and worth!

The room was small, but not overly so for a single. It had a discrete A/C unit, which worked nicely and is a rarity in a property such as this from what I understand. While the window didn't look out onto much, there was a good amount of noise filtering up from the street below until fairly late in the night. Light sleepers might find this problematic. The bathroom was a single-piece \"drop-in\" unit that felt about as big as that on an airplane, and I can't imagine anyone of larger proportions would even fit into the shower (which itself is not the best design - water seems to splash out everywhere). I found myself thinking I would have preferred a larger & better appointed shared bathroom to this tiny private one.

We travelled down from the Midlands on Sunday morning and decided to spend the day sightseeing so phoned the hotel to inform them that it was likely to be late evening when we arrived and we were assured everything would be ready whatever the time. We finally arrived at 8.00pm shattered and soaked (it threw it down just as we got to Trafalgar Square) and quickly parked right outside the door (there was a skip outside but it didn't affect access in any way) We were asked to pay up front which is no different to other places we have stayed and were asked to leave our car key on reception incase of emergencies and were shown where everything was and were given a key to room 305 on the 3rd floor, there is a lift but we chose to use the stairs, and braced ourselves for the usual budget room. Boy were we surprised, everything from the bedding to decoration was top quality, the quilt and pillows looked and felt as though you were the first to use them, the bed was firm but very comfy with no stray springs and there was 1 bedside table and a lovely side table and 2 chairs. There was plenty of wardrobe space complete with hangers, a tea tray for 2, a hairdryer, free toiletries and 2 lovely soft bathtowels! (these got replaced each morning when the room was cleaned and the bed made) We were amazed at what we were getting for the price. We both showered straight away to freshen up and yes it is a tiny capsule bathroom but it was powerfull hot and did the job, i didn't find it a problem at all and could move around quite freely. We then decided to go for a wander and check out the area, less than a minute away out the door and to the right we were on a busy street full of shops restuarants cafes and even a mcdonalds, by then we were starving and not knowing the area decided to ask the night receptionist for recommendations and he directed us to an indian restuarant where we had a lovely meal and drinks for less than \u00a330, then shattered we decided to have an early night. As expected the bed was very comfy, the room was warm and the only noises we heard were from the pigeons sitting on the fire escape outside our window. Breakfast is served from 7am till 9am in a lovely room in the basement and there was plenty of choice, we started with cereal and fresh orange while our choice of either scrambled or fried egg was prepared and then helped oursleves to sausage bacon and beans from the hotplate, toast and tea or coffee was also served straight away. We spent all day Monday shopping and found everything within walking distance of the hotel, about 20 - 30 minutes away was oxford street, regent street and the british museum then after tea we found Park Lane and Harrods (open till 8pm) about the same distance away, but if you don't fancy walking Paddington tube is just minutes away from the hotel. We had to check out by 11am on Tuesday but the staff were very flexible and were happy for us to leave our car for a bit longer to go for a last walk before we headed to the Natural History Museum and then home. We paid \u00a3154 for 2 nights bed and breakfast in a double room and onsite parking and considered it excellent value, we asked to see a family room while we were there and were shown a room downstairs next to the breakfast room which was just as nice as the one we used but had a wet room and we will definately be booking in the next few weeks to come back with our teenage daughters and i for one can't wait it was a pleasure to stay there!", "Date": "February 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxfordshire", "Title": "\u201cExcellent value for money\u201d", "Author": "Oxf0rdGirl", "ReviewID": "UR55454855", "Content": "We stayed here for one night in February 2010 and thought the hotel was really good value for money.

The staff were very attentive and certainly were not discourteous which is what I normally find in London Hotels!

I can believe it because for anyone on dollars it is really really expensive! As Hotels are a major expense we had a very hard time finding something within the budget of a family of five but really lucked out be finding the Castleton a few steps from Paddington Station. Despite it being the cheapest place we found it left very little to be desired. While generally European hotel rooms are small by American standards the Castleton has a variety of room sizes. If you get there and are not satisfied we observed the hotel staff graciously changing a couples\u2019 room to one that was larger. Besides the room being clean, adequate in size, relatively cheap, breakfasts reasonable and the hotel being in an amazingly convenient location the staff is an additional reason for choosing the Castleton. We\u2019ve paid much more money for hotels and not encountered the caring and helpfulness given us by at least 5 different desk personnel. This doesn\u2018t mean that all had the same level of computer skills to help us with the Internet etc. but they all tried very hard to make our stay pleasurable. For example, waiting for our children to meet us in the lobby for our departure to Heathrow we were informed that they had hit a transportation problem and we wouldn\u2019t be getting to the airport as early as we had hoped. On hearing this and seeing the anxious look on my wife\u2019s face, the desk clerk, Ahmer (who had previously explained the cheapest way to get us to Heathrow) asked if we had e-tickets. When we said yes, within minutes he presented us with our boarding passes which meant we would have a much speedier check-in. Some tips: stay away from most of the restaurants between the Station and the hotel. Ask the staff where to eat around the hotel. Second London has become a transportation disaster. We had 5 various \u201cdiversions\u201d which included getting on the tube and hearing the announcement that the station we wanted was closed! Buy the \u201cOyster\u201d card \u2013 definitely cheapest way to travel and learn how to use the busses \u2013 while maybe not faster they sometimes were much more convenient and are cheaper than the tube.

It was a good choice. My daughter and I were in room 404, up on the top floor, for the week after Christmas and it was lovely and cozy, with a window over the front street that we could open and close as we liked to change the temperature in the room. (Someone else has posted a photo of it - rust color walls, nice window, \"space station\" bathroom with plenty of hot water, flat-screen TV, tea making supplies...). The beds(we had twin beds) were comfortable with warm thick comforters - which we didn't really need as the room was nice and warm. It was very quiet, except when our neighbors came home late in the evening and had trouble with their door (I suspect they were a little too inebriated to get the key into the lock - there are no deadbolts, by the way, just normal bedroom door locks, which is a little unnerving, but access to the Hotel is limited so we felt safe enough). We could also hear newcomers as they wheezed their way to the final landing outside our door with their luggage. The Hotel is entirely non-smoking, which is a huge plus. The breakfast was made to order (ask for the scrambled eggs, and the English bacon is a delight), with all the toast, juice, cereal, tea, coffee, etc., you want. The Breakfast Room was a pleasant start to the day - breakfast is served 7 to 9:00am, so if you go in there at 7:00 it is almost empty and quite pleasant and you can linger a while. All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly, giving advice as to transportation routes and shopping destinations. This hotel is a very short distance from Paddington Station, with transportation from there to everywhere. (The #7 bus will take you directly to the British Museum along the High Street (shopper's paradise - Soylent Green Is People!), and the Circle Line Tube will take you directly to the Albert and Victoria, Natural History, and Kensington.) No matter where you are in the city, if you spot a bus going to Paddington it takes you home again. We ate a huge breakfast every day, had tea and scones at the V & A museum for a late lunch twice and a good sandwich at the British Museum a few times (you need more than one day for that museum), and had supper near the hotel (either a pasty bought over at Paddington Train Station or a pizza) and so freed up money to take a last-day-there tour out to the ruins at Stonehenge/ Glastonbury/ Avesbury (Anderson Tours, picked up and dropped off at the Hotel door - excellent, inexpensive tour in a mini-bus). There's a Marks and Spencer and another grocery store (plus several other shops - including one that sells Paddington Bear items) at the station, so you can get items to eat in your room if you'd rather not deal with any of the many nearby restaurants. (Our room cleaner must wonder, as every morning there was an empty quart of milk and an empty box of cookies in the trash even if we ate out that night. We fought jet lag with late night TV and cookies and milk!) The only negatives, and they are ~barely~ negatives in my book, are: 1) there are no phones in the rooms so if you don't have a cell phone you have to rely on messages left for you at the desk (they are very nice about that) and use the public phone halfway down the block for outgoing calls; 2) there is no lift in the building - again, this is barely a negative, except for the first day when we had to haul our luggage up four flights of stairs after an entire day on airplanes, trains, and buses. By the end of our week's stay we were bounding up the stairs with no problems; 3) there are only 4 TV stations; and, 4) that you eventually do have to leave - we stayed a week and wish we were back there right now. I am torn as to posting this - it really is a wonderful little hotel. I would highly recommend it to anyone wanting a quiet, peaceful room. Still, I'd like to keep it a secret so we can always find a room there. We arrived a few hours before check-in, but the desk clerk went ahead and let us have the room early as we were about out on our feet and it was freezing cold outside.

The chambermaid was friendly and did a really good service of my room in my absence. I stayed for 2 nights at the Castleton at the beginning of this month. The proximity of Paddington tube station to the hotel is a bonus - just a two minute walk. I will certainly be using this hotel again when next in London.

Myself and 3 friends stayed in the quad room which consisted of 4 single beds, with a small living area and a bathroom (toilet,sink and shower). The room itself was clean and tidy and the beds were comfortable. There we no tea and coffee making facilities and the room was a little dark (we were downstairs in the basement - although we did have a window) but i didnt expect it to be perfect at the price we paid. The hotel is really close to paddington underground station and has a great selection of little pubs and restaurants in the surrounding area. The reason for our stay was a trip to Wembley Arena - the hotel is great for this purpose and is only a few stops away on the tube (about 30 minutes door to door). Breakfast the next morning was good - a small english breakfast (bacon, sausage, egg and beans) with unlimted tea/coffee and toast All in all I would recommend this hotel if all you need is a no frills convienent good value place to stay.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "goodtimerNottingham", "ReviewID": "UR17359321", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for two nights 27th and 28th june, Ive stayed in far worse places and i think this hotel is value for money. i agree the rooms were small and amenities could have been better,.but as a budget hotel.it came up over my expectations.All the staff were very friendly and polite and really made me feel at home.The breakfast was superb.just what you need before hitting the london sights.Only complaint i have is there was no coffee/tea making facilties which were certainly required.", "Date": "June 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cornwall", "Title": "\u201cBelow average for price\u201d", "Author": "Treworga", "ReviewID": "UR16034609", "Content": "This is a fairly cheap hotel in a convenient location close to Paddington Station and OK for a short stopover, but it's let down on basics I would still expect, even at their price.
