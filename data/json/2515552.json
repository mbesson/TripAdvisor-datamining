I had stayed at the hotel several times in the past few years and while it had not been updated to the new Marriott Courtyard standards, the property was \"ok\" and the service always excellent. I happened to check on the hotel website a week or so prior to our New Year's Weekend arrival and discovered that the hotel was undergoing a MAJOR renovation. Great for the hotel, bad for me. Had a received advance notice if this via email (they had all my contact information) I would have changed locations. 10 days prior to the stay on a holiday weekend that was no longer an option. Arrived at the hotel to find: Portable bar type unit as a front desk Portable bar as the bar, Temporary tables as the dining area All of this in an semi open type area with strip heaters on the ceiling. Had to walk through the \"real\" lobby that is totally torn up to get to the only working elevator. No temporary covering on the pathway to the elevator so dust everywhere Drywall dust and minor debris scattered in the guest corridor. Arrived at our suite (had been upgraded due to Marriott Rewards status. The room had a strong mold/mildew smell. My wife opened the drapes to see outside and discovered the room darkening shade was covered with mold. This room should not have been in service. They obviously don't actually inspect the rooms for potential health issues. Back to the front desk where we were moved to a standard room (was fine with that) that was newly renovated. Nice room but.. the new toilet leaked at the base and there were two lights in the bathroom that did not work. Not fixed during the two night stay. The stay was on a free night award (not points related). I was not going to complain about the situation but when the hotel pulled 20,000 from my wife's account in addition to using the free night certificate that was already attached to the reservation. Since I had to talk with Marriott to get the points refunded, I made them aware of the lack of notice about the construction and the service failures. In the resulting dialog with the property it became clear that they just don't care about guest satisfaction. Their response was an offhand \"sorry\" They are off my list of properties I stay at in SoCal.

Normally if I book through Priceline, I feel I really can't gripe about what they give us..but it's a shame the Courtyard didn't opt to either lower their star rating (no way should it still be a 3 star property with major construction going on!) OR just close your doors for a short time while the main areas are a mess. The entire lobby is under construction with workers, dust, equipment, etc. greeting you right when you walk through the doors. They have a little temporary front desk set up off to the side. From there, you traipse through the work zone (the lobby is torn down to bare bones folks!) onto paint splattered carpet and dust to the elevator. We were on the 2nd floor and the room looked like a normal Courtyard room .. so I'm assuming it had been recently redecorated (from what I've read about the former outdated Southwest decor .. it looked nothing like that). It was small, but clean. There was a note on the desk mentioning the construction process starting at 8 am. Wrong! We were woken up each morning a little after 7 am, to the sounds of workers moving stuff around, setting things up (I guess?), clomping heavily on the floor above us, drilling and hammering on the ground floor below us, etc. It was noisy and we couldn't sleep. So much for our little vacation getaway in San Diego. I couldn't wait to leave. : ( I'm all for them sprucing up the place .. but for Courtyard to be selling rooms (at ANY price) while the hotel is anything BUT a restful, inviting place to spend the night is flat out horrible.

I stayed two weekend nights in June when they were full. They promptly picked me up with their shuttle from the Amtrak station, saving me $15 cab fare. I had called them in the morning to ask them to block a room away from the freeway, after reading other posts about the noise. Certainly, while on the street walking to Old Town, the freeway noise is pervasive, so I appreciate those who posted that. Check in was prompt and the staff were helpful and friendly the entire stay. My room was clean and in good order. The bed had a variety of pillow firmnesses, and was covered in clean sheets with only one of those little footscarfs at the bottom of the bed. This is a Marriott standard, so don't know where the dirty bedspread comment could have come from. The mattress was not worn out. There was a large easy chair and it was in good repair. No stains, no worn out arms, no rips. There were 3 lamps, enuf to light the room. There was a pull out work table, lots of countertop in good repair, and an oversized luggage rack. The room does have the sink outside the bathroom, and this was clean and functional, but to my mind old fashioned, but I know a lot of people prefer that. The bathroom was clean and large. The shower curtain rod needed a screw tightened, and there was mold on the safety handle caulking, but none any where else in the bathroom. Good shower head, adjustable. I reported both those minor items for repair when I checked out. I did not need to adjust the room temperature, so I did not use the wall unit. These are not my favorite, and others had said they weren't fresh. As I had forgotten to pack most of my allergy medication, I didn't want to go there. I had no allergy problems in the room. i do think the hallway and room have that hotel cleaning fluid smell that you find a lot of place. The wallpaper, paint, furniture finishes etc were in good order except where the metal folding closet doors can gore the back of the bathroom door. There were dings there, but understandable. The color scheme will not win any prizes. It's blah. I always consider hotel room rugs to be dirty, and as it so happend, had needed to wash the slipper I take when traveling. As their soles did not get black there, I consider this rug to be less dirty than most. With a navy color, no other way to tell. No stains/spots, well vaccuumed. Staying only 1 night, with plenty of everything, I didn't have the maid come in at all, but as my room was clean, I suspect it's good. Large flatscreen TV with HBO, pretty standard channels. The breakfast was not overly pricey for a hotel breakfast, and as I was here on business, I didn't have time to hunt around for an alternative. Buffet selection was large: eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, all the standard breads, yoghurts, fruits, juices. There was a guy to make you an omelet. The restaurant is dark and not attractively decorated but it was not the end of the world, especially for a quick breakfast. The location was good. It was literally a 2 block walk to the night life, dozens of restaurants and shops of Old Town, plus historic sights. It is 2 miles from USD, which is why I chose it. When my meetings ended early, they ran me to the Amtrak station specially so I could catch an earlier train home. Their regular run was a very close call for this particular train. Again, this saved me money. (They nornally shuttle to the airport and train station every hour on the hour) A friend came back with me for a drink one night, and we sat by the fireplace and chatted til she had to leave for dinner with her family. She found it nice and commented it was much better than where some other colleagues were staying. Cool weather and busy schedule meant no pool time for me, but lots of people were using it. I expect they will do some redecorating and polish this place up, but there is no reason to avoid it.

Rate was $99 - $129 + tax (rate change in the stay) booked off the Marriott web site. Lets get the worries out of the way. This hotel is located next to a busy freeway. They do provide ear plugs - never a good sign. Our rooms were not too bad - on the side of the hotel towards the back the back. There was audible background freeway noise when I didn't have the aircon fan on. When I did the fan hum drowned out the freeway. I didn't have a problem with it and have stayed in a lot nosier hotels. Those with rooms overlooking the freeway may well have caused for complaint - watch your room selection. The rest is positive. The location is excellent a couple of blocks from Old Town and 5 mins walk from the trolley which takes you downtown. $2.50 one way, $5 for a day pass and $12 for a 3 day pass. With downtown hotels costing about double I'd recommend Old Town as a location to stay. Even the cab fare back late at night was only $16. Old Town itself is a pleasant location with plenty of bars, restaurants, etc. Thanks to Trip Advisor I parked on street - thus avoiding the nightly parking charge. However, BE WARNED, if parking on even the slightest down hill slant make sure your steering and therefore wheels are angled to the kerb. I didn't and the result was a $47 parking violation which, more or less, negated the street parking saving. Room was fine (standard Courtyard), free internet worked and they had a couple of internet connected PCs in the lobby which took USB keys with printers attached. Perfect. The exercise room had two joggers, two bikes and a X-trainer and free weights all in good working order. The pool is tiny and there is a nice veranda area. A nice touch is the free wine and cheese most evenings around 5:00pm in the lobby. Didn't eat in the hotel as Old Town is just up the road and has great choices for both breakfast and evening meals.

There is a very nice desk area with a great workspace, desk lamp, outlets for computer and cell phone right on the desk.

I called the hotel when I landed and the shuttle arrived within 15 min. It saves about $15 in cab fare. I had a very early flight leaving and asked for a 5:00am shuttle that morning.

This Marriott is a little smaller than some .. in fact I think it started life as a Holiday Inn years ago. The staff was very friendly and very helpful. And the entire hotel was in very good shape, nicely appointed and well kept. I had a small king room on the top (3rd) floor facing north. The freeway was in sight out my window, but the noise was almost non-existent. In fact the room was very quiet even with neighbors occupying rooms on both sides of mine. The room was roomy even though it was one of the smaller ones. It had a desk space and large overstuffed chair & ottoman for reading and relaxing too. The AC unit was quieter than many I've experienced, but it seemed to stay on forever. Not a lot of channels on TV but they do have the movies you can pay for & watch. There are several computers with free internet access in the lobby. The breakfast area was like a small restaurant which doubled as their cocktail lounge in the evening, and they had a covered outdoor patio which I used for every meal I ate there. The lobby had a nice assortment of chairs and couches, and every evening from 4:30 to 5:30 they had a free wine and cheese social hour which I took advantage of too. They have several meeting rooms so be prepared to deal with the inevitable groups that hold seminars & meetings here. The pool was small but nice .. however access to the pool was odd. The only way to the pool was thru the lobby, and then thru the restaurant or the outdoor patio and past the meeting rooms. So one would have to tromp by dozens of people to get to the pool. The patio was in use much of the day by a business group, so hardly anyone used the pool during those times. hmmm , not much else to complain about .... my room had a very small counter space next to the bathroom sink... It's two easy blocks to the heart of Old Town, and I ate dinner up there several nights. I recommend a restaurant called Zocalo's .
