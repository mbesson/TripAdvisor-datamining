Had the hotel made provision for this? Unfortunately not and pandemonium ensued. We were fortunate as we arrived a lot later than the first wave of check-ins who were STILL waiting in reception or had returned to reception trying to sort out the non-working electronic room keys. It was major kerfuffle! Finally checked into room - asked for champagne glasses. We are, to this day, still waiting. The bedroom and bathroom were nice - self contained kitchen was nice, but far from well-appointed. Lounge and furnishings were grubby and covered in blackish grimy wear and tear marks. UGH The hotel management had displayed a \"we are upgrading\" notice but that didn't help us!

The staff are friendly, helpful as they can be under the circumstances and don't deserve to have to deal with the issues that arise as a result of this hotel being below standard . . . certainly not the four stars it claims. there is clearly no quality control practised here. Where to start with the problems: For a refurbished room the walls were in need of a good lick of paint; the blind in the bedroom was broken and couldn't be opened; drawers in wardrobe were broken and collapsed when attempting to open any of them; the safe was locked and needed staff to open it; no dishwasher (website states each room has one) and not even a dish cloth to compensate for the absence of the dishwasher; remote for one television was broken and taped together; no drinking glasses in the room; washing machine didn't work and dryer worked intermittently; button on toilet broken and no plug for the bathroom sink; no sharp knife in kitchen; one teaspoon and very little other cutlery; very little in the way of cooking pots and pans; two of the three lights in living room had blown globes; kitchen floor was sticky. Some of the issues such as light globes, dishwashing equipment, kitchen utensils, sink plug etc could be easily fixed. to assist with clothes washing we were offered the use of a washing machine in another apartment, but guess what it didn't work properly either (washed but would not rinse or spin). staff eventually took our washing and made other arrangements to have it washed and dried (they shouldn't have to do this). This is by far the worst establishment that I have stayed in and certainly not the worth the price that I paid. this will be one group of hotels that I will steer clear of in future which is a shame because it is in a great location and parking was available at a reasonable price given the length of time we were staying.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunedin, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cJUST WHAT WE WANTED - NEEDED!!\u201d", "Author": "MrsJenNZ", "ReviewID": "UR126938191", "Content": "We booked through a 'third-party' hoping that we would get the requested a one bedroom 'share-twin' apartment.

We had a very small balcony, but when outside it gave an insight into the city traffic ... even from 9 floors up. It was quiet with windows shut, the air cond worked, though drafty depending on where you sat. All staff were approachable and extremely pleasant. We had occasion to ask many questions within first 12 hours, but all our questions and requests were taken seriously and respectfully. We had issues with the washing machine in the apartment, but this was replaced with a new one within 24 hours! The spa was not working which was a shame, but the pool was available. It was a little 'cool' and didn't get any warmer over the 7 days we were there, but we were told it is checked often and is the required temperature.

Eventually after 24 hours, we were \"upgraded\" to a premium room, which was exactly the same only bigger with the added extras of no net curtains and badly fitted curtains despite looking directly into an office block and single glazed windows that had a tendency to come off the runners. The crockery was mismatched, chipped and badly worn in both rooms, the utensils and cooker were old and there was no way I would have used them for food preparation. We were repeatedly told that the building was to have a full refurbishment but when we pointed out that we had booked because of their advertising literature and it was a gross misrepresentation, all we got was a shrug of shoulders.
