The only good comments I can make are (1) the hotel is nicely located on the far edge of the Jordaan district in a quiet area and (2) the room rate was inexpensive and included a small but adequate breakfast. I would add that our beds were adequate and had warm blankets. Balanced against these are significant issues. The hotel's facilities are out-dated and badly need renovations. Although I detected no unpleasant odors, the hotel's general appearance suffers from neglect. The bathroom sink and shower were rusted and leaky. The carpeting was frayed. The room was small and contained the bare minimum... beds, table, chair, television, and telephone. The staff person at the desk was indifferent and offered very little information beyond the location of the room. The hotel lacks an elevator and has steep steps (as in most Amsterdam small hotels), with some rooms on the fifth level. There is a breakfast room but no other public area for relaxation. In short, if you have a short stay and price and convenience of location are your primary considerations, you might consider this hotel. On the other hand, if comfort and ambience are important to you, I could not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel and friendly staff!\u201d", "Author": "Emmita_1", "ReviewID": "UR112896290", "Content": "I absolutely recommend the Acacia hotel.

Even the steep stairs didn't bother me as they are pretty much standard in all of Holland. The miserable, almost Auto-Pilot reception and being given a key and pointed to the stairs, wasn't the nicest welcome. The room was hot, and pretty battered, really needing a spruce up. The beds where so stupidly soft it was like sleeping on a blancmange. And the bathroom was horrible and in need of some care. The breakfast was ok, though and the place does have a nice feel to it at breakfast, but the rest really needs updating. Oh and when I woke up on the final day I realised that there where no towels in our room. By that time I just wanted to get out so we just paid (Not by debit card as they don't accept them?) and left. I Will go back to Amsterdam I Will definitely go back to Jordaan.

Much to our dismay, the houseboat we had smelled moldy and looked like its pea green linoleum floors and walls hadn't been washed in eons. What was suppose to be a romantic bedroom consisted of two small twin beds pushed together so that you had a nice piece of 2x4 running down the middle. The pillows were not pillows, but seemingly lumpy sacks of potatoes. When I complained to the very serious and not particularily friendly receptionist that our houseboat looks nothing like the pictures advertised in the internet, he merely asserted \"that is not your room\". (Made me wonder whether the rooms shown on Acacia Hotel's website were from an imaginary place altogether!) I asked to change to a regular room and he offered a double room on the 3rd floor. Keep in mind that the spiral staircase leading to the 3rd floor is about 2 ft wide and extremely steep.

I really rate the hotel as above average because of its location, which we really couldn't have been happier with. At the end of the day it was so nice to get away from the overwhelming crowds in the city center and return to our very quiet, very Dutch neighborhood. If you stay in the Jordaan and do plan to rent a bike, check out City Bike just a few blocks away from Hotel Acacia. The front desk can give you a brochure.", "Date": "June 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cPast Its Prime\u201d", "Author": "Offseason", "ReviewID": "UR3530948", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel Acacia in May. We planned to spend six nights in their houseboat but had to spend the first night in the hotel as the boat was booked. The hotel room was on the third floor. First, the staircase was steeper than some ladders I have used. Very tough to lug luggage up the ladder to our room. The room itself was smaller than most office cubicles. The lumpy bed was tucked into a space so tight you could only access it on one side. Think RV type space. Very tough for two people to share. The bathroom was small and very worn. Cigarette burns on the sink as well as cracking and peeling counters overall. The TV was fuzzy and all the furniture was very worn. On the second night, we moved to the house boat. The space was not anything like what their website photos show. You actually only get half the boat, not the whole thing. The furniture was worn, the blinds were broken and dirty. One window pane was actually missing. The floor was old linoleum that was not that clean. The kitchenette consisted of two hot plates, a small sink and a very small refrigerator. No oven, no microwave and no supplies at all. The coffee maker was old and dirty. No filters, no sugar, no salt or pepper any basics at all. Lastly, the hot water heater didn't work. We called the manager and he got it working. That brought the water up to a bout 60 degrees. We left for another hotel the next morning and will never go back. The staff was nice and appeared to understand our disappointment but were not in a position to do anything about it. Very bad experience.", "Date": "June 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bergen, Norway", "Title": "\u201cGreat value!\u201d", "Author": "Jensen79", "ReviewID": "UR3530105", "Content": "Me and my girlfriend stayed at the modern houseboat.

A little off the beaten path but not too far away from anything interesting. There are many fantastic cafes and restaurants nearby--the Jordaan is a cozy, nice neighborhood.

Considering that it only cost $80/ night for a 2 bedroom room w/ private bath, shower & tv. The room was pretty small but that was something I assumed ahead of time. THe beds were very comfortable although frighteningly close together. THe bathroom facilities were fine and the tv was nice because we watched alot of Euro MTv at night/ early morning. Free breakfast every morning is a definite + although I only managed to make it for breakfast once. Just don't expect too much -typical euro breakfast w/ coffee, bread, some meat & cheese. The stirway up to the rooms was scary though. Probably the steepest and narrowest stairway you'll ever see but par for the course in amsterdam. THe staff was very friendly and helpful. Just make sure to pay w/ cash or it's an extra 15% per night. Not a bad walk to the main part of the city either. Overall I give the Hotel Acacia a solid B rating.
