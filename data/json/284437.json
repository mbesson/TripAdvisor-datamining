We came by train and it was very easy to jump right on the #1 water bus to the Sant'Angelo stop. The directions they sent us were very clear and it was an easy 5 minute walk to the hotel. It is located in a lovely little square that makes it feel like an open oasis in the midst of tiny, twisting lanes. We stayed tree nights, and the variety of staff who helped us, went out of their way to be gracious and accomodating. Our room was small but very clean and comfortable. We especially enjoyed the breakfasts out on the terrace: coissants, rolls, cheeses, spreads, jams, yogurt and pots of hot coffee and hot milk. We enjoy walking, and really liked the easy walks to the San Marcos square area and to the Riallto Bridge area. I think this is an important point, as it is easy to get turned around or lost while walking in Venice, esp. for the uninitiated. But, we never had this problem as these routes are easy to see on a map and to negotiate from this little hotel, and that is a real plus!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milan", "Title": "\u201cVery good value for money and excellent breakfast. Too bad for a couple of flaws.\u201d", "Author": "LR71", "ReviewID": "UR124608644", "Content": "If I had to mention just one thing about the Locanda Fiorita, it would be its value for money. We stayed there a couple of nights around Christmas, paying just \u00e2\u201a\u00ac51 per night for a double room (one of the small ones, called \"Classic\"). I guess it might cost more in other periods of the year, for instance during the Carnival, but to us it was a bargain, considering that the place is not bad at all. First of all, it is decent and clean. Secondly, the location is quiet and convenient, a 10-minute walk from Piazza San Marco and 3 minutes from the nearest \"vaporetto\" stop. (Too bad it is quite far from Santa Lucia railway station, but you can't be close to both Piazza San Marco and the railway station.) Besides, you will enjoy an excellent and abundant breakfast, with a wide variety of both sweet and savoury choices. Some days (both days, in our case) it is served in one of the two B&B's \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the Bloom and the Settimo Cielo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c run by the same owners and located in a nearby building. If you happen to have your breakfast there, take the opportunity to go up on the building's roof terrace overlooking the large Campo Santo Stefano and enjoy the scenic view. Despite the overall good impression, we found a couple of minor flaws too. A bad sewer smell came from the bathroom, though the bathroom was actually perfectly clean (besides being quite comfortable, by the way), but I guess Venice's canals are to blame for that more than the hotel. Keeping the bathroom door shut helped. We also temporarily moved a perfume diffuser from the corridor into our bathroom. After a while, we forgot the smell. Our second annoyance was the temperature in the room, definitely too high. The radiator was apparently oversized for our small room, which ended up being torrid although it was December and although we kept turning the radiator down. Finally, two other good points worth mentioning are the reservation process and the reception hours. Booking a room through the website is easy and straightforward. When you make your reservation, consider that the so-called \"Classic\" double rooms are very small. If you don't mind sleeping in a tiny bedroom, you can be content with a \"Classic\" room and save some money. On the contrary, if space matters to you and you are willing to pay a little more, you'd better choose a \"Comfort\" room. As for the opening hours, you can specify the approximate time of your arrival on the online reservation form and then you can check in even late at night, as the reception is open all night long, which cannot always be taken for granted in a hotel of this category.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cStill a great value and location\u201d", "Author": "rah373", "ReviewID": "UR121140276", "Content": "This was our second stay (May '08), and we are happy to report that the Fiorita continues to be a terrific value.

Locanda Fiorita could use renovation to its rooms and bathrooms, but for the money and the location its hard to beat. While initially this hotel seemed daunting to find (Venice is like a labyrinth), we did not encounter a problem finding the hotel. Be advised you will need to carry bags up and over a small bridge, but this is par for the course in that city. The hotel is located in a tiny, picturesque piazza smack in the middle of the San Marco quarter of the city (by far the most touristy), but far enough away from the main tourist drags that one develops a feel of what \"real\" Venice must be like. Access to the water taxi is quick and the main tourist sights (i.e. Piazza San Marco, The Rialto) are only a 5-10 minute walk, so the location is ideal. The hotel from the outside is very cute and is one of the prettier hotels in the city. They have free wifi access although the signal was poor in our room. Upon arrival we were given room #1 which unfortunately was on the first floor right outside the main entrance area where breakfast is served. We were not comfortable leaving our shutters open most of the time due to the fact that other guests could peer into our room at breakfast or even when they were walking up stairs to enter the hotel. This was not a major problem, however, due to the fact that when one is in Venice, one does not spend much time in a hotel. Our room was clean and had a modern little TV, but it looked like it could use some restoration work. The wallpaper was peeling and the bathroom was tiny and old. Also, the smell of fried fish permeated our bathroom due to it's location- perched above one of Venice's most authentic restaurants (which was not entirely bad- authentic Venetian cuisine is right around the corner). Breakfast is adequate and the staff is professional. Best of all, there's a 10% discount if you pay the hotel bill in cash. In short, Locanda Fiorita is an excellent budget option for Venice. I would recommend it, as you will spend enough money on food (or just about anything else) in Venice. If you book and don't require a four star ripoff, you will not be disappointed- just ask not to be in room #1 unless you like fried fish.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tinley Park, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Choice for Venice hotel\u201d", "Author": "JudyPIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR82439822", "Content": "I and 5 of my friends stayed in 3 rooms Sunday, October 3, 2010.

We weren't sure if the honeymoon package would turn out to be a waste of money, but it was AMAZING. That dinner alone was worth the money - we would have never splurged on such an expensive dinner if it hadn't been part of the package. We will remember that meal forever. We got the room with a separate entrance off the main courtyard (room 10); there is a little table with two chairs on the landing right next to the room and they served us breakfast there in private every morning. Every night we would come back and sit at that table with some wine and maybe pizza we bought elsewhere - it was quiet and private and oh-so-romantic. The room was decorated in old-fashioned Venetian style and it was much roomier than we had expected. The bed was comfortable. The breakfast was absolutely delicious (croissants, bread rolls, cheese, Nutella, jam, yogurt, etc...) - in fact every morning we had enough food to eat a full breakfast and pack up the rest of the rolls, cheese, etc for our lunch that day which saved us a lot of money.

To get from our room (#6) to the private bathroom, we had to walk past every other room on that floor AND the sliding door that opens to the lobby. Not very private. I guess we could have handled the lack of privacy while coming back from the shower, but it was made intolerable by the fact that the locks (which appeared to be about 50 years old) on our room and bathroom required about 10-20 seconds of jiggling before one could lock or unlock the darn door! The bathroom did have a thumb-turn lock on the inside, but our room didn't, so we had to use the key to lock our hotel room from the inside, which was not possible if one's spouse was using the key to go to the bathroom. We also made use of the hotel's wireless internet using our laptop. The front desk had a nifty security box that printed a unique username and password for guests to log on to their encrypted connection. The problem was that our username and password were only good for one hour at a time, so if we were on the internet for longer than an hour, we would get thrown off the wireless connection and had to walk to the front desk (after jiggling the key in our lock) in order to ask politely for a new username and password. I also had a lot of trouble uploading photos to Flickr over their wireless connection, despite having had no trouble at the hotel in Florence. I don't know if this was due to a slow connection or maybe somekind of firewall issue. Breakfast was good. Staff was nice. Our \"double\" bed was two twins pushed together. Small room, worn around the edges. I would not stay there again.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cAwesome location, charming room, great hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Italian-Adventure07", "ReviewID": "UR10168350", "Content": "We had a great stay at the Locanda Fiorita in Venice. Perfect location and our room was incredibly charming (we had number 10 with the balcony). Breakfast was served to us on our balcony. Some of the staff was a little bit unfriendly and at times rude, but other staff was helpful and nice. We got some bad advice regarding how to get to the airport from one guy (one of the owners we think) but thankfully the night staff person gave us an easier and much cheaper route! So the lesson there was to ask more than one person! We would highly recommend the hotel as it was clean, cute and in a great location in beautiful Venice! (Easy to get to by Vaporetto from the main train station. Just ask the hotel people for directions before you go).", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis, MO", "Title": "\u201cConvenient location\u201d", "Author": "JennyH78", "ReviewID": "UR10086436", "Content": "We stayed only two nights.

Venice is so incredibly expensive that anything under about $200/night is a great deal, so getting a room for $170 in the height of tourist season in July was pretty good. It is a cute little hotel a short walk from the water ferry stop in a quiet little square, not far from anything. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only slightly strange thing was the door to our room was behind the front desk, so getting in and out was a little weird, but I didn't mind at all. The room was decorated in traditional Venetian decor, with a large, comfortable bed. The air conditioning did not work very well though, so even when it was on full it only cooled off to about 77degrees F - a little warm for sleeping. The bathroom was fine, it could use a remodel but nothing was wrong and everything worked fine. Breakfast was okay, just some bread and coffee (great cappucino though), but be warned they end exactly at 10am. All in all, I think it was a great bargain hotel in Venice. I would stay there again if trying to save money, although I might consider spending a bit more to stay at a nicer hotel on the water if I can afford to in the future. Venice is amazing - definitely a place that must be visited!!! Although in the future I would avoid the summer because it is pretty hot and so busy. We couldn't even see over the Rialto bridge because there were so many people and the lines were too long to go into St. Mark's Basilica or the Doge's palace. Next time I'll go in the fall or winter.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Locanda Fiorita", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d284437-Reviews-Hotel_Locanda_Fiorita-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$132 - $251*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Campiello Novo - San Marco, 3457</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30124 </span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "284437", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/67/42/6742bf7e4deec558ae069f78da3af4fe1large.jpg"}}
