If you want to be in the centre of the El Raval or La Rambla this might not be for you. It's about a 20 minute metro ride from the main tourist hubs. You can be in Barcelonetta in about 30 and the camp nou in about 15. it is close to the airport however and a local bus stops right outside. For me, the location is a perfect way to avoid the scrum further central. Based at the end of one of the main metro lines, this hotel is a lovely slice of Catalan luxury.

Rooms are immaculate, there's no bath but the shower is amasing by far the best shower in a hotel I have ever had! Beds are two large singles pushed together so not overly romantic however comfy enough. We knew it was not in the city centre so were prepared for the metro, it is the last stop on the line and is at least 15 stops to catalunya by the rambles which we didn't know so as long as your prepared to travel it won't be a problem.

The restaurant in the hotel had terrible food and the service was really poor, not because it was slow but because our waiter was rude. There were 6 of us and all 6 were disappointed. I pulled back my sheets and saw some small bugs (the bed bug thing was going on and I was freaked out). We called down to the front desk for a change of sheets. When housekeeping brought us a new set - they were dirty or had stains on them. Our next effort was to call down and ask to change rooms. The put us in a new room, so we took our key card to the new floor. We opened the door to our new room to find someone else sleeping in there. I completed freaked out and no longer felt safe. That poor person must have been terrified too. The front desk was horrible in handling this situation - they were not helpful and were quite combative.

We booked the Duplex Suite and it was on the last floor of the hotel with breathtaking views over the city. The hotel room was great with two floors and a beautiful whirlpool in the sleeping room that gave stunning views over the city. Everything was perfect in the room. Also we did one evening room service. The food was good, not spectacular but worth the money. Breakfast was very good with a lot of choice and one plus there was Nespresso coffee with all the blends available.

The rooms have been described in detail by previous contributors,suffice to say very good.Maid service slipped up on a couple of occasions,left dirty glasses from the night before and did not change the towels when they clearly needed changing.

There is no where else to eat anywhere around this hotel,and having spent the days in the city centre,we did not feel inclined to get back on the Metro again to go out in the evening.The one time we did want eat in the hotel was New Years eve,to be told \"fully booked,but we can recommend restaurants in town\" The only alternative was room service which was very efficient and very good. The transport links to town are very good,Metro close by and takes 25 minutes to Pl Catalunya.We bought a T10 ticket which is good value at 9Euros.Also buses stop nearby,we took a trip to Sitges,nice scenery and this is a lovely little town.Takes about 40minutes on the bus.

The hotel lobby is beautiful and really felt five stars. Staff was helpful. We got a so called \"superior\" room which in my opinion, did not stand to that name. It was on the 14th floor so the view was nice, altough it would have been nicer from the other side of the building. Amenities and appliances were just ok for a five star hotel, and bedroom was reasonably well designed and luxuriously furnished, but not very roomy and the wardrobe was ridiculous. We got up very early and checked out. Apparently there is a free cofee and some pastries for those who leave very early before regular breakfast starts. We were \"unlucky\" as they had just retired the free coffee and regular breakfast did not start yet. After that, we picked up some daily press for free and got to the airport comfortably in the hotel shuttle, also for free. That was certainly good added value for the departure.

Reception staff were efficient during check in. There are 4 elevators and you have to select the floor you want to go to before the elevator arrives. This is at first a nice hi-tech touch, but becomes a real issue in a conference. The rooms are very nice. I was actually excited by the room, and that does not happen often :-) When you enter, you step into the closet/bathroom immediately. There is a door that leads to the bedroom. Bathroom is done in a black design with lots of mirrors, shower is good and the whole area is very spacious. Bed is comfortable and the room is functional. Breakfast is ok, although nothing to die for. Being used to the Hilton breakfast, I missed a few items. The breakfast room is very small (capacity maybe of 150?) compared to the large conference facilities. We were a group of 250 and it got packed just before the event started, so can't imagine anything over that. The lobby and conference facilities are done in a nice, modern design. Nothing to complain about there. But the group meals are mediocre. Also nearby the main conference room for I'd say 1600 pax, there is one set of bathrooms, the ladies with 5 stalls. That is completely insufficient if you're dealing with a bigger amount of people. The foyer of the main hall has a nice outside area where the coffee breaks extend. Now the elevators... When trying to get a group of less than 200 pax to their rooms to change for their afternoon activities, it becomes a nightmare. I can't imagine if everyone was going. There was a line of people from the lobby to the elevators, and we were waiting so long in the line that people who have got in their rooms first managed to get changed and return to the lobby before we were even half through the line. It took at least half an hour for all of us to reach our rooms, so the programs were delayed. This is caused by the elevator system as well as 4 elevators with capacity about 8 pax. Insufficient. As the breakfast restaurant is not on the lobby level, you are facing similar problems in the morning. The lobby bar is ok, again wasn't impressed but no complaints either.

So - what's the problem? Well.. The lifts have this very weird and not very responsive lift control which requires quite an in depth understanding of computer technology - I'm a techie myself but I do prefer a simple button the rooms have a slightly strange layout - you walk straight into an open plan dressing /bathroom area and through into the bedroom. For me I value the sanctuary of the porcelain and found it slightly unsettling - as did my wife. Plus the bathroom is lined with mirrors which present you with a panorama of you in all your glory.

The bar/restaurant and lobby are again furnished in a very avant garde fashion which I'm sure cost a fortune and represents the ne plus ultra, but the lighting is very subdued and I had a bit of difficulty working out whether the chairs and tables were in fact chairs and tables or art installations. So - amazing building - but we found it slightly unsettling - we also seemed to end up sharing the lift with the same French Sugardaddie trying to suck his babe's face off on every day of our stay. The location is typical inner suburbia and the metro station involves a 10 minute walk - we didn't manage to work out whether there was an airport or city centre shuttle or not, but there's always a couple of taxis close by - airport was about 20 euro/ 10 minute ride away", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in a beast of an area\u201d", "Author": "review169", "ReviewID": "UR122476953", "Content": "Tips: 1.

Nearest tube is 100m across the park. station called Bellvidge. 4. No kettle or iron in room 5. Gym, pool and jacuzzi is 12euro's per person per day 6. There is a 365 cafe,donner kerbab shop and bar around the corner 7. Hotel supplies you with: Toothbrush, toothpaste, sponge, soap, body moisturiser, shampoo, shower gel, tissues, slippers, shoe horn, sewing kit, shoe shine, razor, shaving cream, plenty of towels, matches ( new toiletries each day) 8. Don't waste money on meals out all the time- supermarkets are cheap for a picnic on the beach- baguette, salami, cheese, crisps and drink costs 7euros for 2 people! 9. The restaurants off side streets tend to be better e.g. marisc co 10. Water is expensive in Barcelona. In the hotel it is 7euros- the same as fine wine! 11. Visit the Gaudi work- it's spectacular! Good: hotel lift system very efficient! touch screen where you press your location before lift arrives. nicely decorated Electric curtains Sound proof rooms- don't hear anyone in thenext room clean hotel very attentive We got a free upgrade as we asked for a smokers room shower is fast! You get His and Her's sinks Comfy bed first night you are given a free bottle of water and tasty cakes Bad: Air-con in smoking room is bad- un-useful for myself when i don't smoke and my partner does restaurants expensive!!! Evo restaurant is \u00a3150 per person on normal night minus drinks!!! Bouguet is rubbish- food is minimal and the waitresses keep offering you bread and more drinks- won't leave you alone! Location- whilst we will travel for a better hotel, it's a very deprived area! be careful of pickpockets! I was warned several times Maids barged into our rooms when we was half naked without so much as a knock on the door!! this was in the late afternoon as they came to ask if our minibar needed stocking up! They tried to charge us for using the phone when we never used it. We both have our phones and apparently we dialled a house in barcelona's number when we don't know anyone in Barcelona.

It was a special celebration weekend for our daughters 18th. We booked two rooms and that night the shower leaked through to the toilet and flooded the bathroom area through the walls which also housed your wardrobe/suitcase and shoe area. We moved the following morning but it was a bit of a palarva as they said we would have to leave everything on the bed as the rooms were not ready and we wanted to go to the city. Then they telephoned and said that they were ready and someone was coming up, so it was all a bit of a rush. The hotel windows in the hallways also leak on to the shiny surfaces which become lethal and this happened on both floors we were on. The reception staff were lovely and helpful, the guys in the foyer called Lewis and Robert were really nice and helpful 5 stars to them!. The shuttle service we used twice and that was great too. The breakfast booked the night before at 15 euros each was a big disappointment. Thought the food would be fantastic and it wasnt. The toaster broke and my husband had chosen his breakfast and they said they would fix the toaster, when it worked they came over to tell us by which time my husbands breakfast was cold as he went to make toast, thought they would have brought the toast over in a 5 star if there toaster didnt work!! They said they would reheat it, something you are not supposed to do, we said no and he helped himself to another breakfast. The breakfast was very average for the price. Another couple had also eaten dinner there and they said the same for the price. service not amazing in this department compared to reception and lewis and Robert! There are no baths just power showers in some of the rooms. We got a secret room via lastminute and got a fair price so it was ok. We would return as it was quiet, comfortable and pleasant. The safe in the room is free as well. There are no kettles or irons and a cuppa cost you 4.50 euro,s! There is a great cafe with lovely locals behind the spa area next door, called 365 delicious coffee and croissants for 1.50 euros!! The supermarket is next door to that cafe and is excellent and there is a donner kebab shop and a little bar which we did not use. We jumped on a bus from the airport took 5 mins which was number 46 and got off at the Hopsital Oncologico andcrossed over to the hotel, 1 mins! the metro is only 5 mins 100 metres away and so easy and cheap to use. We bought the two day use certain buses and metro anywhere for 11 euros each for two days you can also buy a 10 trip for 8 euros or a one day or three day pass.

I had also booked this as the secret hotel option on an online booking site. The room was of a very high standard - it was also on the 18th floor so I had the most amazing view out over the city. Hotel goes up to floor 29. The room was really spacious and had all the amenities you would expect from a 5* hotel. There was also free wi-fi throughout the hotel - and it worked fine even on my elevated level :-) However, the wi-fi did go down one day - I called reception and they had someone come up and reset the router on my floor which fixed it right away (within 5 minutes it was up and running again) so if that happens and you need internet don't be afraid to say something. Gym was of an excellent standard - however if did cost an additional \u20ac12 for one day. It is attached to the hotel but I think it is a gym for common use because it is massive and has excellent facilities. Also a pool and spa so you can work out in the morning before breakfast and then have a jacuzzi at night before bed...if you want to get you full \u20ac12's worth :-) Breakfast was not included in my room - \u20ac24 a day or \u20ac15 a day if you pre-book. It was an excellent buffet for me - lots of fruit, cereals and yoghurty things - but the cooked stuff looked a bit manky...just like most hotel buffet's I guess. Also, like all the food in the hotel, it was still quite expensive for what you got. Coffee in the hotel reception was like\u20ac5 which is a lot. I think they have cottoned onto the fact that there are no restaurants/cafe's nearby so they have a captive audience. Anyway, this isn't anything out of ordinary from other hotels I have stayed at...just a bit annoying is all. Yes the hotel is in Hospital de Bellitge area so you need to take the metro if you plan on going into Barcelona but it is really so easy. It is the red line straight to the centre - anyway use this map http://www.tmb.cat/ca/detall-linia-metro/-/linia/L1 to navigate the subway lines.

We arrived by metro from the Barcelona train station. The trip is very easy to make, and as soon as you walk outside the metro station you'll see the hotel -- no worries about getting lost! When we checked in, the front desk clerk asked us if we wanted to upgrade for 60 Euros to a \"'duplex\" suite on the 25th floor. I didn't think it would be worth it, but my husband wanted to check out the room first, and after seeing it, we decided to upgrade. With the original Travelzoo deal I had found plus the upgrade we paid 130 euro per night. Our room was two stories and had a jacuzzi tub overlooking the industrial/shipyard complex of Barcelona. (Okay, so that doesn't sound too wonderful, but at night the lights twinkle and it's beautiful anyway!). I think we could also see the Segrada Familia from our room also. The downstairs had a nice sitting area with two chaise lounges and a huge TV, as well as a desk and a toilet, and upstairs was the bed, another huge tv, the jacuzzi tub, shower, and toilet. They had multiple kinds and sizes of bathrobes hanging in the closet, and the bath amenities were Bulgari. The room upgrade enabled us access to the Tower club lounge, which we used extensively. The Tower Club had tapas in the evening, along with bar snacks and pastries in the afternoon. There were drinks, including cava, wine, a variety of beers and liquors, coffee and tea. I think we got our money's worth in the upgrade on the Tower club alone. The room upgrade also allowed us to take the hotel's shuttle to Gava Beach, which was beautiful. Be prepared with lots of sunblock and money for a taxi if you go, though. The shuttle was a tight fit on the way back, and they only make two runs from the hotel in the morning, and two runs back from the beach in the afternoon. If you miss the return or get sunburned and want to leave early, you'll need about 50 euro to take a taxi, I think we were told. And breakfast was delicious! Almost anything you could want was there. There was so much fresh fruit -- including kiwi halves, orange, grapefruit and pineapple slices, whole strawberries, etc. Tons of cheeses, including soft goat cheeses with honey and nuts. There was a yogurt and granola bar with bowls of things like dried goji berries, macadamia nuts, and wheat germ to add in.

The location itself isn't attractive (rather industrial, view onto some port companies). Transportation: The hotel offers a shuttle to and from Barcelona airport, however, don't rely on a constant schedule. Best is to be in touch with the reception prior to your arrival and ask them to send you a time schedule in order for you to plan on rather taking a taxi, should you arrive after 11AM. Also, I recommend to order a taxi well in advance, should you have a very early flight home (which I had). It took the receptionist at least 15 min. to call me a taxi at 4AM.

The staff are very clearly aware of reduced rate customers, and make every effort to make plain their disgust when dealing with even the most meek and reasonable questions / requests. A particular highlight for us was having elevator doors more or less slammed in our face by a member of staff when we asked him to hold the lift as we were rushing to a wedding (reason for our stay). He didn't even bother to try and remotely disguise his lack of effort, and I'm sure I caught a glimpse of a smug sneer as the doors squeezed shut. Breakfast was also incredibly disappointing and nowhere near the supposedly \"5 star\" standard you would expect. Having now read other reviews, it seems obvious that they provide a substandard breakfast when reduced rate customers are staying. All the fruit was tinned, most of the cooked food was greasy and barely warm, there was a very limited selection of pastrys / bread etc with barley any jam or condiments available, and the coffee was very limited too. Any extras are incredibly expensive, and the spa / gym is not included despite how it may appear.

Funnily enough we didnt have breakfast in the hotel, and instead travelled into town and found a cafe each day for breakfast. As mentioned in previous reviews the hotel is about 30 min from the centre of Barcelona by Metro. The Metro is easy to use with an 'English' button on the ticket machine. Initially we purchased a '10 single journey' ticket, but for the last 2 days we purchased a 2 day ticket with unlmited travel on metro, funicular, train, including the train to the airport. The hotel is very expensive for drinks, food etc etc. As it is primarily a 'business' / 'conference' hotel - I can only presume people pay these prices and then claim them back on company expenses. If, we were to visit Barcelona again we would stay in a more centrally located hotel which included breakfast and the pool in the price.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Wales", "Title": "\u201cIt was a luxurious stay\u201d", "Author": "Travel-Artist1990", "ReviewID": "UR115368946", "Content": "Me and a friend stayed here for a 4 night city break.

It's not just outside of Barcelona town, but far enough that it costs 15 Euros in a taxi, which adds up to 60 Euros a day plus tips. The part of town it's in is horrendous - the views are of the slum tower blocks all around it and there's nothing nearby except a very deprived urban area. Cost: it's outrageous. No other word for it. The service and quality in no way go towards justifying the insane prices. 4.5 Euros for a tiny bottle of water, which we were obliged to drink because there are no shops nearby and unlike any other decent hotel, there was no complimentary bottled water for guests; or little details which would have given the illusion of it being a 5 star hotel, like good manners from the staff.

We arrived to find a surly receptionist who told us the room we had booked was not available, so we had the choice of either a twin broom with single beds, or a double smoking room. We foolishly took the double. It STUNK. But then there were no more rooms available. The receptionist, who minutes earlier pretended he couldn't speak English, was by this point engaged in a perfectly fluent English conversation about the football. Literally minutes later, he again pretended he couldn't speak English! If he hates customers so much, he's really chosen the wrong career, being in a customer-facing job and all.

Weird. I had booked this hotel as a place to relax before taking a flight home from Barcelona to New York after a great honeymoon week in Mallorca. I knew this place was an airport hotel and not in a sought after area, but there is litterally nothing there. Given this you would think the hotel would have a plethora of amenities. Not the case. When we entered the beautifull room we looked for a list of amenities such as pool, gym, restaurants, other activities etc. However there was nothing. I knew there was something strange with the the pool and gym in that you needed to pay to enter them, or if you were a hotel guest you could enter for free, but I was not sure. Unfortunately there was no information in the room to supply any information about anything. I went down to the front desk and asked if they had any information about what the hotel had to offer, she replied with yes you should have a small black pamphlet with all of the information you need. I informed her that I did not believe my room had this pamplet, she then went on to pretty much tell me - oh well, and I am not going to give you another one. Really?? She told me to look at the elevator map if I had questions. I then went back to the room and called guest services and asked \"is there a pool and gym in the hotel?\" her response \"yes of course there is a pool/gym in the hotel\", my response \"where?\" her response, \"in the hotel\" (thanks for being utterly useless and sarcastic), my response once again \"where in the hotel?\" her response \"in the back of the first floor\". My wife and I then put on our bathing costumes and flip flops and trudged through the ornate lobby where everyone is wearing suits and see zero signage for the pool. I then continue through the lobby down the hallway and now I am in a private party (uncomftorable), we then travel through the party and approach a turnstile which instructs us to buzz for hotel gym access, which we do and are buzzed in accordingly. We walk through a bustling gym (still no pool), we ask a staff member where the pool is and we are directed through another turnstile to speak to the front desk who inform us that we just need to tell them we are hotel guests and we will receive a towel for pool use. After standing there for a half hour as the only staff member worked with someone with member service questions we are then told we need to buy a token at the hotel for 12 euro and that we cannot go back to the hotel the way we came and need to go outside through a parking lot and then walk through a grassy knoll (are you serious?) We then approach the hotel and are greeted by a concerned and very helpfull hotel staff member. I tell him of my concerns and he first tells me that in Barcelona you cannot expect pool and gym access at a 5 star hotel, as that is 4 star hotel amenities (weird), I asked about the restaurants (3) that are offered, ie what cuisines are served, what are the hours, do I need reservations, what is the dress code etc (as no info is provided anywhere). He helps me with all of my questions and apologizes for the lack of information. All of this could have been avoided if they provided any information in the room. I guess they are too chic for that though. If this level of service works for you then this hotel is for you.

Sadly, the lady on reception who elbowed her colleague out the way to book us in subjected us to a twenty minute upselling tirade until I had to forcibly tell her to stop. What a terrible start! I fully understand that as we booked this five star hotel via Expedia at a very competitive rate that the hotel would want to sell us more profitable services \u2013 no problem there, we were actually willing but it was such an aggressive pitch I almost expected a time share viewing to be arranged. Unfortunately it had the opposite effect and we were just keen to get away from the aggressive reception manager and into our room to escape. Despite our prolonged encounter at reception we had no idea of the services available at the hotel nor felt very welcome and actually had intended to upgrade our room but felt unwilling to give in to the relentless upsell. So, we discretely re-entered the reception and dealt with a more friendly colleague who charmingly upgraded our room for an extra seventy five Euros per night to a suite. Sadly the suite wasn\u2019t great so for a further twenty five Euros per night we upgraded to a duplex suite with excellent views of Barcelona which was more than worth the upgrade. The upgrade included entrance to the excellent spa, breakfast and access to an exclusive fifth floor lounge with tapas provided by Santi Santamaria, Catalan wines, Bang and Olufson entertainment centres, private meeting rooms, full office facilities, more snacks, nibbles, beer, champagne, and too much to list. It is quite simply the best and most generous upgrade offer we have ever enjoyed. So, with equanimity restored we booked a table at Evo again and tucked into the tasting menu. Although tragically the late Santi has passed all too early the standard of cooking has not waned and his reputation is upheld. The food is stunning, the service charming and great value. Lastly, yes \u2013 this hotel is a little out of town but a five day metro pass costs around forty five Euros and the metro station stops in the hotel car park and is the most efficient way to get around Barcelona.

Very Polite receptionists very helpful as we had two rooms booked and we were early, and check in was not till 1500. Since I had been emailing them they had sorted one room out for us so we could leave a luggage and freshen up before we went out. Rooms are excellent as we had two connecting rooms, good views especially in the night (we were on the 15th floor). Rooms have a mini bar which is expensive and use of bathrobes and towels so no need to take any, also free showers/wash stuff. Breakfast is expensive around 20 euro's each so if you go out the main entrance and turn right towards Media Mrkt and the right again pass the water pond and keep walking (5 mins) across the road there is local shops like a supermarket for water and general stuff and a small cafe called 365 which was great for breakfast. You can get coffee and fresh orange juice and breakfast like toasted sandwich and crossant type things (cash only places though) but its cheaper than most places. Hotels does a free shuttle to Las Ramblas which takes around 10 - 15 with out traffic so not bad, but don't leave it till the time it leaves to catch it otherwise you may not get on as it only takes around 16 people. Don't worry as the metro is not far which will take a 20 min ride to Catalayn which is near Las Ramblas. Had a lovely stay and would stay here again if I get the same deal.

Despite worrying when we arrived that the hotel is on a noisy roundabout, inside the hotel, you can't hear the traffic. The reception is very impressive with an art deco feel. Staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a standard room, which was smaller than we expected, but very clean. Bathroom was spectacular with a great shower! The location isn't too bad, we were aware that it was a little bit out of the town, but there was a regular bus service into town, which the hotel provide for free. Otherwise we would use the subway, which was as short walk away. Average journey into the centre of the town was about 1/2hour.

Same shuttle service runs into town and drops you off at the main plaza, which takes about 15 minutes. We weren't aware that places were limited on this and on Sunday, the people behind us weren't allowed on! So get to reception 10 minutes early & stand outside to guarantee yourself a place. The room was just stunning, especially the dressing/bath room, which is as one, with black marble type walls/floors and mirrors. Lovely toiletries, replenished every day. King size bed very comfy, electronic curtains with floor to ceiling window (ask for city view, as other side of hotel has poor view). Free wi-fi - ask for the code at reception. iPod dock (which also charges iphone) in room. Hotel reception very helpful as were all staff. Breakfast has good selection, pre book at reception to save yourself 6 euros - you'll get it for 18 rather than 24. Pool/gym etc is in adjoining building and you pay per day to use it. We didn't have time, sadly. The lobby is super trendy but functional and the low level loungers are a great place to read or wait for transport. Cracking hotel, highly recommended. The metro red line is approx 3 mins walk from hotel and from here it is approx 25/30 mins on tube to main plaza (Catalunya). Tickets are 1.45 euros per trip. Much bigger carriages than in London, felt safe and was clean. As stated, hotel is appox 15 mins from main town centre and there didn't appear to be much going on locally. We didn't find this a problem, as we took advantage of free shuttle, used the metro and when we did come home late in a taxi, it was only about 15 euros. Our town experiences: Barcelona City Tour (red bus) was great. Paid 30 euros each for 2 days. There are other buses operating, but they seemed to have huge queues (Turistic). Hop-on, hop off. Be aware if you get off at Gaudi's Park Guell, there is a 10 minutes walk, up steep hill from the bus stop. Las Ramblas is great and full of atmosphere with it's quirky street entertainers. However, the quality of food at the cafes is poor and over priced - just take yourselves off the main street and you will find plenty of better places, like Del Pi bar in Santa Maria del Pi plaza. The highlight of our gastronomique experience in Barcelona was in The Boqueria market (closed Sundays). Just through the entrance is a stall called Bar Pinoxto (pinocchio). We sat at the 'bar', drank local cava. We asked one of the staff for a menu, he replied \"I AM the menu!\" We spent the next hour looking at fabulous things and pointing and tasting! The chickpeas with black pudding was amazing, as were the scrambled eggs with spring onions and asparagus. They are tapas sized portions, so you can try lots of different things! The shuttle bus drops you off outside a bar, which does great cocktails and limited tapas - it's a good starting point to have a cocktail and plan your evening. Had an interesting meal at 'Cheese Me' which is located just off the Via Laitana and great wine. Beware most cafes on the Ramblas serve sangria in very large wine glasses, approx 0.5 litres each, which cost about 14 euros and are a bit ridiculous unless you are sharing!!!

Good points: excellent rooms, (even the 'standard' ones are fully equipped), massive comfortable bed, bath robes, slippers, tv (even found BBC programmes), free wifi, minibar, safe etc. powered curtains (we didn't bother with these as it was a great view over the city from our floor). Bathrooms had all toiletries supplied, wonderful shower systems, his & her sinks etc. all in black marble & mirrored - totally impractical but very classy. Bad points: location, as many have mentioned, though there is a free minibus that takes you into Barcelona if you want - can probably bring you back as well but we never managed to find them for the return journey - I think later in the day they do airport runs etc. so a bit haphazard. Taxi to city centre is 10euros (from the airport it was 15euros). Even though the hotel is right next to a major road (the one between city & airport) traffic noise was well insulated, though being on the 18th floor may have assisted as well - talking of which lifts are very fast and easy to use once the system is explained (though you can just wait for one and then press buttons as normal). Room keys are cards and the first set didn't work which was slightly annoying, but soon sorted out. The other big negative is the cost of everything. I know this is 5 star, but 24 euros for a fairly standard buffet breakfast, even though there was an excellent choice, is very steep. Not even tea/coffee facilities in the room - room service is 24 hour but tea & coffee are 4.5 euros so still pricey (although Barcelona city itself is very expensive un;less you seek out the areas away from the Ramblas etc.). We opted for the 17 euro breakfast offer (if ordered when booking in) for one morning, just to try it, but after that took a 5 minute walk to a local cafe that did excellent croissants & coffee. Talking of which at the rear of the hotel are massive blocks of flats that stretch as far as the eye can see - walking around them is a bit depressing, all concrete jungles etc., but the locals are very friendly - make an effort to speak Spanish and you will be rewarded. Also shops are very much cheaper than in the city. Other points: The hotel adjoins a large health/sports club where the offered facilities are available, all extras of course. The very large reception has loads of seating, all very modern but none of it suitable for sitting on - I guess it's to stop people hanging around & making the place untidy! The final nail in the coffin was that this is definitely a business hotel (probably how they survive and why they charge exorbitant prices). The whole place was taken over by promotional stuff from a large electrical manufacturer, and on our 2nd day it was over-run by the suited brigade with laptops & blackberrys everywhere - not a very peaceful time from then on, luckily we were out for most of the day & the bar was too pricey even if we could get to it.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, OK location.\u201d", "Author": "rustymagoo", "ReviewID": "UR101624575", "Content": "We booked this Hotel through lastminute.com as part of their \"secret hotel\" and got a good rate on room only basis.

Incredibly modern and sleek, but I imagine it might not be to everyone's tastes. I was very pleased with the room, It was very clean and huge, especially as it was just me in it. The room also came with an ipod dock, hair dryer and straightners, dressing down, free safe deposit box and fridge. The shower was also great. There's also a tv but I didn't use it.

I'd also recommend buying bottled water before checking in as the stuff in the room was extorionate and the water out of the tap disgusting. Prices in the hotel generally were pretty steep (5euro for a cappuchino) but I didn't eat or drink in the hotel very much. The spa attached is not for exclusive use of the hotel. I found using it pretty stressful (not what you want from a spa) as the girl at reception was just frankly rude and I after going to the spa knowing I had to pay 12euros, I was told I had to go back to the hotel to pay there and then come back with a coin. Why this was necessary, I couldn't tell you!

Good points The location is ideal for the airport as it is near the first bus stop inside the city, so arriving on an evening flight was no problem. The hotel is also next to the Hospital de Bellvitge metro station, which is a direct route into the city but has15 stops (count them !) and took 30 to 45 minutes to reach central Barcelona. If you are happy to get the metro or bus into the city in the morning and return in the evening this hotel is ideal. Hotel staff were really friendly and helped me enjoy my stay. The breakfasts were divine - make sure they are included in the cost of the stay. 5 courses filled me up for a day of sightseeing until evening meal most days. I had no problem with noise from other hotel rooms. The view of Barcelona is fantastic, particularly when arriving at night. Bad points Don't book this hotel if you want to be near the sights, or the beach, or if you want somewhere that is easy to return to during the day, or as a base to enjoy Barcelona's nightlife. It's primarily a business hotel. Next door is a big shop selling electrical goods e.g. cameras and memory cards, but other than that I didn't find anywhere nearby selling food. English language TV is pretty much limited to news channels. If you speak Spanish, there are more. The lady on Reception said this was the same throughout hotels in Barcelona due to their only being one TV transmitter for the whole of Barcelona. The swimming pool is located next door in what seemed to be a separate sports centre. As well as a costume and goggles, you also have to buy a swimming cap and flip flops for the pool and pay 12 euros per day to use the facilities. It didn't seem like hotel residents were getting a better deal than the locals. There wasn't any literature at hotel reception saying what to do or where to go. After working it all out, it felt like their were just too many obstacles to having an early or late dip in the pool, so reluctantly I gave swimming a miss. There isn't much to do in the evenings except read the FT, watch news and plan tomorrow's itinerary. Internet access requires an internet capable device - don't expect a computer terminal in your room like I did. I had a few minor problems but nothing that spoiled an excellent holiday. One last thing I had been put off traveling to Barcelona for years because of its bad reputation for pickpocketing. One of the first things I heard in English over the loudspeakers in the metro and at the beach were warnings to look out for distractions and to look after your belongings but after taking sensible precautions I didn't see or encounter any problems at all.

It is located outside of the centre, but 2-3 mins walk from a Metro stop, and it took approx 20mins on the Metro to get right in the centre near La Rambla. This was fine for us, as we had no issues using the Metro and for those of you who've never used it before, out of all the undergrounds I've used outside the UK I found this easy to use - very similar set up to London. The staff were all helpful and pleasant. We did not have breakfast booked and for the price I would recommend ordering a la carte and having it delivered to your room.....we both got poached eggs on toast, a pot of tea and pot of coffee for the cost of 1 person's continental breakfast in the restaurant. We ate in the downstairs bar one night and the food was lovely, however if you're after a cheap holiday then this hotel isn't for you! The cost of some starters were around 11-15 euros and most drinks were 11 euros. We did want to eat in the restaurant on the top floor as it looked amazing. We enquired at reception and looked at the menus - 2 to choose from, 1 around 90euro per person and the other about 140euro per person but we were very disappointed with the choices - it was a set menu and if you don't like fish or seafood then it's not for you. This was a real shame as we were really looking forward to eating there. The rooms were very modern and clean and we had a gorgeous view from our window. The room wasn't particularly big, but we'd got 2 single beds (pushed together) a small sofa and dressing table. The layout of the room was quite unusual - as you enter the room you're immediately in the bathroom with a wardrobe and then a door leading to a toilet and another door leading to the shower. The only down-side to this hotel was lack of atmosphere. I don't know if it's because of the time of year we travelled but there was hardly anyone in the bar area so not much atmosphere.

Towers is recessed enough from the freeway that you don't get a lot of traffice noise either. There are no major bustling tourist centers or shops nearby that you would walk to and you can't really see into the \"downtown\" area. You are also not enclosed in by a lot of tightly packed buildings, so you do get a view of the general open landscape. Instead, be prepared to take the underground subway to Las Ramblas to get your tourist groove on (10-15? miles to the downtown area or about a 9 stop or 20-25 minute ride). The subway is easy to ride, but make sure you ask the hotel receptionist how to locate it from the front lobby. I'd say that it is about 600 yards off the front of the hotel entrance and is not really marked with clear signage. It is essentially a stairway leading underground to where you can purchase tickets from an ATM machine (~$5 euro per person for a 24 hour pass). You can also easily get to the pier by taking a taxi, which will run somewhere in the neighborhood of $25-30 euro and take about 20 minutes. I would not really recommend hopping on the subway to get to the downtown area with all your luggage (unless you are traveling really light) and then trying to catch a taxi to the pier which would be relatively close. The reason is that it is simply too much to try and lug 600 yards to the entrance and then around on a subway train and back up to the street level. It can be done, but I wouldn't really recommend it. When you enter the Towers, you will get the feeling of the modern element of the design architecture and that theme will continue as you take the elevators and walk into your room. I'd describe the hotel as \"clean\" but not necessarily \"new\" feeling. Maintanence on the property is reasonable and you shouldn't be disappointed by the amenities. The showerin the rooms is pretty nice, if you are into that kind of thing. There is a 3 star Michelin restaurant that sits at the top of the towers but you need a reservation in advance to eat there (cost is minimum of $100 euro per person). When we went to just take a look, there wasn't anyone there but they still insisted that you have a reservation if that gives you an idea of the 'atmosphere' there. Oh yeah, and no pictures please! This isn't to say that the staff isn't friendly or helpful when asked for help. On the other hand, I didn't notice that they went out of their way to make you feel welcome or find out what they could do to make your stay a more pleasant or memorable one. This is a hotel that you would want to stay at if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas and can catch a deal to save some money. I'd stay there again if it were just a quick stop through. If you were going to stay a bit longer, you can probably find a better place closer to the downtown area.

Stay somewhere closer.\u201d", "Author": "PhilAlan", "ReviewID": "UR79931919", "Content": "We've been to Barcelona before, so felt we could manage being further 'from the action' for this trip. The Hesperia seemed to fit the bill at 5* on a discount offer. We drove to Barcelona, so the first problem we faced was finding the hotel. Our newish Tom-Tom had no record of either the address or the hotel! We did have a choice of 2 Gran Via, be sure to select Gran Via des corts Catalanes or you will end up in the middle of town, probably during rush hour (like us). Upon arrival we discovered that parking at the Hotel was 24 Euro a day, excessive for so far out of the city. The next was that the hotel staff didn't volunteer any helpful information at all! Very odd as all our other stays in the area had very helpful staff. The Hotel lobby is very open, with low rectangular blocks of furniture pushed together to resemble seating, It didn't give the best of first impressions. Certainly not a 5* impression. The elevators are somewhat 'clever', partially sighted or less alert?, beware. Entering the room from the landing corridor we found ourself straight into the bathroom, very unusual, it reminded me of the hall of mirrors from old fairgrounds. The bathroom had an excellent shower (that unfortunately leaked through the wall and onto the toilet floor (and obviously had done so for a while.) The bed was large and comfortable. The rest of the decor was a dark wood finish, not really 5 star in our opinion. The room seemed clean, but when we moved the settee it was obvious it hadn't been cleaned underneath for a while. (I did find a 'free' battery though!) We were on the 21st floor and hoped for great views, instead we had a view of a housing estate, a major road and a commercial area, hardly inspiring, but your room may do better. The hotel wasn't busy and as result was very quiet, the comfy bed meant we slept well. The swimming pool was operated seperately with a 12 euro charge. We felt it was misleading to not make the point on the hotel website. Getting into Barcelona is a 3 minute walk to the underground station Directly in front of the hotel entrance, (but not visible from there). It's the L1 Line, colour coded, red. and a 30 minute journey to Catalunya (at the top of Les Rambles). The trains were very efficient, frequent and clean, cost per journey was a very reasonable 1.2 Euro.) The hotel was very good value on the special offer price we had (65 euro per day, I think), and we were generally happy there, but I'd advise new visitors to Barcelona to pay a bit more and try and stay within the tourist area of the city, the Hesperia tower was hardly 'convenient. A tip for the frugal, beware of having breakfast and dinner at the Hotel, the prices could easily multiply the cost of your stay! There are a couple of cafe's and a supermarket nearby on the housing estate (turn right at the hotel entrance, then right again, then left (you will see them). We did experience the minimally helpful staff upon arrival (which was a big surprise in a 5* hotel), but later we asked another person for advice and he was very helpful. In brief, the hotel served us well, with excellent, quirky quality at the offer price we paid, but it was not very conveniently located. I did object to paying 24 euro a night for parking so far from the city though. It would have been nice to have ate there, but frankly the prices were excessive. Wi-Fi was available in the room for free, but you need your own laptop, otherwise it's 5 euro for 15 minutes!! or 12 euro per hour in the lobby.

This was a dream come true....brilliant hotel...very clean...very modern....very spacious room and fab shower...and what a fantastic view.....high up on the 16th floor....wow..... We read the reviews of this hotel and were pleased with the rating for this hotel. The following are some tips: The metro is only 2minutes away from the hotel on foot.....Brilliant! Buy the ticket that says 10 dia...i think. worth it...you can use it for metro and bus too. There is a free shuttle service from the hotel to Placa Catalunja at 10.30 am and two other different times...just be infront of the hotel entrance ten minutes before just to make sure you find a place on the van since it only takes around 12 people. When you go out of the hotel turn to the right ....walk and turn right again...there is a coffee shop.....bread etc. Just to let you know there are no coffee and tea appliances in the room.....mini bar is not free and we had no iron board inside the room. There is nothing much next to the hotel just a hospital....very quiet....for us this was perfect since after a whole day out we wanted peace and quiet. It only takes 3O MINUTES TO ARRIVE TO PLACA CATULJANA...and i calculated the time with the shuttle bus and this took the same time....believe me the time will pass so so quickly. We travelled with Ryanair from Malta to Girona...as soon as you get out of the airport there is one bus waiting to take you to an area in barcelona- free of charge...time taken ...2hours.....pleasant drive...once you arrive at the end of the drive either take a taxi ...only 12-15 euro or take the metro which is right opposite this bus terminus which will take you to Hesperia hotel.If you hire a car you can park it opposite the hotel on the left hand side instead of paying 20 euro a day for the hotel private parking. Gold Car are the best to hire a car....So so cheap.

The hotel is only a short distance from the airport, we had to get a taxi to the hotel (their shuttle bus last dropped off /picked up at 9am at the airport). We wasted quite a bit of time trying to find the correct bus to take us to the hotel and eventually got a taxi. The taxi driver didn't really know where the hotel was and it cost about 25 euros which was a lot considering it isn't that far from the airport to the hotel. When we arrived at about 12.30pm we were greeted by reception staff who were quite friendly. We were told after going through all the stages of check in (passport details, credit cards, names confirmations etc etc) that there weren't any rooms available. We asked whether we should come back to check in at 3pm and were told 'maybe' and that it would be better if we came back later than 3pm. We could however leave our bags in a secure room and they kindly gave us a map and pointed out the best attractions and routes around the city. The metro line L1 (red) which terminates pretty much outside the hotel at Hospital De Bellvitage is being repaired for the last three stops at the moment, but there is a free bus services on the other side of the roundabout (which is directly outside the front of the hotel) which will take you to the nearest metro station Av Carrilet. It takes about 5 minutes to the metro on the bus and then from there its 1.40 euros each and about 15 minutes to the Catalunya stop (which is at the top of Las Ramblas). The metro is clean and wasn't really busy when we used it, however you have to be very careful of pickpockets and we were advised to not be left alone in a carriage as we know people who have had money taken in a situation like that. Having said that, we had no problems and could normally find a seat for the journey. We spent a great afternoon on Las Ramblas and eventually got back to hotel at about 5.30pm. We checked in easily and were given a very nice room on the 23rd floor (an exec room not a deluxe like we booked, score!). The lifts are very quick and quiet and we liked the touch screen podium to control the lift . Our room was simply amazing. The view was unbelievable, we looked out over the city and could see the Sagrada Familia (It was about the size of your thumb nail but it was there!), Mt Tibidabo, the Olympic Stadium area, the marina and much more. I can honestly say that the view we had completely made up for the distance you had to travel on the metro. Having said that, if we were on a lower floor or on the other side of the hotel we may not have been quite so pleased looking toward the airport, but I don\u2019t know. The room had its own dressing area / bathroom. The shower was amazing after a long hot day walking. The room itself was large, clean and we had a kingsize bed which was quite firm, but not as rock solid as the Premier Inn at Manchester Airport on the way there! We had a mini bar that was fully stocked but over-priced, as you would expect in such a hotel. We didn't eat in the hotel because of the price however there is a little street of shops and cafes and mini supermarkets nearby were we stocked up on breakfasts food and drinks. When you come out of the hotel walk past the media market and turn right walking towards a little church, before you get there the shops are just on the left hand side. We went at about 7pm on a Friday night and there were still some shops open and we were able to get all sorts from there at really cheap prices, well worth stocking up there before a day in the city centre with its inflated prices. We checked out on Monday morning about 7.45 am to get the shuttle bus to the airport at 8.20 am. We were told we had a charge for our room of 4.50 Euros and did we use the mini bar etc which we hadn\u2019t and the receptionist wiped the bill quickly without fuss. The shuttle bus is quite small and can only fit about 12 people on it, it is about 10 minutes from the hotel to the airport, however he dropped us and everyone else off at Terminal one and we had to make our own way to Terminal 2 (Ground Floor t1 \u2013 t2 airport shuttle bus which is free or by taxi) which was another 5 -10 minutes. Overall the hotel was lovely, clean and modern and although it was pretty full it still felt spacious. The staff where quite friendly and most could speak English quite fluently.

The hotel itself is pretty nice - from the outside it's not particularly pretty, but the standard of the interiors and the view are both impressive. I found the staff to be pleasant though you have to ask if you require something as they're not ones to volunteer information (the wi-fi, which is free and has good signal strength throughout, is passworded, and you need to get a password from reception, which they didn't inform me of at check in). All the staff I dealt with spoke excellent English, and I also heard one of them speak French fluently. The location might be an issue for some people but if you're like me and leave the hotel all day to explore, coming back in the evening, it's not a problem. If you want to be close to the centre of Barcelona and come and go as you please, or return late at night after the metro has stopped, this hotel won't suit you! At the time of writing until (from what I could gather with my limited Spanish) September the metro isn't running as far as the hotel but there is a replacement bus service from the current final stop on Line 1, Av. Carrilet, which is well-signposted, free, and leaves from virtually outside the hotel (the normal metro stop is a few minutes' walk across the hospital car park). The metro takes 20 mins or so to reach central Barcelona and the trains are air-conditioned, clean and cheap so not a hardship. I can see taxis being fairly expensive as it's a bit of a distance to the centre, and I found no information about the shuttle bus anywhere (I guess you have to ask but I wasn't planning on using it). If you're not happy with the prospect of using public transport to get around, I would stay somewhere else. The rooms as noted are beautifully furnished, of a good size, and the beds are comfortable - well up to 5* standard. The bathroom was especially impressive and luxurious. However the quirks of the hotel (the lack of proactive service, the weird lift system, the location, and other minor niggles) mean that I can see why some people have been disappointed - if I had paid the standard price, especially for one of the more expensive rooms, I think I would have found it more irritating. The hotel is billed as 5* but in my opinion it's more like a high-end 4* hotel, albeit with 5* quality rooms - perhaps this is where some people's expectations are being dashed (it isn't the same quality as the well-known luxury 5* hotels - but then it doesn't cost nearly as much as those!). But if you can get a good deal - and this is a business hotel so the summer is basically off-season for them, so they seem to do a lot of offers around this time - and manage your expectations and don't mind a bit of travel into the centre then I think you will be more than happy.

Hesperia Tower is an amazing new concept located about 15 minutes drive from the airport in an area called Hospitalet Lobrigat (Given it's close proximity to a major cancer care hospital) about 15 minutes drive from the centre of Barcelona. The hotel features a Metropolitan Gym (12\u20ac per day), Full size Convention Centre and 3 main, suitably large restaurants; Bouquet, Azimut and Evo (Albeit I couldn't so much as look at the Evo as the floor was closed for the entire month for construction work I believe) there are 2 bars one annexed to the Bouquet restaurant the other behind reception. A very impressive Tower Club conference centre featuring glass walled meeting rooms are also on offer. The Hotel security/concierge do and excellent job given the amount of pickpockets and petty criminals that prey on opportunity in the city; suffice to say if someone says you have chewing gum/bird poo on your back/butt put up with it and walk on! On the whole my stay at this hotel was very good but the wind was taken out of my sails by lack of enthusiasm on the part of the staff and an initial mix up with my booking: I had booked an Executive Double/Luxury Double but was assigned a twin. After a minor furore with the receptionist she 'upgraded' me. More demanding guests would not tolerate error and then questioning from a 5 star establishment. A taxi from the airport costs 20\u20ac minimum and a taxi back from Plaza Catalo\u00f1a should cost no more than 14\u20ac airport or Plaza Catalonia takes about 15 minutes each way (I got stuck in traffic coming from PC and it came to just 10.40\u20ac) There are regular shuttles to the city beach and to/from the airport, but if you arrive after 8pm you have to take a taxi to the hotel as there is no shuttle service after this time. The last afternoon shuttle to the town (Plaza Catalo\u00f1ia) leaves at 12:20 then resumes in the evening from around 6pm. The lifts which service the hotel rooms are probably the fastest, most efficient I have ever encountered but with more than 27 floors to serve they need to be. A total of 4 lifts service the rooms via a snazzy little Star Trek style podium which requires a heavy handed push of the on screen buttons, as one of the security/concierge pointed out with timely assistance, multi touch has yet to make its way to elevator technology! It should be noted that the lifts are air conditioned and on the first visit to my room the AC in my lift was dripping on me. Again not a nice first impression! I was lucky enough to get this hotel as part of a mystery package on lastminute.com and I was not disappointed. The views from my hotel room were simply remarkable the hotel is owned by NH Hoteles and part of their luxury Hesperia arm. The fit and finish to the room was really quite impressive albeit the on demand TV/Film service was not working (I had to put up with CNBC my entire stay yet again) The Calla lilies in my room and bathroom died on arrival (nothing to do with me I hope) and were never replaced or even removed (slightly depressing for a first impression). The fit of the bathroom come dressing room come hall was really very impressive. Mahogany wardrobes with individual cupboard spaces reminiscent of an episode of Jeeves & Wooster. With space for everything from socks to sandals and underpants to uniforms and more mirrors than, well a hall of mirrors I suppose! NH's made a wise decision to pipe the TV audio into the bathroom's ceiling mounted JBL speaker system. This allowed me to keep track of my stocks whilst draining the lizard! The internet connection in the rooms was all but non existent, I had to take my Macbook Pro to reception in order to connect. Look closely at the finish of the rooms and details such as the condition of the chairs in the reception lounge you'll notice something... It was finished in a hurry and there's a general lack of attention to detail. Although this hotel is practically complete snagging has not seen a true completion of this hotel and it was still being snagged while I was there. Room service was prompt and courteously delivered by a handsome chap who looked wide awake despite the fact that it was well after 1am. The food however let the side down. I decided on my return to London I visited my local Wetherspoons (Southfields!) for a Beer and Burger combo to compare and contrast. The quality of the \u00a34.85 Wetherspoons burger which includes a free pint of beer was 10 times better than the 23\u20ac Hesperia room service cheese burger despite the dinky bottles of Sherry Vinegar and Olive oil which were provided. This might be down to the fact that Wetherspoons do an excellent burger for the money or that Hesperia simply charge far too much for the basics... The buffet food in the Bouquet restaurant again left much to be desired for the price 22\u20ac per person including soft drinks. I especially liked the limitless supply of Serrano ham. Food was good but for the price should have been considerably better. Buffet Breakfast served in the Azimut restaurant was yet again unimpressive for the price 18\u20ac per person. Service was virtually non existent and staff seemed more intent in getting me to sign for the addition to the room bill than my overall enjoyment of the experience. I purposely sat at an unset table used by a previous guest and no attempt was made to clear it or offer cutlery. Everything from coffee to sugar you have to go and get for yourself. This is where true 5 star hotels like Crowne Plaza, Hilton and Ritz Carlton along with their humble dedicated teams stand head and shoulders above Hesperia Tower despite its height and modern features. And finally to the bar...Some might say that alcohol clouds your judgement but credit where credit is due. The barman at the Hesperia's reception bar could teach the management and staff a thing or two! First off he offered more information about the hotel and Barcelona in general than anyone else during my entire stay. Further I text my wife to call me and ask to be put through to me at the bar. I even sat next to the bar phone which was sitting on the bar less than an arm's length away. The receptionist asks the barman if she can put a call through and he tells her how to do it in language even I can understand. So what does she do? She makes me walk across to reception and take the call in reception...that's just lazy! Further credit to the barman, he makes probably the best Caipirinha I've ever had. This is probably because he uses his own secret sugar blend, real Cacha\u00e7a and the freshest sun ripened limes.

Nice design does not compensate the negative part - poor service. We arrived with the night flight and showed up in the hotel at 7:30 in the morning. As being a member of nh-hotel (Hesperia is the one from the chain) I can ask for the early check-in so I did in advance informing the hotel, in the morning I was given a room on the 7th floor very dirty and not prepared for the guests: apart from the dust which was everywhere I found the dirty socks in the bedside table also there were no toilet amenities at all except for that attached to the wall in the shower with some kind of soap. I claimed, so instead of changing the room we were visited by the hotel attendant who checked the socks and invited the room service manager ( arrived accompanied by 3 persons when my husband was already in bed) who took the socks out saying there were no other rooms available to change at that morning. As we were tried from the night flight we decided to stay, but when we left for the city visit we descovered the room was not cleaned even after.. So, my reccomendation would be to book a hotel either right at the aiport if you are travelling with an overnight stay in Barcelona, or to stay in the city center because they charge you the same amount anyway for the taxi transfer which is apx. 25-30 euro. We booked a hotel right in the heart of the shopping street on Gracia. The hotel name is Eurostars Bcn Design, which is opposite Mandarin Oriental. The hotel has very interesting design also the open terrace on the roof with a wirlpool and sunbeds and its right in the city center! You can check my report on this hotel with the relevant pictures.

The black and silver decor was also very nice and there were plenty of comforts such as a dressing gown, slippers and body products. The lobby area and bar was also beautifully decorated and a lovely place to relax in with a glass of wine, after a long day of sightseeing.

However, our expectations were exceeded when we got to the hotel. We figured early on that the hotel was by no means central and perhaps that is why we got such a good price. We had a fair amount of travelling because we got a super-cheap flight to Girona airport but because we had researched the hotel we were prepared for this. We had to get into the city centre (vis Barcelona bus) and then use the metro to get to the hotel (which is right at the very end of this metro line). By the time we got there we were pretty exhausted (I always take an excessively big case so I'd advise a lighter case if you are getting to the hotel via public transport - especially at the hottest time of year!) but upon walking into the hotel you are greeted by a refreshingly cool reception area that has lovely decor and welcoming staff. Our room was out of this world. The room itself was massive and had a sofa by the window. Our view was of the hospital side but this was still a lovely view on a sunny day! Beside the room was another room just as big which accommodated the shower, toilet and a large sink area and wardrobes...kind of like a dressing area actually. I could have stayed in the shower for hours it was so good. We had breakfast included in our deal and the selection was the best selection I have ever had - hot and cold choices of any breakfast food you can think of. I don't normally bother too much with breakfast but you could not resist here. Unfortunately we did not find the hotel restaurants for dinner to our tastes and they also seemed pretty expensive so I cannot comment on that. I was unwell one evening so we had no choice but to stay in for dinner and order room service and the only thing I liked was a plain pizza (but I am a fussy eater so perhaps that's no measure of the choice - menu was quite limited though) and that was quite expensive for what I got. We did not use the complimentary leisure facilities next door as we were out and about all day every day. We stayed for 6 days and the commute (about 20minutes into the centre via metro) 4 times a day (out and back then out for dinner and back) did get a bit tiring so I wouldn't stay here as a tourist for more than about 10 days or you'd maybe start resenting it. But the quality of the hotel at the price we got it more than made up for the commute. Plus being so far out meant it had a tranquil 'holiday' feel as opposed to the usual 'city break' bustle. If you want to go out for nights out you also need to consider this as last metro train is midnight during the week and ten to one on the weekend so we almost missed the last train one night by having a late dinner and stroll along the harbour area. I would definitely stay here again as it was a great out of the way location but within easy reach of the city centre and the facilities and quality were just incredible.

The rooms are gorgeous, great bed, ,massive bathroom, electric curtains that keep the light out at all times. Great shower. Very clean. The only problem with this hotel is that it is literally in the middle of nowhere... You have the metro a 2 minutes walk away which is great but if you want a bottle of water that doesnt cost \u00a33.50 from the hotel u either have to go to the train station vending machine or travel further out. On our last night I was starving and had 2 options, get the metro or pay \u00a330.00 for a room servise hamburger,,,which was lovely but not worth \u00a330.00! If you stay here u have to be here happy to use the meto frequently during the day and maybe go to a supermarket and stcok up cos there is no restaurants or shops anywhere in walking distance of the hotel. The number 46 bus from the airport stops outside the hotel- a much cheaper option then a 30 euro taxi at only 1.40. Also it is a very good idea to get a travel card as soon as you arrived. We got a 3 day travel card that allows you to use all modes of transport for 15 euros and if your planning on staying at this hotel you are going to need a travel card as its the only way out!

The metro is not a problem for me(v easy to use) and my hubby as we are 25 and use the metro alot in london but it does become a bit of an issue if u wish to go out during the day and return to get changed for the evening, as it takes 15-20 minutes to get to catulunya station(la ramblas) I found we stayed out from 10-10pm as it was too much of a journey to go and come bk to get changed so i didnt get to where my best outfits as i didnt want to wear them during the day!

The metro leaves about every 4 minutes, so it's usually hop right on, grab a seat (as you will be the first on the metro, end of Line 1), and relax for 15-20 minutes before getting to the city. This was not a hassle for us at all. In fact, no matter where you stay in the city you'll likely be taking the metro, so it's not a big deal. It was nice to have a peaceful place to rest in the evening. The shuttle to the airport is extremely convenient. However, I'd recommend taking a taxi to the hotel or jumping on city bus 46 (1.40 euro). We avoided eating at the hotel bc of the prices, but we found a great cafe about 2 blocks away that is open 7 days a week. It's called 365 dias, I believe. Go there for 1 euro cafe con leche and pastries. Also, be sure to eat at Crema Canela when you are in the city. We love it there! Great food and amazingly low prices. (Make a reservation, or be prepared to wait) Last note, all the staff were extremely friendly.

If not, it is a poor substitute for being in the city. Yes, there is a metro stop opposite but there are many many hotels to choose from in the centre. Thirdly, the rates can be very good.

The staff were always polite, efficient and courteous and I dealt with several different people throughout my stay. I cannot agree with reviews of terrible service by the front desk staff. The rooms are spotless and spacious and the views from the top of the building are amazing. I opted for the buffet breakfast at 15 euros per person which is worth it as there is no where else close by to eat breakfast and it is served til 11 at the weekends, so it is ideal for brunch before a day of siteseeing. Yes it is 15-20 mins from the centre of the city but the metro is easy, cheap and convenient and the peace and quiet and luxury that you get when you get in is worth is. And not everything you wish to see is in one place so you are going to end up travelling around on the metro anyway. I wouldn't want to stay in the centre of Barcelona anyway as it is very busy and noisy at times. Got a public bus (no 46) from the airport upon the advice of other trip advisor reviews, which was easy to find and the hotel shuttle back to the airport when I left. I honestly don't know how people can give this hotel 1 or 2 stars in their rating as the hotel itself is near perfect.

We had a deal through travelzoo which gave us free room upgrade, free minibar and free breakfast only for 69 euros a night. Many 1 and 2 star B&Bs charge this rate so thsi was a bargain. Staff spoke good english (especially when compared to how much spanish we spoke when going to their country) and were helpful. The room was fab. It had a living room and a bedroom with kingsize bed. Both rooms had TV with pay per view content as well as some satellite channel, however there was only one english channel- BBC World. The bathroom was faboulous with a whirlpool bath a shower and two seperate toilets ! The breakfast was excellent with all usual things. The location is a bit remote from the town centre but i suggest that if you are getting a good deal dont be put off by this. It is 5 minutes walk away from a metro station on L1 (last stop on L1) and the walk is safe with plenty of lighting in the area. L1 line takes you straight to the heart of barcelona in about 20-25 minutes. Bus also has shuttle service to airport and city centre. Timings very but bus to city centre starts at 10.20 am and last one is 5 pm and there are total of 5 timings between 10 am and 5 pm. The timetable is clearly marked in the reception lobby. There is only one entrace to the main reception so if someone says they were confused with where the bus leaves from please ignore it. Its not hard at all. some people have complained about the lift, but we had no problems whatsoever. To go to your rooms you have to swipe your card at lift entrance and then select which floor you want to go to. You will then be told which of the four lifts to use. Its very very simple. there is a SPA at hotel but we didnt use it. Also if a hotel shuttle is not running when your flight arrives or departs, i would suggest not to do a taxi and waste 20 euros. There is a bus no 46 which takes you from airport to the hotel in about 15 minutes and costs only 70 cents (if you have T10 card) or 1.35 euros if you buy onboard. The bus stops at both terminal 1 and 2 and stops in front of the hotel across the road. There is a underpass to taken when coming from the airport while going back to aiport there is no underpass as you are on the right side of the road. hope that makes sense !! The bus had a lot of luggage space and was quite empty both times we travelled, so dont be put of if you have some luggage. A final note that the hotel shuttle to and from the airport stops at terminal 1 only and hence may not be suitable if you arrive at terminal 2 (as we did with easyjet). There is an internal shuttle between terminal 1 and terminal 2 but this is even more reason to use the bus no 46. While going back even though we had a hotel shuttle avilable we chose the bus no 46 to avoid this hassle (and also we had spare jouneys on T10 card)..

When we went there, it opened late, and no one was there to assit, a nice looking lounge but there were no bottle openers no cups for coffee, glasses for the wine and no assistance. In addition it is also advertised as providing food, however only a few stale biscuits and nuts were provided. When we called down for a ssistance, they took 20minutes to arrive and were very rude and unhelpful. Overall, a great hotel, I would recommend to go there only IF you get a really good deal do NOT pay full price, it won't be value for your money!

Trendy Chic and comfortable with luxury amenities. The rooms were roomy by European standards. The shower, FABULOUS! Great water pressure and 3 different shower head options (rain shower head, shower head hose/handle and the car wash option with 6 sprays from the wall) and loved how the water drained from a slit in the marble slab. I never wanted to leave the shower! The towels and bed linens were luxurious! Towels thick and soft. A frosted door separates the bedroom from the bathroom suite and another frosted door separates the toilet from the rest of the bathroom. Window curtains opens and closes with a push of the bedside button. A Plush couch even fits in the room without being too cramped. Our rooms included breakfast which had a nice fancy spread with variety. However the spread never changes and can get boring since the same thing is served everyday. Also offered is free Wi Fi which we didn't have any trouble connecting into from our room on the 18th floor but they will charge you to use their business center which is kind of lame. Staff was a bit cold and unfriendly but got the job done. All we cared about was the comfort of a nice room after a long day of walking and sightseeing. Location could be closer to the center of town but at least it wasn't far from the Red line (last stop on the Red line at Hospitalet de Belvitge) and you only need to cross the parking lot above the metro and the street to reach the hotel. We felt safe from the Metro at night to the hotel and was able to lug our bags easily as the entire parking lot and sidewalk is paved. The hotel also offered airport shuttle to BCN (which we didn't have any trouble taking to return to the USA). We didn't get a chance to take the shuttle to the hotel from BCN or the drop off to city center at Catalunya from the hotel but it is a nice option the hotel offers. However, the drop off into the city does not offer a return to the hotel, which is kind of weird but at least it saves you one trip ticket from the Metro.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201ccold burgers & confusing lifts\u201d", "Author": "dsteinway", "ReviewID": "UR39747535", "Content": "the service in this 5* hotel is dire. you are best off ordering 1 hour before you get hungry and whatever you do, don't order food from the bar unless you like your food freezing cold. the hotel uses a complicated computerised lift system which will leave the most seasoned traveler completely baffled. it's ridiculous and unnecessary. it's location is awful unless you need easy access to the conference center. you cannot walk anywhere unless you like walking through social housing.

Normally I am fine with heights and looking out over Barcelona was lovely, (I was on the 13th floor - get an even number or you look out over building areas and carparks) but at this hotel you can only get to your floor by swiping your room key by the lifts and are told which lift to take straight to your floor. The lifts are on the outside of the building and the only other way of travelling between floors is by fire escape - alarmed glass doors and a metal spiral staircase outside of the tower. The floors and walls are designed to look reflective and/or transparent and made me feel the need to check where I stepped all the time, though you do get used to it. In the lobby lift area the floor is transparent so you can see the gravel underneath it, and the bathroom area of the room, which you step straight into from the hall is all black marble and mirrors which takes several minutes to adjust to. It took me a while to realise that the wardrobe was a hanging space next to the sliding mirror in the bathroom, and not in the bedroom. All in all I found it rather disconcerting and the effect has disturbed my sleep since I've returned, dreaming of lifts with no sides and falling from great heights through disappearing floors!!! I cannot fault the staff there though. They took interest in and helped me with any query and everything was very clean and shiny (!!). There are a few things which I feel they need to sort out though to deserve their stars - on the last day of my stay, I booked out in the morning, spent the day in Barcelona, returning as arranged for the airport shuttle bus and was directed to the lobby toilets when I asked for somewhere to freshen up for the flight home.

I booked the trip as a suprise for my partners birthday and we travelled from the 30th July - 3rd August so had 4 nights. We arrived late at night so the shuttle wasn't available to us, however no big deal seeing as getting a taxi from the airport is incredibly easy with plenty waiting outside! The Fare is 20 Euro which isn't too bad and quite frankly, it woldn't have made much sense for the hotel to put the shuttle on just for the two of us! The hotel is very impressive upon arrival, the design is modern and its very state of the art, definitely what you would expect from a 5 star. The woman on reception was vry friendly, checked in us quickly and even asked us what floor we wanted to be on and if we wanted a king size bed! We opted for the 20th floor and the king size bed! The room was a deluxe so we didn't have access without paying additonally for the pool, fitness, tower club etc. however we found that we didn't even have time to use them seeing as we did so much sightseeing. A key thing to remember is that you get what you pay for. Having done a little investigation in advance, we knew exactly what we were getting and quite frankly, didn't want to spend our time in the tower club as its a city where theres so much to see and do during the day and in the evening! There was a small bar that did food also in the hotel and we sampled a couple of cocktails, champagne and some Rioja during our stay. Have to say all were of excellent quality and the bar staff were second to none. They were friendly, accommodating and more than happy to give advice on the local area or simply just talk about your day! When they realised it was my other halfs birthday, they brought him out a small slice of chocolate cake with a candle which was a lovely and very personal touch! The highly rated restaurant EVO and Bouquet bar were closed during our stay. We think this was down to it being low season in the sense of how busy the hotel was or staff may have been on vacation. it didn't really bother us seeing as we had planned to eat out every night. We did order a Veal Burger from the bar and we both agreed that it was possible the best burger that we had ever had - beautifully cooked with perfect garnish. The other food on the menu also looked fantastic so i'd like to try more if I returned! its not cheap, however if you pay a bit more then its well worth it! Several have mentioned the hotel is outside the city centre, however this is very clear when booking the hotel so its not something warranting complaint as it isn't right in the centre. It is however, very easily and cheaply accessible. The hotel runs several shuttles into the centre of Barcelona free of charge (just make sure you're there a few mins before to guarantee your place) and the Metro is literally straight opposite and you can buy a 10 trip ticket for just over 7 Euros which is a bargain! it takes about 15/20 mins to get to the centre and runs till late at night so very easy to use and we had no problems whatsoever. Back to the hotel, the rooms were beautiful - spotless and modern with nice flat screen tv, two sinks in the bathroom, a very large shower with jets and two shower heads and separate toilet. The safe was free of charge to use which was handy and the oom was always cool after a long day walking around in the heat. Overall all, the hotel we thought was very remarkable and the staff we encountered were lovely, friendly and happy to help and would definitely go back again.

The shuttle was not available to pick us up from the airport so we had to pay 20 euro's for a taxi (even though the meter stated 10.50, the taxi driver pointed to a sign which stated the minimum fare from the airport to anywhere was 20 euros!). We arrived at 11.30 in the morning so was not expecting to be able to check in but Albert on reception was very helpful and friendly and got us checked in quickly. No concierge or porter around. The room was lovely and very nicely decorated but quite small, I expected a little better considering the 'upgrade'. The shuttle bus does run to the timetable stated on the hotel website but if you get it into the centre of Barcelona you're expected to get back via the metro - the metro is easy to use and the nearest station is situated in the hospital car park opposite the front of the hotel. The train carriages themselves are blissfully airconditioned but be prepared to roast whilst walking to the right platform and waiting for the train! It takes about 20 minutes to get back from the city centre. The beach club was quite nice, make sure you get the voucher from reception before going as you need to hand it to one of the staff when you arrive, then they furnish your sunbed with a cushion and give you a towel. There is a outside bar available for drinks, snacks and ice creams and it seemed to be waitress service for the Spanish, but not for English. Like the previous reviewer, we were told the beach club access was only for one day but argued at Reception and eventually won an extra free day - however, having to deal with Elga on Reception nearly caused me a burst blood vessel, I have never had to deal with anyone so rude, petty and petulant in my life! She needs firing, fast! Unlike the previous reviewer, I thought the beach and the sea were gorgeous and didnt come across anything horrible in the sea. In fact I spent a great deal of time in the sea enjoying the big waves that were rolling in. The breakfast buffet was lovely, a great selection of food which was replenished frequently, I was thoroughly spoilt for choice. Apart from the location issue, the other downsides of this hotel were the charges for EVERYTHING and the business feel. However, for the price we got it for it was amazing so I cant really complain. There is a fantastic restaurant perched on top of the hotel in a space age bubble, the chef has 5 Micelin stars......I couldnt wait to treat myself and my partner to dinner and experience the cooking of such a chef......but the restaurant was closed for two weeks for the holidays....!!! In summary, nice hotel, mostly nice staff (except for evil Elga, watch out for her and avoid if possible), the shuttle does a reasonable job and the rooms are well decorated and comfortable.

The building was designed by Richard Rogers and looks sort of space-age like. The first thing I would say is, yes, it is not near the city centre of Barcelona, but they do provide a free shuttle bus that takes you to the centre of town, 3 times a day. The same shuttle bus also goes to the airport, but rather infrequently so it might not be so convenient. Breakfast is pretty costly, although they did offer us a discount from 24 euros to 16 euros. Using the swimming pool costs 10 euros per visit. Some reviews have said that there is nothing in the surrounding area of the hotel, but there is actually a small supermarket (called Caprabo), a fruit and vegetable shop, a cafe, and some other small shops within 5 minutes walking distance. It's on one of the smaller streets so it's not immediately obvious. The underground metro is also 5 minutes away (in the opposite direction to the shops). They also have a free service that allows you to check in for your flight online using one of there computers in their small business centre. They will keep an eye on you partly to assist you and partly to make sure that you really are using it for online check in and not for checking your emails! Do take notice of the mini-bar: each drink is on a special tray with sensors underneath. If you remove a drink, it automatically sends a signal to reception that you have removed a drink from the mini-bar, and you will be charged for it. Therefore, you cannot removed their drinks to keep your own drink cool. The same sensors can be found underneath the snack tray. So, I would certainly recommend this hotel - there isn't really anything negative to say. For us, it was more or less ideal. But some people might want to return to the hotel in the afternoon either for a nap or to get changed for the evening. It is certainly not very convenient in that sense. A 20 minute car journey from the city centre would make this very time-consuming", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cHotel excellent, staff distinctly average\u201d", "Author": "FOODFANS", "ReviewID": "UR34933683", "Content": "We booked this hotel after getting an excellent deal via travel zoo which offered 50% off the standard rate. We chose to upgrade to a tower club room as this included more amenities. The hotel is located outside of the main city centre but we didn't find this a problem as the hotel provide a shuttle service to the city centre which runs approx 6 or 7 times a day and also the local metro station is very close to the hotel, this run until approx 12 or 1 in the morning so good for getting back on a night and felt safe. We purchased a 10 journey metro ticket for 7 euros which we thought was excellent value. The journey into town was approximately the same approx 20 mins on the shuttle bus or metro. As we had paid for a tower club room we expected check in at the tower club lounge, this was not available although check in at main reception was smooth and efficient. Upon checking in to the room, the room was an excellent standard (the largest we have experienced travelling all over the world) with a seperate lounge and bedroom area with two 40inch flat screen tv's. The bathroom was just something else, it was huge, large jacuzzi bath, massive power shower, seperate toilet and large wash basin area with double sinks. The bathroom amenities were all Bvlgari and there was everything we needed, slippers, choice of robes, shoes cleaning kit, comb, brush etc etc. On our confirmation it said we would receive flowers and fruit on arrival, this was not the case and when we asked reception about this they kindly provided us with Champagne and strawberries and chocolate. On our second day in the hotel we had been out all day into Barcelona and came back to find our room door has been left open by the maid which we were not very happy about at all and although all of our valuables were in the safe this was not the point, we immediately complained to reception about this and they said they were sorry and if we needed anyone to come up to the room they would send someone. So we paid a bit extra for the tower club room which was definately worth it as we had access to the tower club lounge which provided free drinks and snacks all day as well as free internet access. The lounge was spacious was comfortable settees and tv and bang and olufsen cd player as well as a range of books and newspapers. At the time we were there it was very quiet so we basically had the run of the place to ourselves. We definately got our monies worth on the free bar. We had slight problems when things needed replenishing as there was no member of staff on the tower club reception which seemed an issue because this meant anyone could use the lounge.The tower club room also got access to the spa facilities although we did not have time to use this. Breakfast was included in our room rate and was served on the fourth floor and there was lots of choice of hot and cold food, pastries and bread, fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, cereals. During the week breakfast finished at 10.30am and a couple of mornings when we went down at 10am there was little choice and when we asked if they had any more produce they didn't so it was worth getting down earlier for breakfast. Again this was definately worth getting it included in the room rate. Staff seemed friendly and pleasant although didn't go out of their way to help you which isn't what you would expect from a five star hotel. Overall a room this size and hotel of this quality set in central Barcelona would cost in excess of 200 euros per night so the value is unquestionable however the quality of service and general finishing touches with which you would associate with a five star hotel were sometimes missing in this case. The hotel has the ability to be sensational but only succeeds as average.", "Date": "July 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corin Lianides (NYC & Madrid)", "Title": "\u201cclean and modern--but a little far out\u201d", "Author": "Corinlia", "ReviewID": "UR34597574", "Content": "We stayed in the Hesperia Tower 5 for a weekend trip to Barcelona because of the great deal we got from their website. The hotel is primarily a business hotel and so it seemed they were offering summer deals to travelers to try to fill their rooms. The hotel is very modern and well-designed and even has a 5 star Michelin restaurant at the top of it (in the spaceship-looking part). Our room was big and comfortable, and the bathroom was absolutely huge and incredible. We were on the 20th floor and had a STUNNING view of all of Barcelona, from the Barca FB stadium to the Sagrada Familia to Montjuic--seriously amazing! Our room was very clean and smelled fine, but our friends just 2 doors away had a room that smelled pretty strongly of cigarette smoke--even when they has specifically asked for a non-smoking room. The rate we received included a breakfast at the restaurant on their 4th floor, which was very good, and varied. Definitely worth eating that breakfast to ready yourself for a day in Barcelona. On the flip side of that, if there had been no included breakfast there was no way were were willing to spend 24 euros on the continental breakfast (per person)--and there were no restaurants or shops nearby that we noticed to grab anything. At one point we walked 10 minutes to a gas station to grab a snack while waiting for a friend to arrive from London... We also had a rental car, which we were able to park for free on the street close the hotel--a real plus for us! The negative aspect of the hotel was the distance from the center city of Barcelona. This hotel is really for business travelers that are using its attached convention center, or needing the hospital nearby rather than city tourists. The Metro was just across the street, however, with a direct line to Placa Catalunya, which is right at the top of the Ramblas. It did take up about 20-25 on the train, depending on the time of day, to get to Catalunya. Also, during the day hours there are taxis lined up outside the hotel to take you where you need to go, but at night they need to call a taxi for you. This can be considerably more expensive since in Spain the taxi can start running its meter from when it is called, and not just when it picks you up. This turned a normal 12-14 euro taxi ride into about 20-23 euros to the El Born district for us, which was a bummer.", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Victoria, BC", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but far away from city centre and expensive extra's\"\u201d", "Author": "Terry_in_Victoria", "ReviewID": "UR34058205", "Content": "I stayed 5 nights at this hotel in June 2009 after getting a flight and hotel deal on \"lastminute.com.\" This hotel was definetly newer and a 5 star.

The pool is indoors and is not included in the hotel stay, it is $12 euros per day of use. It is $5.50 euros for a can of coke from the restaurant. It is $20 euros for breakfast and $20 euros for a hamburger.

Prior to my arrival I had researched on tripadvisor several different locations. I finally made my choice which was not this hotel. I arrived 3 days prior to my departure for a cruise and was to remain for an additional 5 days after my return. I decided prior to my arrival that I would chose a different hotel for the second part of my stay in order to properly experience Barcelona. When I left the cruise I still had not made a reservation at any hotel so in my haste I returned to my first hotel only to find that they did NOT have availability at the end of my stay. I asked the concierge for a recommendation figuring I should stay somewhere closer to the airport, and she recommended this hotel. I had read the reviews, seen the website, and was completely sold! I decided to treat myself and stay in a suite. With all of the amenities, the service the website boasted, and the visual excitement the pictures showed I knew this was the best choice and I had made the right decision! Upon my arrival, the bell guys showed attentiveness, and I immediately felt embraced. Once I began to check in I felt a little uneasy. I figured it was me and blew it off. The girl (Laura) at the desk checked me in, upsold me, handed me my key and shoed me off. I was famished and was left to asking the bellman where there was to eat. He recommended the resturaunt on the 3rd floor and I tipped him appreciatedly and departed. The resturaunt was busy as it was lunch time (3:00pm). After a few minutes I was seated. After a few minutes more I was brought a menu. After a few minutes more my order was taken. Now if you see where I'm going with this...eventually I got up and left. On my way out the girl at the door explained that they were busy and she could write down my order. I told her there was no need and proceeded to the bar. I only knew that was an option because I had read an earlier review where a couple was told their kids would not like the food and they were sent to the bar. The bar food was fine. Quick, and well done. I decided to go to the spa..figuring maybe I was a little stressed. (You have to go to the front desk to receive a token if entry to the spa is included with your room.) I proceeded to the front desk and was given directions on how to get to the Metropolitain Club/Spa which is attached to the hotel. Now in my haste I forgot to mention that I had stopped by the front desk prior to going up to my room, which is how I knew to stop by and receive a token. I had also been told at that time that I would have to walk outside and down the sidewalk to get to the spa. I thought that was crazy for the mere fact that I wasn't used to going through all of that trouble in a five star hotel. The Metropolitain Spa/Club was nice. I could not read a lot of the signs as my spanish is not great and there were no english translations so I guess you can say that's my fault. Not as many people here speak english as I had read prior to my arrival, but that may have been that they just didn't speak it to me, which I will write about in a different review. That evening I found out about a lot of things that were not explained to me concerning my room. I found these things out by visiting the website. Like my fresh fruit and flowers, that by the way I am still waiting for.... I requested a pink room prior to my arrival, and my room was made pink after I mentioned it to the front desk. I requested non-smoking and walked into a room with an ashtray and a cigarette burn on the couch. The bathroom was very clean and the amenities in there were very nice, although I did not arrive to a fully stocked room. The robe I received for the \"pink room\" had a faint smell to it...not musty, but as if someone had used it that was wearing perfume, and it had not been washed afterwards. Everytime I went to the club tower, which was always stocked very lovely with sweets, drinks, and alcohol, there was never a concierge present, and the occasions that there was, I was questioned as to my room number. Now I do understand that the floor is only for certain guests, but you would think that by my 4th night(which was my last), they would not ask again!!!! I did make mention of my unhappiness on the second night of my stay. There was no Manager available and the man at the desk (tall, skinny, dark hair), began to go out of his way to make my stay better. The girl (Laura) who had originally checked me in began to give me the cold shoulder. On the third night of my stay I was able to speak with the manager who sent champagne, water, chocolate and strawberries up to my room. Then he said he would speak with his general manager and get back with me on my last day, which at this point has not happened. It is actually my last night. I stayed in, and when housekeeping called I told them I would leave in an hour so they could clean my room. I returned two hours later to a still dirty room. I tried to look on the bright side and be understanding, but I can't help but note that my exceedingly high expectations of a five star hotel had to be lowered. What I expected from this hotel I did not receive. I felt the service was as if I were staying in a regular room in a 3 star. Maybe my expectations are too high, but what does that say of this property? I can only say, the hotel is beautiful, with great new technology. The gym, and jacuzzi are wonderful, and the Club Tower lounge food and beverage selection is remarkable. If that's all you need for your hotel stay then I recommend you stay here. Unfortunately the location is a bit distant, with employees who are incapable of giving solid directions. The language barrier (to include the lack of a presence of at least one english speaking channel that is NOT the news!!! i.e. FOX, which the other hotel did have) is difficult. And the overall service is just not to standard. I am still a little upset with the curtness of Laura at the front desk. I have to mention the Flamenco show she scheduled me for was awesome! The only problem is that when I asked to move up the time, or see if dinner could be added she said it was impossible without even calling. I asked her to call and she said she already knew. Unfortunate for her, when I arrive 45 minutes early for my show and 30 minutes late for dinner, they were able to seat me for dinner....makes me wonder...especially since I was given the same run around for a massgae and manicure the following day, which I had told them two days prior I would want to have done.

On two occasions we took a taxi from downtown to the hotel because we were out later than the metro was running. Both times we paid less than 15\u20ac to get to the hotel from the Born neighborhood. I have only a few suggestions for hotel improvements. They seem to be lacking in some standard services (that I am used to in cheap US hotels). I expected to have an iron, ironing board, and hair conditioner. I would recommend you bring your own conditioner because I wasn\u2019t able to find any small bottle at the grocery store.

We were all pleased with our stay and hope we can stay here again on another visit back to Spain.", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStyle over substance\u201d", "Author": "AkenatonLondon", "ReviewID": "UR23036748", "Content": "We stayed in the Hesperia Tower for 3 nights. Not my idea of 5 star luxury. No bath, just a shower. We were promised a city view, but got a motorway view. But worst of all, on our last night we requested an early wake up call for the following morning as we had to catch our plane home, and they failed to do the call. When we came down and complained to the duty manager, he and his reception staff did not seem at all bothered by this critical failure of service. And forget about the spectacular views from the glass dome at the top. Guests are forbidden to enter unless they eat there.

We updated to the tower club and was so well worth the 60euros per night!! We drunk the best champagne (yes champagne not cava) every night included in the price and when we finished one bottle they opened another. The express breakfast was lovely, a choice of cereals, fruit juices, cold meats, croissants and pastries. You could call in anytime in the day for drinks, coffee and snacks. Also included in the upgrade was membership to the Metro club next door which was a fabulous spa (small tip if you care going you need flip flops and a bathing hat for the pool). The staff at the hotel could not do enough for you and found them to be most helpful and tried very hard to get their english correct. The room was fabulous with a gorgeous view of the city, and the shower was out of this world. Although a few kilometres from town centre it is on the metro line and we got a 3 day ticket at very reasonable cost that enabled us to use the metro and buses to go anywhere in the city.

I cannot recommend this hotel enough, and we will certainly be visiting again!! Upon checking in, the receptionist noticed it was my boyfriends birthday the previous day. Just as we settled into the room there was a knock on the door and we received a lovely letter from the hotel manager congratulating my boyfriend on his birthday together with a bottle of champagne, strawberries and chocolate. A lovely gesture we thought. The bedroom is a good size for a modern hotel. Although the hotel is near a main road there was no noice what so ever. The bed was very comfortable as was the sofa. The floor to ceiling window allowed great views of the city and the automatic curtains was another unusual touch. Obviously the plug sockets are European, and fitted all our appliances perfectly well, no issue there. There are various sets of lights to accomodate for bed time reading, The heating system was easy to use, with a fan, cool and heat system, which you could set to high, medium or low. We found ourselves using the fan a lot of the time, even though it was November! The bathroom really does make the room though, the shower was fantastic, we couldnt get enough of the power jets. Very luxurious. A wide range of toilitries were topped up every day including shampoo, body lotion, shower gel, soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, shower cap, shaving set, shoe shine. The bathroom is more suited to couples however, as there are mirrors everywhere and you can see into the bathroom from the bedroom if you sit at the wrong angle! There are two door in the bathroom, one for the shower, the other for the toilet. The photographs really dont do the bathroom enough justice! Unfortunately we had to move rooms as the glass on our shower shattered when we were out, but this was not a big issue. The staff were apologetic but it was a matter of health and safety anyway. We booked this hotel on lastminute.com as a secret hotel. However, it is extremely easy to work out which hotel it is seeing as there arnt too many 5* hotels in Barcelona with 40 odd reviews! At \u00a3200 for 3 nights for two people it was a bargain!!!", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but way out of town\u201d", "Author": "Hibs-fan", "ReviewID": "UR20966031", "Content": "Stayed here for a long weekend in September. Mainly chose this hotel because I got it from Expedia for a great price for a five star hotel. The hotel its self is way out of town, but there is a metro station two minutes away (It is the first stop on the red line, the station is through the large car park across from the main entrance of the hotel). It took 25 minutes to get to the middle of town. The Hotel was very modern and cool. It has a very highly rated and expensive resteraunt called Evo on the pod on top of the building but this was closed during our stay. Given its location it is mainly a business hotel. It was quite close to the airport - cost about 12 Euro. The hotel also runs a shuttle bus to the airport 2 or 3 times a day at specific times - so it is useful if your flight times tie in with the bus schedule - we used it for a late evening flight - it left the hotel at 3pm, All the staff were very good and frendily with the exception of a young woman who was at reception in the evenings who was quite unhelpful. The rooms nice, you come in the main door into the very nice bathroom then there is a further glass door into the bedroom.

The rooms are worthy of a modern 5*. The beds are so comfy - real quality. The view from the 18th floor is stunning (not so great when on the ground). The lift system is the best yet! There is a Shuttle bus service to main tourist area. Jordi Vincente - the restaurant and Bar Manager was very helpful - thank you. Worst Features: No shuttle bus service from the main tourist area. Little bit out of the way when on a short visit to Barcelona. It takes a couple of days to realize that the metro is so near and so easy. The breakfast, although good quality food and of reasonable variety - there were no bowls for cereal, no plates for hot food, no side plates and this was when there were only 6 people in the restaurant. I complained to the management and the next day the manager and all the waiting staff were on their toes - determined to please. However, at 22 euros per person it was not my favourite part of the day. Worth noting the swimming pool is not included and a fee of around 12 euros per person per visit is charged. To sum up: I got a great deal on the stay and it was generally a lovely hotel so yes, I would stay again and if the breakfast service had been better I would have given it a 5.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "manchester", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel fantastic service\u201d", "Author": "cairo4", "ReviewID": "UR20525617", "Content": "Just back from a romantic weekend in Barcelona stayed at the Hesperia tower.
