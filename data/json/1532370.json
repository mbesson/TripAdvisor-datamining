It is in prefect location to restaurants, shops and walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofya , Topkapi Palace and the Spice Market. The hotel is old but d\u00c3\u00a9cor suits the style of the city. The rooms are small but relatively clean and have air conditioning. The bathroom is also small and the shower drain doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to cope well as the water backs up but doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t over flow however the beds are relatively comfortable. Housekeeping does a good job and the hotel staff are pleasant (most can speak a bit of English, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any problems). The hotel provides a continental breakfast and its pretty standard but it did the job for us. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lots of places to eat, as the hotel is located in the restaurant district and many more restaurants in the vicinity or on the way to the spice market or aya sofya. However make sure to double check your bill before you pay as some restaurants can be dodgy and over charge you (where we experience a few times) I think they must think that because we are tourist they can pull a swift one. Whilst in Istanbul be sure to visit the Spice Market for some shopping and remember to bring your bargaining skills. I found the Spice Market better than the Grand Bazaar but the Bazaar is worth a look (its huge and little a rabbit warren). The best place in Istanbul to get Turkish delight is Kosta located 50metres from the Spice Market, they have a big range and is affordable. Also not only visiting the usual historical sites (eg. Bascilla Cistern and the mosques) but also a visit to Taksim Square is need which is found over the river you get the tram and metro to get there. Taksim is the modern Istanbul with modern shops. I doubt we would return to this hotel as we are pretty sure we could find a better hotel in the same location.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Griffith, Australia", "Title": "\u201cJust and OK Hotel.\u201d", "Author": "dmcbella", "ReviewID": "UR111675339", "Content": "I did not enjoy this Hotel.

The reception staff could also have been a little friendlier. They do have free Internet and its location is off the busy streets and it is a good spot to be located in the middle of Grand Bazaar to Spice Bazaar areas. I would not stay there again.

Turn the corner to get the tram. Bunch of cafe and restaurants around (Pasazade restaurant is great, no pushy staff outside, calm Ottoman konak-styled place and tasty meal). BUT. Take ear plugs or be ready to listen to water flowing in adjacent rooms, people on the stairs returning late at night and muezzins early in the morning (actually, you could not hide from muezzins in any room =). Rooms are small, but if you have no purpose to spend all your time in the room, it doesn't bothers alot. Warning: there are two rooms on each floor with windows facing not streets or rear yard but inner well, just peace of sky above, window of another looser opposite and stair-windows aside %) Watch the room you check in, we arrived late in the evening and found weird space outside too late to move. Great view from breakfast room was our compensation, we have seen Bosphorus and Golden Horn of bird's eye view in some distance. Also watch your purses and other important things: two days before departing my friend left all the stuff from her bag on the bed and we went to have breakfast. We returned and realized that the room is already cleaned (strange as usually it was done after our leaving for all day long), and there was a shortage of 20 dollars in my friend's purse. She was sure she could not spare or lose it somewhere else as she counted it just yesterday evening. She decided not to talk to manager about the incident because of the further bore which did not worth our nerves and time. Anyway you may expext everyday towels changing, cleaning and adding the soap, shampoo and toilet paper in time. Just don't be an unconcerned person and staying in this hotel will be a worth-while..", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cJust average...\u201d", "Author": "dougalbean", "ReviewID": "UR59118128", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for two nights just before Christmas 2009. It's in a perfect location in Istanbul and walking distance to sites like the Hagia Sofia, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. There are also any number of good quality cafesand restaurants close by for lunch and dinner. The hotel itself is clean, though the hotel lobby is perhaps the nicest part of the hotel. The rooms themselves are acceptable, though my husband and I were given a twin instead of the double we requested. This would have been fine, however we had a largely sleepless nights in any case due to pipes rattling throughout the night. Every time a toilet flushed or a room above or nearby had a shower, the water squealed through the walls and then resonated for some time after with constant dripping-type noises. Was also disappointed with the breakfast. Both mornings we arrived at breakfast with 30 - 60 minutes to spare before the scheduled end time but were left with slim pickings.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Erbil Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1532370-Reviews-Erbil_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$58 - $328*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Hoca Pasa Mh.
