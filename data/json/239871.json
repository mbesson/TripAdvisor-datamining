This is coming from someone who works in the hotel industry and has a bit higher expectations in a hotel room. The last thing I expected was to not have a hair dryer in the room. 99% of Hotels do provide this ammenity. Office staff is not available in person 24 hours a day. I find that strange I guess they are on a reservation only or regular business hours only. This is odd being that they are located near restuarnts and other late night facilities. The suites do have a pot and pan, microwave refrigerator with ice trays. The bathroom was quite roomy.Remember to take your hair dryer!!", "Date": "Jan 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR870815992", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d239871-r17980757-Studio_6_Dallas_Northwest-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "239871", "Price": "$59"}}
