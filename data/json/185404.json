Earlier I had missed my connecting flight and after many hours I finally arrived at this hotel where I had a reservation guaranteed with a credit card. The lady at the desk told me that they had no rooms available and that my booking had been canceled because my credit card came back as declined. That of course was not possible since I had sufficient funds in my credit card. The staff told me that they absolutely had no rooms available and that I needed to check other hotels. Kindly they got on the phone and started calling around hotels near the airport (since I was catching another plane the next morning) and to my surprise nobody had rooms available. After about 30 minutes (I'm not kidding) they found me a hotel near the airport and I had no choice but to head that way. I was completely ripped off at this hotel. I paid a ridiculous amount of money at a hotel that only cares about booking people in without really caring about them. And all of this was of course caused by the Holiday Inn World Trade Center. Yes, the staff tried to help me find another hotel but at what cost? Rest assured I will never come to this hotel and will spread the word around with my colleagues. I felt totally disrespected by their lack of ethic and have nothing good to say about this place: avoid!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belize", "Title": "\u201cPlenty of choices in the city, this should not be one of them\u201d", "Author": "Vanilla_Custard", "ReviewID": "UR118849282", "Content": "On the whole, Mexico city turned out to be a pleasant surprise, the people are kind and gentle, the roads, despite some gloomy traffic queues, are still reasonable and there is a lot to do. Don't miss out on a trip to the Basilica, a must visit in the city. My room at Holiday Inn was small but the bed was comfortable, however, as things progressed it was clear that the hotel lacks intelligent management of any form. I had a number of simple maintenance issues in my room which ordinarily could have been overlooked or tolerated but as the stay progressed other matters simply compounded the nagativeness of the overall stay. In the room (105) I had a broken ironing board (2 days before it was broken) no hot water reported in the morning and it was still cold when i got back at 8 pm - 9 pm before i could take a shower, the bath tap was broken so the bath could only be filled using the shower, Internet access (despite claims of in room internet) was non existent and I was forced to sit in the bar all night to do my mails, digital clock was never set correct in 5 days, Leaking basin drain caused my case to become soaking wet (i stupidly put it under the sink area not expecting for leaky pipes). The lobby was stripped of furniture when we returned to the hotel on Friday evening and it stayed this way until we left on Monday. Ropes and yellow tape adorned the lobby while hundreds of people filled the lobby the entire week-end on events of some sort. Guests were left feeling second class to the group activities they were doing in their event room and there was no where for us to sit. Despite the negative comments the staff were pleasant especially Margarito in the bar a pleasant elderly gentleman who really took care of us and one of the house taxis Mauricio. He turned up in a small sporty blue car but his driving skills were excellent and we used him our entire stay. He was safe courteous, kowledgable and knew the streets inside out and back to front. He took my colleague into town to see the city while i worked and i felt comfortable leaving her in his capable company. I ate every night expect one in the bar area, food varied greatly and was not brilliant, at best a decent cafe meal. Pasta Carbonara on the first night was a mountain of tagliatelle by the last night it was a few mouthfuls and gone! I had one breakfast at around US$ 20 thought it was expensive. We took some sandwiches from the little cafe next door for breakfast one day and then had two breakfast at Starbucks in Santa Fe, where we were attending an event at Bancomer exhibition centre. On the last night they even failed to open the bar, again i suspect because of the big crowds for some in house event. We gave up and went across to the road to a great steak house, cant remember the name but directly across from the hotel entrance and the meat was simply mouth watering, For the two of us it came to around US$ 70. On the last night i asked for a manager to make a complaint about the various issues and she said she would reflect a discount of some sort, i did not really work out what that related to. In fairness the guest service manager wrote to me by the time i reached back home and i will reply to her though this story is pretty much the sum total of my experience at the hotel. I imagine that week day the hotel may be tolerable but on week-ends they seem to have these big events (something alluded to by the staff) pretty much all the time. My colleague in room 104 said she did not experience any in room challenges except the lack of internet which was for her rather frustrating. Loved the city and it's people, will choose another hotel in returning next year to do the same travel show.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBelow average about right\u201d", "Author": "The_Tr8vel_Bug", "ReviewID": "UR116382686", "Content": "Really poor...

I was attending a Trade Show at the World Trade Center and most hotels around the WTC itself were sold out. This property is about a 10 minute drive away from the WTC and they run a complimentary shuttle three times daily to the WTC.....in any case a cab ride costs about 8USD....but the fares can vary quite a lot as they have zone fares in Mexico City now, instead of metered fares...good idea to establish the fare prior to the ride. I found the hotel OK.....I booked an executive room at a reasonable rate. The property feels safe and fairly well run in the Mexican fashion, which is to say that things are a bit disorganized at times, but in general the service was prompt and friendly. The internet connection was fine....my \"apartment\" was spacious, clean and while I needed a repair in the bathroom, it was done in fairly promptly and competently. I liked the location of the hotel, on the Revolution Avenue, adjacent to a nice residential neighborhood known as San Pedro de las Pinas, which features leafy streets and nice flats. The area seems safe and many locals are walking calmly in the streets...there are plenty of EXXO stores, banks, ATMs, shoe shine stands, small stores, etc. I got two pair of shoes shined for less than $5 in aggregate ( and I had tipped generously). The location, away from the congestion and bustle of the Trade Center, was also nice....much quieter and more relaxed. I thought the staff's English was generally OK.....I am a fairly competent Spanish speaker.....so, if necessary....I could easily shift to Spanish to clarify a point here and there. The restaurant was fair.....certainly adequate.....the service eager but disorganized...and the food mediocre but again, I'll use the word adequate. A complimentary Executive Lounge on the sixth floor featured self serve Continental Breakfast and snacks throughout the day and evening. I was grateful to find this property, proximate to the WTC, but not right at it. This is, after all, a Holiday Inn, not a Four Seasons.....the rates were extremely reasonable and the hotel met my needs. There were a couple of young women working as Concierges; one was the actual Concierge and one was in training. They were quite helpful in assisting me to organize some activities for a free day I had after the Trade Show was over. There are just so many interesting things to see and do here in Mexico City, that one needs some planning to hit highlights that meet personal tastes. This hotel is not a palace, but neither are the rates Palace rates......I think you get what you pay for here and I was fine with it.", "Date": "October 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cfailed to serve\u201d", "Author": "mariajohnson11", "ReviewID": "UR64861385", "Content": "Phone didn't work after many complaints.

Apparently they have put me in an exclusive section of the hotel that I didn't ask for. The customer service was awful, a lot of apologetic explanations but no serious actions. They do not care about their customers, at least that is how they made me feel. After all the discussion, they finally allow me to go back to my room at 3:00am in the morning where all of my traveling documents (including my passport) and my baggage were. Instead of honoring the hotel fare they had given me, I ended up paying the increased fare for the unsolicited exclusive section of the hotel. There are a lot of good hotels around the corner.
