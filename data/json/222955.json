This was a joke. The positives: pretty lobby, friendly frost \"desk\" staff. Room was clean, pretty new, and nice. Typical. But, here's the negatives: absolutely horrendous service. This hotel is fused with a local, but nice, gym. There is NO ritz: gift shop, spa, or quality restaurant. The two restaurants on location are modern and in no way, up to par with a Ritz Carlton with respect to atmosphere. You barely see any hotel attendants unless you are right in the lobby area, which is extremely, extremely boring. The bar area doesn't open until 5pm, and there is nowhere to get a snack unless you go to the attached, non-ritz operated and very crowded gym establishment. In sum, this place felt like an older marriot or typical hilton city hotel, which was stamped with the Ritz logo in certain places and given a few cosmetic upgrades. It absolutely pales in comparison to the Four Seasons which is just a few blocks away. When I walked towards the Four Seasons: there were 3-4 doormen, a greeter, a TRUE front desk and concierge, not just two small desks like the Ritz, and I saw staff everywhere. Granted, this is not a resort, it is a city hotel, but there is no warmth to it. No charm, and having no RITZ-owned spa services just kills this place. Basically, you cannot sit at the hotel all day and relax, there is absolutely no choice of options, unless you want to sit in a boring looking lobby with minimal service aside from the concierge and front attendants who were helpful. Just an average place to stay if you need a room, but by no means a Ritz Carlton experience. Stay away, and go to the Four Seasons down the block.

Pricey, but so are most places in Boston. Room was nice, washroom was nice in our room. No complaints at all with the building itself. My issue was with the service at the hotel, especially given that it is supposed to be a 5-star AAA hotel. There were lots of people working all of time, especially in the check-in/concierge area. And there were always people who were not actively serving a customer. Yet when we arrived to check in, we had to wait for someone to come and help us. Then when we came to the concierge desk, there was no one there. We waited, obviously looking for help when one of the other staff finally came over and attempted to help us. What a joke that was, we were shown a map of Boston and taught that Cambridge was across the river. Wow, that helped. That night, I noticed there was some hair in the bathroom. I cleaned it up before my wife saw it and freaked out. The next day, we again got help from the concierge. This time, helpful with a dinner suggestion and making reservations. Except, it took more than 1/2 hr to get a call to our room saying the suggested restaurant was full. Not sure what took so long. But another suggestion was made and reserved for us. Which was great, except we never got a call back to say it was booked. We had to stop by the desk to hear that it was confirmed. Godd suggestion though - Stoddard's (I reviewed it very positively). Then I tried to call the spa to make appointments for us. 10 calls, no answer. Now I realize it is run separately from the hotel, but I really don't care. Reality is, I should get an answer. So we went to the spa to make our massagge appointments only to find out that the pool was closed. We were never told that and honestly, would never have booked there if we did know since we all wanted to swim. Note - there is a $15 per day charge to use the gym next door, they do advertise this on the hotel web site. Finally, we left our bags for the day as we checked out but had a late evening flight. Just getting our bags back was a nuisance as apparently only 1 person has the key and we had to wait for him while I watched 5 other staff chit chat and do nothing in the lobby. Very annoying.

As previously noted in reviews, the hotel is more modern than many other Ritz-Carlton's, but we still found it welcoming. We had an executive suite, which had enough room for our family of 5 with a rollaway (3 children under the age of 9). The room was nicely decorated, and the king bed in the bedroom was very comfortable. I was not impressed with the quality of the sofa bed, but at least they gave us a featherbed topper to put on top of it. The bathrooms were outstanding, in particular the full bath in the bedroom, and I really liked having a \"coat closet\" in the front foyer. The location of the hotel is convenient to most attractions, but it's in a rather random few blocks on the edge of Chinatown and in the middle of a couple of schools, so there are a lot of students and bars. There are not a lot of restaurants in the immediate vicinity (2 block radius) , however that is not a huge consideration for most people. On the slight downside, the staff was helpful, but not overly so - I've had more helpful staff at other similar hotels, but that alone would not dissuade me from the Ritz-Carlton Boston. For me, the biggest downside (which was still rather minor) is that they really didn't make any accommodations for the kids. Frequently at similar hotels, there will be a small treat waiting for the kids in the room (coloring book or similar), or the housekeepers will do something sweet with their beds (a treat, or tucking in their doll, etc.) - but really they were pretty much overlooked during our stay. I did note in the book in our room that they offered amenities for the kids - bathrobes, etc. - but there were none in our room and it wasn't worth it for me to call housekeeping. Note, this was a minor detail on a very nice stay - it was not that the kids were unwelcome, and everyone was very kind to them. Overall, we had a great trip, and a lovely stay at the Ritz-Carlton Boston. Would we stay there again?

If you are a traveler who doesn't like to risk having a so-so hotel experience (I don't) and tend to stick to the Four Season's, RItz Carlton et al, I highly recommend this as an easy choice for Boston. On one Boston visit, I saved around $150 a night, and what a mistake, when I booked elsewhere.

At 9 am I didn't have the pants. 9:15 someone knocks asking me if I needed laundry picked up...No, I am missing some pants ...9:30...I called and was basically told by the folks in the laundry area that I should get the pants to them earlier if needed them by 9 am. Then they couldn't find them. Then they said it was not their fault and on and on...it was really frustrating. Got the pants, still damp...late for my meeting. I felt horrible for being \"that guy\", though, and that I put them out so much. I honestly never try and test this service at hotels..But it was really underwhelming too.. I spoke to someone, didn't get his name, at check out and he apologized and said he would not charge me for the pants and \"was there anything else he could do\"?

The best part of the hotel and what truly sets it apart from the other hotels in Boston is the Sports Club LA Boston. My husband and I were truly impressed by the facilities. There are 2 floors of gym equipment and 1 floor of rooms for workout classes. The classes are excellent and very challenging. In addition to the gym facilities there is also a separate spa and salon. We really enjoyed using the Sports Club LA/Boston and wish there was a gym like that for us back home. The area that needs improvement is when you enter through the doors on the way to the elevator. The check-in was mediocre. We've gone to other Ritz Carlton properties that offer champagne during check-in In this situation, the bell man was thoughtful enough to offer us water as waited for the woman at the front desk to check us in and then get rushed through for the next guests waiting behind us. We were asked why we were visiting and we said it was for our anniversary, yet the hotel did nothing...not that I was expecting chocolate strawberries but not even a note when we arrived in the room..nothing.

So, naturally, when we drove up from NJ we just drove straight there only to find that the marquee now read \"the Taj\" WHAT!!

OK, nobody panic. We moved from Boston 13 years ago, and since then it is apparent that the city of Boston has invested in this area dramatically! They have completely revamped the area to a very safe and popular part of the city. And from the moment we stepped out of our car the service was exemplary. The lobby is trendy and inviting. The service and the rooms were exactly what you would expect from the Ritz. Furthermore, i came to realize that this relocation was probably a very well thought out business decision.

This hotel was chosen for it's quality, attentive service and mostly because it was so central and offered valet service, a necessity for our first time in Boston. As we arrived from an 9h trip, we were taken care of by Brad at the front desk, who welcomed us in French (and we felt we were still home). Then we met the wonderful Sherly Michel, who was our contact for any question and spoiled us. On our second evening I ended up with a severe food poisoning from another restaurant (Durgin Park in Quincy Market), and I think it's really when we realized to what extend they wanted us to feel like home. The staff from the cuisine (Betty in particular) brought me thumbs in the middle of the night hoping they would help. All the concierges were aware of my condition, and were always available for any need whenever I called them. In the morning, when we realized we needed to be hospitalized, Sherly accompanied us; as we are Canadian citizens, we were unsure of what to do, and she stayed with us until we were taken care of, a good 3 hours later. She helped us fill paperwork, made sure we would have anything we could possibly need on top of what she already had to do that day. She also made sure my parents could find us in the hospital, had a good chat with them to explain what happened and how we were, and made sure that the minute we would be back in the hotel we would be taken care of by the staff. She hold my hand when I was scared and uncomfortable, reassured me and explained patiently anything I wouldn't understand. When you're really sick, away from home, in another country and in another language, having someone like her is such a blessing, and to stay in a hotel where you feel safe (and that your possessions are too while in the hospital) is such a relief. The staff knew who we were right when we came back, and attended our every need. And to our surprise, an exquisite bouquet with well wishes was waiting for us in our room. The next day we left to come back home early afternoon, and again, everybody was showering us with food, water bottles and make sure we were ok for the road. The careful, attentive, available, and generous staff, from the cuisine to concierges, doorman and coordinators and everyone in between will take care of you just like if you were family. Know that you'll be treated with the utmost respect, and be confident they'll do everything to make you feel comfortable and at home. We feel like we owed them so much, and the only thing they would say is that it was the least they could do.

Room service was great (albeit expensive), we had a decent view (although we didn't come to Boston for the view), and the room was beautifully appointed. One of the highlights of staying here is access to the Sports Club/LA, a phenomenal gym with everything you could ever want! Normally I hate paying extra gym fees - especially after paying for a room at the Ritz - but at $15/day it's a steal, it's just that great.

Had I known all this before my trip, I would have booked another hotel. In addition, although the building is modern and relatively new (built in 2001, I believe) it feels a bit cramped and unwelcoming in the lobby as the separate Spa & apartments take up a good portion of the available space. I also had the impression that hotel management was a bit lax and should have seen to it that the lobby and entrance were tidy and 'orderly'. (A table with a type of flower arrangement near the elevators went almost a day and a half with only stagnant water in the vases before the water was replaced and flowers put in.) I had several meals (a snack and 2 breakfasts) in the hotel restaurant and was fairly disappointed. Although the waitstaff was friendly and helpful, the meals were pricey and fully unspectacular. The atmosphere tried at urban chic and fell short. Another disappointment was that WiFi was an additional charge. For this class of hotel, one would expect it to be included. The room itself was not that large for a deluxe double room and the supposed views that were touted on the phone (all for an additional charge) turned out to be either a planted roof top garden or a few nearby buildings and a street view.

The ladies and gentlemen of the Ritz-Carlton are always extremely friendly and helpful. The room was on the club level (floor 12) which is the top floor of the hotel.

The location is wonderful - extremely close to Boston Common and the Public Gardens. Easy access to the T and close to several Boston tour trolley stops. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance, as well as Chinatown and the Theater district. The room was average in size with a separate bathtub and marble shower. I like the added touch of a mirror in the shower, as well as full length mirrors in the closet doors. We were traveling with a baby and the hotel provided a crib with bumper pads and a clean sheet as well as a small baby kit with shampoo, lotion, etc, and baby safety items (outlet covers, etc). The view was a city view but overlooked a modern rooftop garden display. We have previously stayed on other RC club level floors and the service here is excellent, however, I did notice a few things. The Boston club level closes at 10 p.m. sharp and is locked at that time. Other clubs we have visited were a bit more lenient, allowing guests to gather in this space without RC attendants, some even leave beverages out for guests to enjoy. Also, while the club level offers complimentary alcoholic beverages, the selection is limited. When a travel companion asked for a popular after-dinner drink, the attendant said the ingredients were not available and I ended up purchasing the drink downstairs in the restaurant bar and bringing it up. The food presentations were impressive with gorgeous desserts, a great breakfast selection, and filling mid-day snacks. You could easily eat all three main meals in the club. The concierge and club level attendants were extremely helpful in making dinner reservations. There is a house car with limited hours of operation so do inquire about it during your stay. The hotel also offers tea service with their special \"cupcake tea\" for guests of all ages.

The hotel is centrally located with easy \"T\" access and a short walk from all of downtown Boston. Club access is a real plus even though it costs a bit more - good continental breakfast, light lunch, and drinks in the evening with good snacks and desserts, interesting books. Outstanding personal service in the Club lounge make it a 5+. We were able to check in early as requested on our reservation. Some little things matter. When we checked in, the TV didn't work, the bathroom had one bar of soap for the sink, bath and shower (all separated). Total of 2 bath towels. A flimsy, cheap contraption bridged the nice deep tub for the sole purpose of holding 3 washcloths. The device fell into pieces when it was removed, and we buried it under the sink. RIP. The bath items were quickly corrected. Turndown was missed one evening. The TV story is tedious and I was given several possible causes. Fixing it took about 2 hours in the early evening. Be aware that the hotel is on narrow Avery St, midway between Tremont and Washington. Most rooms have direct views of commercial or condo buildings or rooftops of same. Very, very few rooms have a view of the Commons. Arriving or departing by vehicle at rush hours requires extra time and extreme patience. Both Tremont and Washington are 1-way and are jammed at these hours. If you plan to arrive/depart at these hours, best take the T for airport travel. If not for the transportation hassle, I would rate the location as a 5. Biking around Boston is friendly and easy. There are good paths along the waterfront, Charles River, and more. Many streets, especially in Cambridge, have bike lanes. I rented a bike from the friendly staff at t http://www.urbanadventours.com/about.php, which is a short walk from the hotel in the North End. They will deliver to the hotel and have tour/rental packages. I walked and picked up my bike at their store and took off with a good map of the city, which they furnish along with helmet and lock.

Although the Club Level is more expensive, it's a really good deal if you plan to use the Ritz as your base for exploring the city. We ate breakfast there, had mid-day snacks, pre-dinner drinks, and desserts later. When you add-up the amount you would have spent on this, the room rates aren't so bad. Except for breakfast, you shouldn't plan on making any of their Club Level food servings your meal for the day. It's mostly high-end appetizers, snacks, and drinks, so you'll want to eat lunch/dinner out. The location is very convenient next to Boston Common, and the key attractions in the city are easily walkable. There is a subway station about 5 minutes away in the park. We felt very safe on the streets, and the town is a great mix of history and modern attractions. Summary: we are not Ritz snobs who complain when staff forget your name or when the stay isn't 100% perfect, so we enjoyed our stay.

I found that the hotel had upgraded me to one of their \"Club Level\" one bedroom suites. The room was large (Two count them two bathrooms) a living room and a huge bedroom. The beds were amazingly comfortable and the entire suite was finished in elegant modern styles with traditional accents. Room service was prompt, delicious and reasonably priced. The room I had featured two large LG flat screen televisions and a Bang & Olufsen entertainment system. Cmplaints? Only one really, Like every other Ritz Carlton I have stayed in this one charged $9.95 per day for wireless internet. If I can go to Arby's and get free internet, I should be able to get no extra cost wireless at the Ritz Carlton. One other point, the Hotel employed a gentelman named \"Stanley\" as one of its doormen. Stanley was a great first contact for the hotel. He was thorough and efficient. A real asset to the Hotel.

A highlight of this hotel is the access to a sports club for a fee of fifteen dollars. Our package included admission. We feel strongly that spas and gyms should always be included in the price of the room, but this is one time when we would not have complained about the charge. This is one amazing gym.

My wife and my disappointment was in reference to the level of service and the Club Level accommodations. My wife and I first stayed at a Ritz-Carlton during our stay in San Francisco, and also had Club Level accommodations there. The two experiences could not have been more different.

Within the first hour of checking into the room, we were contacted to see if we needed any help with dinner reservations, tours or anything else in the area.

We were pleasantly surprised at the selection and quality of the food offered throughout the day at the Club Level Lounge. This was one of the best hotel experiences we have had, and was a key reason why we choose to select the Ritz-Carlton when we traveled to Boston. Our stay at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston Common, had a rocky start. We arrived at about 5:45, although we had originally indicated that our estimated check-in time as 2:00. Even though we arrived almost four hours after the time we indicated, our room was still not available. Although we indicated that we had dinner reservations, the person checking us in was not very responsive and prompt in fixing the situation. After almost 15 minutes, he finally gave us a temporary room to change for our dinner reservations. Because of this delay, we almost did not make our reservations. Even though the person checking us in indicated he would call when the room was ready, he never did. The absence of an apology and poor attention to detail was very offsetting. Fortunately our room was available when we returned. In the morning, we were also disappointed at the food available in the Club Level Lounge. There was a very limited selection and the quality was not what we had expected based on our experience in San Francisco. Because we were so disappointed in the selection and quality, we did not return to the lounge. Later that night we ordered room service. The food was horrible and part of our order was wrong. My wife and I were also disappointed in the concierge service. Although we inquired about a restaurant for Sunday night, we did not get any information.

Check-in: We arrived at the hotel late (around 9pm). We had reserved an executive suite room. Upon arrival, Sonya at the front desk upgraded us to a luxury suite. We were thrilled, but when we got up to the room, it was next to the elevator shaft, which was quite loud. So we called down to tell her we needed to downgrade back to the executive suite. Well, by that time, they must've given away our room (either that, or they never had it to begin with). We had to wait over an hour before another executive suite was ready. The new room had a Common view, but we were told the room was reserved for the next two nights, so we could only have it for one night. Room: The executive suite was so spacious. It had a hallway closet, half bath, spacious living room with a desk, french doors to the bedroom, a bedroom closet, large bath with double sinks, soaking tub, glass shower and toilet room. The bath products were Bulgari and there were complimentary products for the soaking tub. Service: The service at this Ritz-Carlton was just as stellar as you'd expect at any Ritz-Carlton. The door staff were friendly and would greet you each time you left and returned. We ordered room service each morning and it was always on time. On the last day, they did mess up one food item, but it was still delicious. Some of the nice touches included bottled water and towels for runners returning to the hotel after a jog in the Common each morning, complimentary hot chocolate each afternoon (so great after being in the blistering cold!) and a $1 million art collection throughout the hotel. You can ask the concierge for a brochure for the self-guided tour of the art. Location: This was the best part about this hotel. It is literally steps from Boston Common. It made it easy to walk the Freedom Trail and is close to many of the monuments Boston is famous for. We caught a matinee of Avenue Q at the Colonial and it was just a 10 minute walk. It's within walking distance of Quincy Market and just a little beyond that is the North End. It also has a train station nearby to get to other parts of the city. The only thing that I thought was weird was this hotel is connected to a movie theatre and is actually BEHIND it, so it does not directly face the Common. The hotel is on the 9th-12th floors of the building and only like two rooms on each floor face the Common - most rooms have a \"city view\" or a partial view of the Common. But there are lots of restaurants within walking distance, plus the shopping at Quincy Market. There's even a CVS just down the block. Food: We ordered room service each day for breakfast and the food was always great! They messed up our order one day, but we didn't mind because it was so tasty! They recommend reservations if you're having breakfast on Sunday morning, since Jer-Ne (the restaurant) is not that big. We had drinks in Jer-Ne one evening and the martinis on the menu were great. I highly recommend having something off the dessert menu. Check-out: It was quick and easy. The video checkout wasn't working, but they give you a statement on your door the last day and all you do is hand it to someone in the lobby if you have no disputes. Two days after we checked out, my credit card got some mysterious additional charges.

By 10:00am, when I had returned to my room, the hotel cleaning staff had emptied my room, thrown away my notes from a conference call I had scribbled on the bedside notepad, removed my clothes and dumped them in a lost and found bag. All this and I had not checked out yet! Now there was a conference in Boston that week and rooms were in short supply, but this treatment was ridiculous. They had basically emptied my room even though I had not checked out yet! I had to call clients on a saturday weekend (and spend some excruciating hrs waiting to reach another client who had taken an intercontinental flight) to go over their account details and follow up with my colleagues over the lost notes. Admittedly, some of it could be blamed on me for not backing up the data on my laptop, but I did not expect the hotel to throw away my personal effects with such alacrity .

While we have enjoyed both the Four Seasons and Langham in the past, the Ritz hotel and staff have made it impossible for us to stay anywhere else. While we certainly enjoy the contemporary and luxurious, but comfortable, feel of this hotel - it is Steadley at the front door, Kemal the front of the house manager, Gabe on the concierge floor and Tim with maintenance who have made this a home away from home. All have bent over backwards to develop a professional relationship with us - accommodating requests 'with pleasure'. While some of the room furnishings have become a bit worn, the rooms are very well kept and clean. The beds extremely comfortable, the sheets soft and extra pillows and blankets are provided in the closet. The Deluxe rooms are standard in size and the executive suites are apartment like with a separate living room and 1.5 bath. The large windows do open. The bathrooms luxurious with marble tiles/counter, separate shower and large deep tup. The towels are thick and soft. Note that we learned that the hotel will shortly be undergoing a soft renovation of all rooms and a full renovation of the lobby. This goes to show that the hotel is well aware of the need for new furnishings, the concierge desk is easily confused with the front desk, there is a lack of seating and the lobby offers a cold welcome. Although, as noted above, we have come to know the maintenance staff; that is not say that we are disappointed. Things go wrong, it's inevitable - it is how the 'wrong' is addressed. We have learned that Ritz staff are empowered to make decisions to resolve problems directly with the customer, ensuring that any problem can be addressed quickly and professionally. There appears to be little need for staff to haggle with management, those who work on the issue solve the problem directly (even financially). That's a great way of doing business. The concierge/club service is well worth the added expense if you plan to spend the day at / come back to the hotel. For example, we use the club room for doing business (wireless access included on floor 12), getting a cup of coffee and a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, lunch (it's an actual lunch in a bento box) and a glass of wine, cheese and desert after/before dinner - all without having to call, wait and sign for room service. It's the ease of having your own kitchen without the mess. Everything is ready, tasty and Gabe, the club concierge, is wonderful. With respect to room service, we would like to see an expanded room service menu. The menu is fairly limited and the restaurant (JerNe) does not appear to be all that interesting. The Ritz guests can take advantage of the LA Sports Club. The facilities are gorgeous and full service.

It is clearly a business traveler's hotel, but was aptly conducive to leisure travel like ours. The location is unbeatable, with quick access to the T and all of downtown. Kristen, who seemed to work everywhere (downstairs & club lounge) was one of the friendliest and most helpful members of this Ritz staff, definitely an asset to the hotel. As a discriminating traveler, I do not hesitate to give this location a five star rating.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fords, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cPutin' on the Ritz\u201d", "Author": "BigEandKenna", "ReviewID": "UR5430021", "Content": "A very nice hotel in a crummy area.

The only downside to this hotel is the neighborhood. Being a native New Yorker, cities don't scare me. But I was supprised at the amout of pan-hadling going on just steps from the front door.

The lobby is lovely and the staff was pleasant and helpful (this being Boston, no one is ever too solicitous).

We had planned this weekend getaway back in February, so we were all looking forward to it. There was 6 of us so we rented 2 ajoining rooms at the rate of $450/night/room. We stayed 2 nights so with taxes and parking charges we spent in total over $2000. All of us expected a certain level of service since we were staying at the Ritz, however this hotel certainly didn't meet what we would consider Ritz standards. The rooms were fine. They were clean with well appointed bathrooms, but nothing to get excited about. The service however was awful. The first night we were there, I made 20 calls to the bell man, before someone in hotel communications picked up the phone. Then on Saturday night before we left for dinner at 8:00, we requested to have extra hotels delivered to our room and our trash removed. When we returned at 11:30, neither request was fullfilled. I made another call to housekeeping and then finally things were taken care of. In my opinion, for the rates we were paying, we should have had nightly turn down service. I did speak with a manager when we checked out and he said he would make it worth our while to return, however all we received was a letter of apology. Needless to say, we have no plans to return to this hotel. My husband and I stayed at the Four Seasons Boston in February of 2005 and had a wonderful stay. The service there was impeccable as is service at all the Four Seaons that I have stayed at.

Very nice room. Nothing over the top though. It was a decent sizewith very comfy beds and nice linens. Foyer of this room was very large, seems like wasted space. Bathroom very nice separate bath and glass shower. View was a roof, with a few small bushes planted there to offset the drab view. My biggest problem was the use or non use of the pool. The pool is not for children under 18? Maybe it was 16. All I know is, the person in our family who would want to use the pool most is 7 and she was unable to. They do have family swim hours, two hours on Sunday. You could also pay for swimming lessons, that also gets your child in the pool. Last but not least, parking is aprox. $37 a night.

My side smelled so bad, if I were not that tired, I would have checked out. My husband side was ok. Furniture were old and cracked. It was obvious that upkeeping was not done well. There was no bath salt as used to be. They did not even replaced my shampoo. I had to call for extra soap for bath tub. One sign how bad hotel is doing is that their flagship Jer-ne restrurant is closed(!). It was an expensive but a beautiful restrurant. Now it is gone.
