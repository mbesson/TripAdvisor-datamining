I was in France for three weeks and came to Barcelona for a weekend. The rooms were enormous compared to the other hotel rooms I stayed at in France.

The breakfast was included in the price and was well suited for my needs. The paella was fantastic but I had to to convence like 3 employees to give it to me since I was only one (was really recommended for two, but I'm american and can handle it lol). The hotel is really close to the beach and the train station which was spectacular. The roof top pool and jacuzzis were awesome as well. I didnt actually get to go to the roof top bar when it was open, I dont know why tho.

We took a open top bus tour around the city \u20ac24 tickets available at the hotel, and pick up point just outside hotel, how ever i advise that you walk to La Rambla and get bus from there. (Basically theres a red line and a green line and the red line started in the city centre and had more points of intrest for us). Lovely resturants down by the port olympia. Also an all night casino ! Do not get excited if you have been to vegas its a major let down, but was a bit of fun, language barrier can be a problem! The hotel location was so central, the staff done everything possible to make our stay an enjoyable one, they all were so professional and have fantastic english. We stayed in a Junior Suite, room was fab, with an amazing bathroom with fab jacuzzi, and decoreted lovely however it appeared that they had forgot to either paint or walpaper one wall which was disapointing, i went to reception and they came straight up to the room to look, however it apperently is Japeanease feature !! Looked just unfinished, but staff were lovely about it! We went off for a walk and on return they had a bottle of chanpangue in the room and choclates, which was a lovely surprise! The room was complete as a five star should be with everything you would need for a short stay (tooth brush, tooth paste, shampoos, conditioners, body wash, body lotion, razors, shaving gels, and perfume). Breakfast was buffy style including, cereals, jucies, crossiants, various breads, platters of fruit and yogurts, hot buffy seletion also available ( far from an irish breaki ! but some may like it !! ). Breakfast was worth is however it set you up for the day. Hotel so accomadating we were allowed to check in early and had a lateflight home on the monday and got a late check out until 3pm. I would have thought all 5 star hotels would have a i-doc system for iphones/ipods in room, however not this one!! Reception were acomadaing and left an iphone charger in room when asked.

There's not as many sunbeds as guest, witch makes kind of an unpolite culture. Many guest are quite selfish, so often there are towels on all the beds while \"the owners of the towels\" are either sleeping or eating breakfast. Luckly there is one other pool, at the ground floor, and you also have 1 minute walk to the beach. The hotel is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. The rooms are great with good space and we got a nice view. The food tasted very good but is totally overpriced. Especially the breakfast - ridicolously expencive. I think it was about 250 norwegian kroner pr.p. With that said, I have to brag about the town. I really love Barcelona. It's one of my favourite places. It has EVERYTHING. I would recomend the sighseeing buses, witch you can hop on and off as you please. Sagrada Familia and La Pedrera (Gaudi's work) are among the most populare attractions in Barcelona. But be prepared for long queue. Casa Batllo and Casa Amatller both looks like they're made of sugar and is worth a look. Also the view from Museum National D'Art is stunning. Font Magica is worth a visit when the show is on - fantastic. We paid both the aqarium and the zoo a visit. In the zoo you get sea-lion- show and dolphin- show, witch I think is quite cute :) We also took a trip with a Katamaran (sailboat) and enjoyed the sight of Barcelona from a sea- perspective.

It certainly isn't cheap, but I doubt that this is the most important element that one looks for in the Pullman brand. On the other hand, it is no more expensive, and often cheaper than similar class hotels in Barcelona with less to offer. It is worth shopping around on the net for deals, but we got the best offer in direct correspondence with the hotel. So if accommodation is important to you, then splurge a bit on the Pullman Skipper - it's worth it. The hotel has everything going for it. It is a modern, very well kept property, with every amenity you could think of. It is located next to the wonderful Barcelona beachfront and within 20-25 minutes leisurely walk from the central tourist areas, either along the beachfront promenade or down the pedestrian friendly streets. If you're in a hurry, a mainline metro station as well as bus lines into the city are close by. The rooms are sumptuous and very spacious. We figured that 4 could easily sleep on the gargantuan and extra comfortable bed. Bathroom facilities are of the highest quality and as at all Pullmans the toiletries are the best. The staff is friendly and consistently helpful. A problem we had with the AC was attended to immediately and housekeeping had the bathroom (where the AC unit was accessed) re-cleaned as soon as the repairmen had left. The rooftop pool area was immaculate and has great views. While we were there some guests were \"horsing around\" and doing belly flops into the pool, splashing other guests. This is against the posted rules and it would have been better if a hotel staff member had intervened rather than leaving it to a guest to calm them down. One final comment, although the breakfast buffet was delicious and had a wide range of dishes available for every palate, there were no vegetables at all. We are aware of Spain's carnivorous orientation, but, at least for us, breakfast is not the same without fresh seasonal vegetables. Vegetables aside, the Pullman Skipper is a very good, highly recommended choice in Barcelona and we would definitely return.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ZIKHRON YAAKOV", "Title": "\u201cEXCELLENT\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR120159338", "Content": "Great hotel, nice staff and welcoming The room is neat and tidy, excellent bathroom Sure I get back in the future!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it was very good holiday!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Armagh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cnot as far out as i thought\u201d", "Author": "ArmaghApple", "ReviewID": "UR120078269", "Content": "pamper yourself - this hotel is beside the beach and beside bus and metro to take you into the centre. breakfast was excellent - very relaxed atmosphere. the bar in the evening was just as welcoming and relaxed for a drink after a day away. the rooftop pool and bar i did not sample as the weather was not up for it. the spa is worth a visit. good internet facailities. hotel caters for business and families.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aalst", "Title": "\u201cMissing some details to be very good\u201d", "Author": "kmeuleman Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR120044360", "Content": "As I usually visit accor hotels on my trips, I somehow had an expectation before entering the hotel.

After we had got pickpocketed at Passeig de Gracia metro station at 11pm, and somehow found our way back to the hotel, Luis was superb - he helped us to no end in canceling credit cards, sending a maintenance guy to break open the baggage lock at midnight (as the keys of this lock went with the wallet), etc. In short, he tried doing whatever he could to help make us more comfortable.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "37121", "ReviewID": "UR116109057", "Content": "My daughter and I visited Barcelona in early July and spent 5 nights at the Pullman Barcelona Skipper Hotel.

The breakfast was disgusting slimy smoked salmon, greasy inedible bacon, maybe powdered egg, toast was too thin and got stuck in toaster, we stuck to cornflakes and juice. They charge you five euro to bring ice to your room which we thought was outrageous. The aircon is pretty crappy.

The hotel is modern, comfortable, spacious and luxurious. My room had a nice divider between the bathroom corridor which meant that if someone was showering, you wouldn't necessarily hear it. The bed was totally comfortable and since I am allergic to feather bedding, I had it made up in hypoallergenic bedding, which went fine. Super-fluffy towels, a huge soaking tub, all sparkling clean. The soaps are kind of musky and not to my liking, but good quiality. A flat-screen TV with European and many American cable channels meant there was plenty of entertainment. You have to pay extra for wireless access, though, but chances are if you can afford to stay here, you're either not paying or can swing that fee yourself. The room is really well thought-out, plenty of closet space and a roomy bathroom and enough seating in the room so that you can relax and not just be either on the bed or sitting at the desk. The restaurant here is top-notch, a wonderful breakfast, a combination of delicious Catalonian/Spanish warm and cold items, as well as classical breads, jams, cheeses, and meats. Great coffee and tea; service is attentive. We had a working lunch meeeting one day and the food was really enjoyable. Service at the front desk was very helpful: I was busy and wanted to have theater tickets reserved, and the concierge handled this quickly and professionally. The location of this hotel, however, is a little out of the way of immediate tourist attractions, however, it is located on a street busy enough where it's easy to get a taxi, but not too busy so that it's noisy around the hotel. When you get directions to the metro, everyone at the front desk tells you \"it's behind that buiding over there\" and it kind of is, just not super obvious. No matter, it's a quick walk and while the neighborhood is not especially populated, it seems safe and is in walking distance to the seaside, a couple of toursity but decent restaurants, and a small place next door where you can get breakfast if you don't feel like what they offer in the Pullman Skipper restaurant. There's a pool that I never got to check out, and exercise facilities, too, but I got plenty of exercise walking around Barcelona and enjoying the city.

But the hotel experience itself was among the worst we had in a 2-week trip to Spain. The hotel bills itself as a 5-star hotel, but doesn't live up to the expectations. 5-star to me connotes amazing service, and the Pullman Skipper provided the worst service of our entire trip. When we arrived to check in (coming from the Hotel Miramar on Montjuic, which was amazing), we were informed that there was a problem with our reservation and that we were being moved to another 5-star hotel in the city center-- which was not why we had booked the hotel. It was the location on the beach that we wanted, and when we informed that man at the desk that we were unwilling to move, especially after we prepaid for the room, he got agitated and said he had to speak to someone in reservations. He walked away for over 10 minutes, during which time we watched at least 5 other guests check in without issues. Upon his return, he told us we would be able to stay there, but his demeanor and tone was not only rude, but condescending. The rooms are fine. Not 5-star quality, but fine. Our 2nd floor room was right over a busy highway and busstop, so it was incredibly noisy at night. (To contrast, we stayed in Plaza de Santa Anna in Madrid, one of the noisiest areas of the city, and the hotel had double-paned windows that led to some amazing sleep.) The shower leaked and the bathroom's strange layout made it tricky to share. The hotel wi-fi only works on one device at a time, meaning that we could only use one iPhone to check emails-- a huge misstep for a hotel that promotes itself as business-friendly and something we heard other guests complain about. And the front desk staff was continuously unhelpful-- the hotel directory indicated that they could point us to banks, but when we asked, they couldn't answer the question. The location is the only reason to book this hotel, as it was right on the beach and made that part of our trip enjoyable.

I'd done a lot of research on location and chose this hotel because it was close to a metro and we could be in Ramblas in about 10 minutes but without the noise of staying in town. Plus the hotel is 2 minutes walk to a super beach and the whole area around here in Port Olympic is full of all sorts of restaurants and bars from very typical Spanish ones in the older parts of town to super trendy bar/restaurants on the beachfront that are very reminiscent of South Beach in Miami. And it feels a whole lot more upmarket and secure than the downtown area. Service was superb from the moment of our arrival. The receptionist was very welcoming and helpful as was the bellman. We arrived early and our rooms were not ready but they stored our luggage, showed us where the pools were and where we could change and set up charging for us so that we could have food and drink. We found the rooftop pool to be extremely nice - no shortage of beds, plenty of shade and with a great couch lounging area too. The pool was just the right temperature. Our rooms (one classic, one superiour with balcony) were fabulous. Very large bathrooms with huge tubs, great shower and sinks, all super modern but very well done. The beds were very comfortable. All the towels including the pool towels were absolutely luxurious. The rooms had large flat screen tvs, tea and coffee facilities and a fridge. There was lots of storage. Wifi is available throughout the hotel and is free. In retrospect we would not bother with a superior room next time. There was no difference other than the balcony and really not worth any extra. My only gripe would be that the drinks around the pool were very expensive 4.50 euro for a coke etc but there was no objection to bringing up your own, there's a supermarket around the corner. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel, we got it at the cafe next door and it was very good. The beach was clean and well maintained and great for a swim. We ate at a very trendy place called CDLC on the beachfront in front of the hotel one night (sushi/fusion) and at a wonderful Spanish tapas restaurant about 10 minutes walk away called La Bombera too. We tried a couple of the club/bars - Opium, the Ice Bar and CDLC and they were all rather fab if a bit expensive ie 11 euro per drink. Still a great atmosphere and our older children (18 and 20) absolutely loved the area and we could relax knowing it was safe. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and we will undoubtedly be back. A small example of good service at the end: The bell captain hailed us a cab which had to be quite a large one to take 4 people and their post cruise luggage!!! He got us one and then loaded it with the taxi driver but there was a problem with the shelf in that it would not close with the shelf in place.

What a disappointment. The hotel building itself is very new and has a beautiful pool courtyard and a view of the ocean, a rooftop pool with bar (which I never saw open) and very modern rooms (with balconies). However there were various aspects that just do not live up to their 5-star rating. The chambermaids were rude and would knock and immediately open the door twice catching me in a state of undress - instead of apologising and leaving immediately on one occasion she stood with the door open and kept asking when I was going to leave so she could make up the room! On another occasion a maid opened the door and when I shouted that the do not disturb was on I had to deal with 3 maids holding up the do not disturb saying I had it the wrong way around... this didn't make sense as on both sides it indicated that they should not enter and there was a separate card for \"Please make up my room\". The bathroom was quite spacious and very modern. The only downside was that the shower and WC shared a common sliding door, which meant if one was in use the other could not be used. It also meant that once you had finished showering the water would run down the door and soak the floor. The breakfast was very disappointing. There was a decent selection of hot items but the pastries were a letdown. Overall the quality of the food didn't live up to expectations. The TV system in this hotel is not fit for purpose. The menu system is buggy and slow. On selecting a channel from the menu it would take you to another. A lot of channels were missing (just fuzzy/no signal), those channels we did have would 'skip' and the audio would chirp and pop making them unwatchable. Some channels were just not available (Sky News) - when I asked maintenance they just said it wasn't working and made no attempt to fix it. Most channels were German/Spanish. We were given complimentary WiFi but I do not know if this was due to the corporate booking. A username and password must be entered every time you connect which is annoying. The gym was abysmal. It's my understanding that it is being refurbished and so it's currently split over two guest rooms. It comprised of 1 set of rusty dumbells, one chest press, one leg extension, 2 benches, 2 treadmills (one out of order), one 'magnetic' cross trainer (no working display but useable), 4 bikes (all with broken or unchangeable seats making them unuseable). All of the machines had a home gym quality and were not what you would expect in a professional gym. Hopefully the new gym will be better. The hotel has a decent little business centre with 4 PCs, a Colour LaserJet, and Scanner. Printing is complimentary which was useful. As the hotel is on a busy road with only a small area for 2 cars to stop I found it very difficult to get taxis.

It has a business slant to it but would also be good for people holidaying as well. Getting There The cheapest way is to get a T10 ticket at the RENFE station (Spanish Rail) at the airport. This entitles you to 10 journeys of up to 1 hour 15 minutes on the train, metro and bus and any combination of those. You can also use it for more than one person, you just need to time stamp it for however many people you are using it for. It costs 7.30 Euros and available from the metro stations. A Barcelona Card also entitles you to free public transport and can therefore use the RENFE to get to the town. After landing pick up you bags and follow the signs for RENFE, then get the train to Passieg de Gracia. Trains run every half hour and journey takes 30 minutes. Transfer on to Line 4 to La Pau and get off at Cituadella del Villa Olimpic (about 4 stops). The metro isn't particularly lugagge friendly and the transfer to the metro involves a walk of about 10 minutes with some stairs. Exit the metro then look for the two big towers (these are very useful for finding the hotel). Head towards the tower on the right (Hotel Arts), and the Hotel Pullman Skipper is 50m to the right. The whole journey takes about 1 hour. Other options to get there from airport by public transport are the Aerobus (which is not included in a T10 ticket or Barcelona card)which will drop you off in Placa Catalunya and the regular bus service. The Room We booked through Expedia and got a special deal on a Superior room, however we were intially put in a Classic Room. The Classic Rooms have a 'city view' (i.e. the Ring Road) and no balcony. The hotel explained that the expedia bookings come through to them as a booking for a Classic Room so be aware of this. They were happy to change our room when we showed our booking. I would definately recommend the Superior Rooms. We staying in one that faced the sea and which meant the balcony got a lot of sun in the morning. In the hotter months it might be better to stay in the east facing rooms as their balconies were shaded. The sea facing rooms were numbered 27-45 and the east facing 1-26. You'll only see the sea if you're on the fourth floor or above and the hotel has six floors. The grounds are very stylish and a pleasure to look at from the balcony. The bathroom was clean and spacious with a separate shower and large bath. A Flat Screen TV with some English channels and DVD player that will also play CDs are provided. The TV can be played through speakers in the bathroom. The Hotel also has a DVD rental facility. Location It is located in the Port Olimipic area about 100m from the beach. There are plenty of trendy bars/clubs around which double up as fancy restaurants e.g. Shoko, the ICE bar, Opium bar and CDLC as well as the more cheesy row of bars/clubs/restaurants in the port itself. The old town is about 15 mins walk away if you take the direct route past the gasnatural (butterfly) tower and a leisurely 30 minute stroll if you walk along the seafront and through Barcelonetta. All the main tourist attractions in Barcelona are spread evenly throughout the city and can be accessed easily by bus/metro but I recommend walking if you have the time. Check out the Parc de la Cituadella. The Zoo there is also worth a visit. The metro stop (Cituadella del Villa Olimpic) is 5 mins walk away and is on the line to barcelonetta (if you're lazy). A supermarket can be found in a shopping centre about 10 mins walk away in \"El Centro de la Villa\" on Google Maps. There is a cafe next door to the hotel which does breakfasts + sandwiches etc. Other facilities in the Hotel It has a gym and spa (which weren't open when we stayed, check the hotel website for more details) and 2 pools, one on the roof which is open all year round and slightly heated. There's also a jacuzzi on the roof. The main pool in the centre of the hotel is outdoor and open in the summer. The Syrah restaurant is open all day and is where you have your breakfast. Breakfast is good but nothing particularly special. We didn't eat there for lunch/dinner but reviews suggest the food good but the atmosphere is lacking. The bar is expensive for spirits (12 euros a time ouch) but you can get a beer for 4.50 and a glass of cava for 4.50. Room service has a minimum 5 euro charge as well. Wireless internet is also free throughout the hotel and is reasonably speedy Overall Would definately stay at this hotel again.

The hotel at checkout tried charging us for minibar but we had not used it then amazingly refunded that back to us..sneaky! remember to take your paperwork as they claimed my room was not paid for upfront when it had been and eventually they realised i had paid for my room. We flew into Girona which is about 1hr 15 min out of Barcalona the bus was 20 euros into town and then we took a taxi again go with a metered taxi as its the safest option and cheapest.

We have over the years done all the touristy stuff, Les Ramblas, Gothic area, all the museums etc etc, so a 5 day break just chilling was a change for us. The Pullman AB Skipper Hotel is idea to do this at. From the initial greeting at the front desk to our departure the staff were superb. They could not do enough for you. The rooms are superb & extremly clean. The pool areas & bars are kept imaculate & clean. There is never a time when the staff are not tidying up around the sun loungers. We really liked the Attic pool on the roof. Someone commented on the drinks being pricey, but to be honest it is just hotel prices & nothing REALY steep. The hotel is around 100mtrs from the front & you really cannot find a better hotel to chill out at. There are numerous restuarants & cafes in the area. Again slightly more expensive that the city back street outlets, but we found the food superb. We were taken with the food at one of the restuarants so much we returned the next night as the food was the best we had had in the city. \"LA BARCA DEL SALAMANCA\" It is situated in the Port Olympic Marina on the ground floor on the left hand side facing the sea. As for shops in the area they are scarce for everyday things. If you need papers, water,beer etc the only shop we found was also at the marina. Up the escalator onto the 1st floor beside GINOS Restuarant. We love Barca so we will be back again for sure. We will also be back at the AB Skipper Hotel.

It is truly a very nice hotel, but had some shortcomings for a true 5-star hotel. To sum up, if you are looking for a plush modern hotel with amenities near the water, then the Skipper is a good choice. However, if you are seeking a completely stress-free, no hassle, luxurious 5-star hotel (especially for the price), then I might look around a bit more until the Skipper fixes some of its teething problems. We were greeted by a young British girl who presumably deals with the English speaking guests. While very friendly, her way of highlighting the hotel's advantages was a bit odd, to say the least. Rather than pointing out local sights, restaurants, or transport, etc, she instead rhapsodised about the 'brilliant blow dryer' in the room, and pointed out in some detail the rather obvious features of the room (eg. 'this is a TV, this is the air conditioning). Gee, really? It would have been far more useful if she had instead pointed out that the taps in the sink would, without fail, splash a load of water all over the floor every time they were used. Or that sometimes there would be no hot water in the tub. As some previous reviewers have pointed out, you will need to read the guide to operate the tub! I will say that the shower itself was great, with good water pressure for Europe, even if it did leak all over the floor whenever used. The room itself was really nicely appointed - a big bed, comfy chairs/sofa, adequate desk, fully loaded minibar, loads of storage space, and we had a great view into the city. Lots of toiletries, although the very anti-environmental plastic packaging on every single product was a bit overkill. There is a snazzy coffee machine and kettle in the room, with lots of coffee and teas to choose from. I ordered room service for a late afternoon snack and the food was delicious. However, we found so many little things to be a bit annoying, which added up to a somewhat bigger annoyance. For example: - The bank of light switches for the suite gives no indication of what switch controls what light, and you will invariably wind up turing them all off and on several times before finding the right one. Not a big deal, but annoying if one of you is trying to sleep, and the other is flashing lights on and off in an attempt to find the bathroom light. - There is a pillow menu in the room from which you can choose various types of pillows. A neat idea, and one that we took advantage of. After a night sleeping on my selected pillow, I decided that it didn't really work for me (but fun to try), only to realise that the maid had taken away my original pillow! I had to call housekeeping to have one of the original pillows delivered to the room. Not the end of the world, but I would have rather been sleeping than waiting up for a new pillow to be delivered to the room. - There are menus all over the room, listing things the hotel can provide: food, drinks, baths, pillows. However, the housekeeping/front desk numbers don't seem to appear on them or anywhere near the phone, so you will have to go thumbing through the hotel guide just to find the extension you are looking for. - The card key for our rooms did not work on a couple of occasions, so be sure to have a spare one on hand when you go out. - The 'do not disturb' sign was ignored on several occasions. I was awoken once, notwithstanding the do not disturb sign hanging on the door, while having a nap to have chocolates delivered to my room! Really, I could have waited. The next day, one of the maids proceeded to clean the bathroom while my husband was sleeping in the bed - he woke up rather surprised, to say the least! Conversely, we put out the sign to have the room made up for several hours in the morning, but when we came back to the hotel mid-afternoon, nobody had heeded it. - The bar in the lobby turns off the lights in the adjacent bathrooms during the afternoon. While I applaud their efforts at not wasting electricity, there does not seem to be any way to turn the light on if you need them! There are no motion detectors or switches that I could find at all, and I wound up actually cutting my hand on something while groping around in the dark. Very unpleasant. As the Skipper is situated next door to a hospital (and a medical centre with groovy architecture), the sound of ambulances can be heard constantly throughout the day and night. If you are not already a 'city sleeper', then a pair of earplugs would not go amiss. Of course, this is no fault of the hotel, but be forewarned. So, enough with the complaints. On the plus side, the location is great if you want to be near the waterfront. I went for a run next to the beach in the morning, and it was just beautiful. You can walk to the bars and restaurants of El Borne (if you are accustomed to walking - it might be a bit far otherwise). However, the Olympic tube stop is just a 5 minute walk away and will take you wherever you want to go without hassle. Watch out for pickpockets! As a side note, Villa Vinteca in the Borne is a fantastic wine shop with a huge selection for reasonable prices - you can go very inexpensive or break the bank, but they really know their stuff. There is a secluded little spot on the first floor of the hotel (2nd floor if you are coming from the US), around the corner to the right when exiting the lifts. It has lots of cozy chairs and a selection of reading magazines and books for browsing. A good place to chill for just a bit if you don't feel like sitting in your room or at the bar. If it's warm, head outside though! The staff that we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Clearly, none of the above are enough to rule out staying at the hotel completely. It is pretty swish, in a modern minimalist way. And I will caveat that all of the above bothered me more than my husband, so who knows, you may think it's perfect!

Likewise, the bathtub, outfitted with the same oh-so-sleek system, was a puzzle. We had to call down to the front desk to seek help with getting hot water. And in the end, it was not very hot - there is apparently some scald control built in, and I like my baths hot, but...And the shower leaked all over the floor each time, right into the toilet floor area. And the lighting, well, it makes you look positively cadaverous. The sink is trough-like and shallow, and the faucet controls reminded me of stick-shifts with no indicators. Much water was sprayed in all directions in trying to adjust them. It was all actually pretty humorous but I felt sorry for housekeeping, having to mop up so much water every day. So the bathroom was very sleek-looking but not the most functional/practical we've ever encountered. The bed was very comfortable. The noise level for us was pretty high as we were closest to the hospital nearby. Sirens at night, but we got used to it. Maid service was just fine. We and many of the attendees we were with had repeated trouble with their room key cards failing. We swapped ours out for new ones about 4 times. We ate only in the bar (not restaurant) area a couple times, and here's a tip - if you aren't interested in the five or so sandwiches etc. that they offer, just ask them to make up a plate of tapas. A much better deal, better food. For some very good and inxpensive sandwiches, soups, salads, just head to the beachfront - there's a very pleasant indoor/outdoor cafe/sandwich place nearish the casino (stay away from the casino, a rip-off) And there along the beachfront we also recommend Agua, a restaurant apparently quite popular with the locals. (Try the three-cheese risotto - to die for. ) The conference facilities were good and the free Internet on business pcs there was nice. Elevators were fast. Having been in Barcelona only once, I probably would try somewhere else on a 2nd trip, if only to see something new, not because our stay at the AB Skipper was negative. It was very nice, on the whole.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cFantastic weekend in a 5 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "PJBManchester", "ReviewID": "UR10425250", "Content": "We have just returned from a two night stay (26/27 Oct) at this fantastic hotel.

Location is a little weird, as you are out of the main action of Barcelona. There is a metro stop about 5 minutes away, and the beach is right there. Also if you are looking for cheesy touristy nightlife, the main spot for dancing and eating Pizza hut is right down the beach. There are two pools, we tried to go into one but it was too cold in September! I'm sure it's lovely in the summer though. We did go into the hot tub, although I hesitate to call it that, it was lukewarm at best. The room was nice and comfy, with a HUGE bed. Very modern looking, flat screen (with only 3 English speaking channels). The bathroom was a little too modern actually, it took me about a minute to find the toilet! The weirdest thing about the room was the windows, they were partially blocked out, so we couldn't really see out of them, even though the view was not much, just into the biotech centre across the way (people working in there would wave at us when we waved at them, so maybe that's why the widows are only partially glass, for privacy). Breakfast was nice, but not worth the 50 Euro. For that kind of money, I'd expect a feast for a king, but not so. I was upset, as a vegetarian to find ham in my eggs while I was eating them. Not a big deal, but there were only one kind of egg! For 50 Euro you'd think they'd have several dishes to choose from.....

I booked a Delux room direct with the hotel as part of a surprise 40th birthday present for my girlfriend. I mentioned on the booking Comments that it was a birthday surprise and wanted a room on an upper floor with a sea view. Upon arrival the we were greeted by Olga at reception who spoke excellent English and was very friendly. She informed us that we had been upgraded to a superior room, located on the sixth floor with a sea view. Good start!. Room was the best I've ever stayed in: spacious, modern, great view of the beach and sea, huge king-sized bed, bathroom with jacuzzi, separate shower and seperate toilet, all the necessary toiletries you could wish for etc etc. We spent the first day on the roof terrace with pool, chilling out after an early morning flight. I won't go into detail but it was faultless. Early evening we received a complimentary bottle of Cava, which was a nice touch. On the day of my girlfreinds birthday we returned to our room about 6 to find Room Service had dressed the bed and jacuzzi with rose petals. I'm not one to normally write reviews, but this hotel made, what would have been a great stay anyway, a very special stay. They also booked some great restaurants for us. The Lomja De Tapas, in the Born district, great tapas and unpretentious. Birthday meal was at the Torre D'alta mar - sits at the top of Torre de San Sebastian which is a cable car tower and has 360 panaoramic views of Barcelona 75 metres up. Top class with top class prices, but a \"special occassion\" restaurant. Enough said.

Breakfast was included and the overall choices and quality were very high. The hotel was very clean and quiet. We had a king bed which was very comfortable.The TV in the room had several English language stations, including CNN.Our room was close to the street but we were not disturbed at all at night.The air conditioning worked very well, which is importanat in the Barcelona summer. The hotel has 2 nice size pools with an ample number of avaialble sun beds. There is an area with 4 computers with free internet access in the level below the main lobby. The only issue that we had was that the shower was slow to drain. We needed a taxi van to the airport so we spoke to the front desk clerk the night before our departure. He arranged for it and it was waiting for us the next morning at the time that was arranged. We considered the AB Skipper and the Hotel Arts for our stay.
