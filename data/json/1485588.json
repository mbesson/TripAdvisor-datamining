The apartment is well maintained, clean, very good furnishings and most of all the bed and linen are very good and comfortable. The only issues we faced is the toilet flush which you need to flush two times get everything down and the other thing is the very strong water pressure in the lavatory which nearly soaked my mobile phone in my waist when I first opened the tap. Location is very good since its very near to the Yau Ma Tei metro station. Like what other people mentioned in their reviews, there are lots of cheap eateries around the apartment but I don't suggest them because most of the food are greasy and heavily soaked in oil. The other thing I did not like is that one week before our stay, I received an email from the Chi management telling us that we were upgraded to another apartment which is Chi 120 in Sheung Wan, Hong Kong island. It felt like they just wanted to move us to one of their apartments to give way to their other customers (maybe for a higher rate). I declined the offer since we have no plans in staying in the Hong Kong side.

Trying to find a place that is not too tight for US standard, and doesn't cost you an arm and a leg - no easy task. We are very satisfied with this apartment. We got a room for 3 people and requested an additional bed. Our room has 1 double bed and a twin size bed in another room. The added bed was squeezed in between the double bed and the TV. Without the added bed, it's a very good size room for 3 people. It's a bit tight for 4 people, but we managed. The bathroom is spacious and we can store all of our luggages in a spare space in the bathroom. Staff is very friendly, contrast to most people in HK. They also speak good English. When we arrived, they knew us by names and welcomed us warmly. The security is pretty good. This is not a hotel where there is lobby area. It's a serviced apartment. So you have to ring the bell to get in. We feel very safe. The room is also very quiet. They also stored our luggages on the day we checked out until we are ready for the airport. The location is super convinient. An airport bus is just 2 blocks away. The bus runs every 10 minutes for $33 HKD each person. We took the taxi because we have 4 people. Taxi is about $220 HKD from the airport. The Yau Ma Tei MTR station (subway) was just about 5 minutes away and it has trains to all the major sites. You can get an Octopus card. You need to put in $150 in total minimum - $50 deposit and $100 to use for almost all the public transportation, including the airport bus. (Airport train is very expensive) You can add more money to the card in any of the subway stations, or in any 7/11 stores. You can also use it in many store, like McDonald, 7/11. When you return it, you will get the deposit back plus any unused balance. But they charge $HK9 if you return within 3 days, which is just a little over US$1. The famous night market \"Temple Street\" is just one block away. We had a lot of fun going through the night market. You can get really local food if you are brave enough. It may not look that clean, but we didn't get sick at all. Lots of shopping around. We went to the Peak at night. Beautiful. It's a must see in HK if you are there for a limited time.

The apartment was spacious as advertised and extremely clean. It's also very well located as others have mentioned, two blocks to MTR and a McDonalds and Welcome supermarket one block away. The Temple Street Market is one short block away. In all it's a great location and a wonderful room. But it's not a hotel. No on-site restaurant, but the McDonalds is closeby for quick coffee and breakfast. As the Yau Ma Tei Metro Exit C is just a couple blocks away, transport to fancier restaurants is easy. Also, there are dozens of small restuarants all around the location and Temple Street Market has the street side table restaurants. You can get dim sum there in the evening and morning as well. Beware there is only a single bed in the room, so if you need twin beds, it could be a problem. I had noted this specifically on the reservation which they had a copy of. They wanted to charge me 200 HKD surcharge for twin beds instead of a queen. In the end it was complimentary, but the room was really geared to two people sharing a bed. They just put a roll-away in the living room. There's a couch too. So I rated the service a three star, but it's not because the service that's provided is bad. It's just there isn't really the normal kind of service you might expect in any kind of hotel setting. The desk closed at 6:00 pm the day I was there. They came back for our late arrival from the airport (I had to pick my mom up) by special arrangement, but if you were to arrive late or leave early, you need to make arrangements. The manager was very helpful and friendly though. Took our picture and helped out. You get a full kitchen, but there is zero food service on site of any kind. So you must go out as mentioned above. The ultra cleanliness of the room is really nice. Top notch. For a serviced apartment, with no hotel services, this is a great place. p.s.

The triple room has a queen bed plus one single bed in another \"wing\" type of configuration. for the price we paid, the room is huge by hong kong standards. This is more like a serviced apartment which allows daily stay, rather than a hotel, hence this might explain the difference in size. That said, don't expect hotel cosyness or decor too. This is more functional, homelike and is clean and tidy. Service is fantastic too considering we aren't thrilled about our experience with other Hong Kong service people! from the friendly office mgmt to housekeeping staff, they are smiley and helpful. toilet is a bit too big and empty (rather the space goes into the room), but is ok. toilet/kitchenette fittings are grohe, so it's good stuff even though the overall decor may not feel so. Flat screen TV is great too! Location wise, it is a short walk to Yau Ma Tei station, so it's pretty convenient. and it's just a short walk away to Temple St night market too. Actually just a block away there is already a smaller night market which is like an \"extension\" to the Temple St one, but on Yau Ma Tei side. My family have even walked to Mong Kok / Langham Place / Women st market area twice, not that far away. TST to our hotel is a bit further but we did that walk too, passing through Temple St along the way. One downside is that from the main entrance to the lift, there is a flight of stairs to negotiate. luggage is still ok, cos there's a small lift that is meant for wheelchairs that can take the luggage, but you need the hotel staff to activate for you I think. so for daily use, it's up and down the stairs we went with our baby stroller.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gawler, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value Apartment\u201d", "Author": "TimAus", "ReviewID": "UR119582597", "Content": "We arrived at Chi Residences after travelling from Hanoi and 3 weeks into our trip.

Knowing that the room size in HK hotels tend to be small, once you put in an extra bed there wouldn't be much place to walk about or put luggage. CHI 279 is actually a block of serviced apartments, but I think they rent out the lower floors on a daily rate. Our triple room had a partition which could be closed to separate the extra bedroom from the main room, and it was a read bed and not a foldable or sofa bed. So the bed was quite firm and comfortable. The bathroom was over-large, with a 'wasted' corner space behind the handrails. The size of the shower stall was also too big, and maybe it was intended for a bathtub but become a shower stall. There was a great contrast between the street scene outside and in the room. When the taxi first dropped us off there were some reservations, as the street was quite noisy and not so clean. But it was a world of difference once entering the hotel, and the interior renovations was marvellous. There was free internet and WiFi on the room TV, if you didn't bring your laptop along. The noise from traffic outside was minimal, even though we were on a low floor. One downside was the absence of a writing table.

Pros: cleanliness, free WiFi, proximity to night markets, good local restaurants and 2 7Eleven's within 100mtrs, easy to get taxi at front door, Nathan Rd 200mtrs away, price - HKD1000 a night, accessible roof - most guests made use of this space to relax and have drinks in the evening. Cons: taxi drivers had trouble finding the complex, apartments are very small but well designed, no lift from street level to lobby - but have a porter to carry luggage, sent several emails to the main CHI office which has still not been responded to. The location of the hotel was good - it is away from the main tourist areas which is a good and bad point. There is a guest laundry on the roof. Overall, a good apartment for the price that offered slightly more space than a hotel room.", "Date": "October 31, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "CHI Residences 279", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1485588-Reviews-CHI_Residences_279-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$160 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.279 Shanghai Street,Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1485588", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3a/a1/3aa18e87b417826b9ffdb7528ea8d04f2large.jpg"}}
