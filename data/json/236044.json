It was clean and warm, and convenient for the area I needed ( Dam Square) but I am pretty sure I could find much better for the price or a little extra. No breakfast, the smallest shared shower I have ever seen (you literally have about 5 inches of wriggle room before your clothes and towel get wet and you get scalded or frozen in the spray) and it is entirely characterless. This is a budget hotel that doesn't even try. The reception is held in someones bedroom/living room, which isn't a great first impression.No TV, no kettle and curtains that let the light in from the main drag if my room is anything to go by, with some rumbling trams. You get a complimentary soap that smells like carbolic and a plastic cup for your toothbrush. I agree, it can be seen as a great budget hotel, and it is not awful, but my advice is to shop around, and be willing to pay a little extra for the extras than can make budget hotels in the city really good, like 24 hour reception, great breakfasts and friendly, funky staff.

The hotel is brilliantly located with a supermarket a block away and 5 minute walk from Dam Sq. It's true - the stairs are not suitable for elderly or frail travellers or if you travel with substantial luggage. However, this is clearly mentioned on all blogs and hotel reviews. The owner/landlord is great - always friendly and smiling and welcomes you to his home and city. This is a family run business and it does feel like it.

No problem leaving luggage after checkout until leaving the city at the hotel. Free wifi Clean. Smoke free - at least that's what the owner said , other review here state otherwise. Location is great. Disadvantages: Entrance to the hotel is a very very steep staircase, getting to rooms on top floor is 71 stairs. Read about this before but I didn't believe it would be so crazy but - it is the steepest staircase I have seen in my life and getting a suitcase up the stairs to the top floor is a total body workout. 1 light bulb for the whole room - not very helpful - had to keep bathroom door open so light would come in. there was a tiny reading light above a sort of shelf. Double beds are small and seperated (twin) so don't plan on rolling to your partners bed in the middle of the night ...... No desk or anything of the sort. NO air\\con or safe. No breakfast option. The men at the front counter are nice (Esam and an older man were there at the time) and helpful with travel tips around the city. With all the positive reviews I though maybe it would still hold a certain standard but would recommend this hotel for people on a very tight\\nonexistent budget or students or someone who simply has no other choice .

We were in Europe on vacation for one month and Amsterdam was our last destination before returning home. Unfortunately what eventuated upon our arrival was straight out of a bad dream.

The owner was quick to shift the blame to me for not calling ahead and confirming the booking, I advsied him that I very rarely call ahead to confirm bookings once I have received an email confirmation that I can present upon arrival. I advised him that I had already provided him with my email address and mobile phone number but he said all this information had been lost in the computer crash and therefore was unable to contact me. However, the owner did make an attempt to accommodate us and offered us a quad room with NO private bathroom facilities and one twin room with private facilities but could only offer this for the first night. On the second night he said that we would need to vacate the quad room and move to a triple room with facilities. We were told that on the third night he could not offer us anything and that we would need to go elsewhere. The owner went as far as showing us the rooms. He took us up a second flight of steps and proceeding to show us the accommodation, surprisingly the rooms were occupied but he had no hesitations in opening the doors and letting us in for a viewing. Guest luggage and personal belongings were still in the rooms, we found this a bit unsettling and decided at that point that we would go elsehwhere altogether and promtly left the premises. Not only were we disappointed with the obvious lack of respect for privacy on the owner's behalf but also the facilities, the shared toilet and shower were two seperate converted closets in the hallway. When we questioned the owener about the apparent lack of cleanliness he said that he cleaned the property himself so everything was clean. We ended up staying at the Hotel Ambassade for three nights, and because it was mid week the Hotel Ambassade offered us a reduced rate so we only ended up paying a fraction more than we would have. Hotel Ambassade was superb! As the saying goes \"you get what you pay for\" so we should not have been surprised at the short comings of Hotel Aspen. Next time we will certainly think twice before booking at such a low budget Hotel (with no computer backups in case of a hard drive crash).", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rome", "Title": "\u201cpleasant stay.\u201d", "Author": "Roberto84", "ReviewID": "UR24599663", "Content": "good location, really clean.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cCentral location\u201d", "Author": "Afrando", "ReviewID": "UR23533333", "Content": "Stayed in a twin room with bathroom which was basic but clean.

One recommendation might be to provide plastic cups that are wrapped in plastic instead of unwrapped plastic cups being left in the bathroom. With that said I would still happily stay at Hotel Aspen again and will recommend it to others (who are fit and healthy to cope with the stairs) as the price and location outweighed anything that might have been negative. There is a fairly large grocery store on the corner near the hotel so a great place to stock up on water and snacks, which will help to save money.

Only needing a single room, I was more than happy to opt for a low cost option, and the Hotel Aspen was one of the few affordable choices in a good, central location. The Hotel Aspen is basically a converted house. The owners live in a tidy and compact room that doubles as the check-in area. The owner makes you feel quite welcome and makes the check-in process smooth. You are provided with two keys, one for the outside door and the other for your room. That is nice since you do not have to worry about reclaiming your key every time you walk back into the hotel. My room was very, very simple. The side table could best be described as a very short stool. There was a modern (Ikea-like) wardrobe. Otherwise, not much else. The bed was borderline comfortable. There was a shared bathroom for my room category which was rather rough. The shower was separate from the toilet and basically was a small closet with a sliding door. It was very, very difficult to get into the shower without having water go everywhere. So, I ended up walking around with a small towel around me to go use the shower. No big deal for me, but I cannot imagine my wife finding that particularly acceptable. Of course, one could always get a higher room category with an ensuite bathroom. The Hotel Aspen is well-located near Dam Square. It is maybe a five minute walk to Dam Square and all the fun nearby. The public transportation system runs right by the Hotel and can get you anywhere in Amsterdam fairly quickly. The noise from the streets was a little more than I would have liked, but it was not that bad. A full-service grocery store was nearby (just off of Dam Square) and very good.

The hotel's location seemed central to everything you'd want to do & see in Amsterdam. My room was clean and well-lit, and just the right size for a single traveller. The shared bathroom was cleaned continuously throughout the day. All the staff were very nice & helpful and the owner was an incredibly nice man who was always there with a smile and a friendly greeting. I highly recommend staying at this hotel if you want a great value in Amsterdam. When I return to Amsterdam in spring 2006, I will certainly stay at the Hotel Aspen.", "Date": "October 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "mgt715", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "mgt715", "ReviewID": "UR3915458", "Content": "Excellent rooms and service for a budget hotel. The staff was very accomodating, helpful and friendly. We had a group of 7 people and stayed in 2 doubles and a triple at the beginning of September for 3 nights.

You can't get a better location than this. Dam Square (what I consider to be in the middle of everything) is just a couple of blocks away. The street car goes right past the front of the hotel (which can be a bit noisy if staying in the front side of the hotel with the windows open). There were quite a few stairs, but not so bad after you don't have your luggage with you. We had backpacks, so not a problem for us at all, just take them slow. Overall a great experience.

At the Aspen, you get the added bonus of Esam, the proprietor, who is always willing to offer restaurant and transportation suggestions as well as the weather forecast, maps, and umbrellas. Quite the character! The hotel is walking distance to Centraal Station and all of the major sights. My room was tiny but spotless, and the shared bathroom and shower were literally right outside my door (and never once occupied when I needed it). I was also rather giddy to discover that I had my very own gargoyle just outside the window.
