During Sept. 2011 we spent two glorious nights in room 210 which overlooks the Pantheon Plaza. The room was incredible, very large, great bed, ornate ceiling, great marble bathroom, sitting area,.......... The arched windows looked out onto the plaza. After a day of touring the major sites which are walking distance and feasting at the great restaurants in the nearby plazas, we retired to our room. There we opened the windows and let the sounds of Rome pour in! Incredible singers took turns at the fountain in our plaza. The quality was incredible. One gentlemen sang Andrea Bocelli's Con te Partiro (time to say goodbye). It was magical. Rome is a romantic city, but, my wife and I found this hotel to be the epitome of romantic. We found all of the staff very helpful. A delicious hot breakfast was served in an open interior courtyard. We travel extensively and this hotel remains one of our favorites.

Great cuisine is Armando al Pantheon, rightside around the corner of the Pantheon, rightside of Pantheon is the Cremeria, small ice-creamshop with the best of the best, for your daily ice-cream. Great is the pizza in La Sagretia (from the hotel, 2 street at your left). Don't go to the Pummarola & drink (on the corner of the Via del Maddalena), it's a tourist-trap. For your daily cappuccino to Pastuccini, Via di Torre Argentina (just around the corner of Feltrinelly). They serviced the best cappuccino. Don't do that in front of the church SantaMaria Maggiore, AnticoCaffe SantaMaria, the 2e touristtrap, especially the prices on the terrace. Wanna sightseeing on budget? Take bus 116, small bus on electra, busstop near restaurant La Sagretia an brings you through the gardens of Villa Borghese to Spanish Steps, Via Veneto etc. At the end of our 4-daytrip, we took a taxi from the hotel, (not the white-ones at the rightside of Pantheon, but a Mercedes E-class) Leonardo the portier made the reservation and we were in 40 minutes time at the airport (costs 55,- euro).

The public areas of the hotel have been renovated to a high standard, in keeping with its statement as being the oldest hotel in Rome, however I am not able to comment on the rooms as, on arrival, we were re-located to one of several apartments the hotel owns a few minutes away just off the piazza. The apartment we stayed in was located on the 5th floor and actually getting into it was our first challenge as the keys to the entrance grille and main door seemed happy to spin around for 5 minutes without opening the door; whilst at the same time the lights kept going off leaving us waving franticly to switch them back on. The apartment itself was large by city standards. The living room, with sofa bed, acted as the second bedroom for our son during our stay. Off this was a dressing/closet area which led to the main bedroom and en-suite bathroom (which are the only facilities in the room and can only be accessed by walking through the bedroom). The apartment was very dark and very dated - in terms of facilities offered there were two flat screen TVs in the bedroom and living room, a coffee machine, room safe (with the same challenging key arrangements as the main doors) and a radio. There was no wi-fi (which is becoming increasingly expected) and whilst there was a tired jacuzzi bath the only shower arrangements were via a hand held attachment to the taps. We did have problems during our stay with the bathroom - no hot water one evening (but which was remedied straight away when we pointed it out) but there was an unpleasent smell for the duration of our stay and we needed to keep the window open and door closed. We found our bed to be very comfortable, mattress a little hard but we prefer it that way. Based on other places we have stayed the apartment cannot be rated any higher than a 2* and was a real disappointment. The one plus point, and for us it is a big one, is the view. Off the living room accessed through another grille and window/door is a very small balcony (three people standing front to back) however if faces straight out over the Piazza della Rotonda and the Pantheon itself. We were able to spend evenings people watching as the square is filled with activity and entertainment - just need to move the ariel mast as it prevents that perfect picture! Breakfast is taken in the main hotel and consists of a cold buffett of meats, cheeses, breads/pastries and fruit juice/coffee. Whilst not extensive it is just right and sets you up for the day. The hotel itself has no restaurant facilties however you are never short of places to eat in Rome though you certainly have to pay a premium if you choose to eat in one of the main Piazzas. Service from the staff was excellent at all times. In summary, as the review title suggests, a 5* location but only 2* accommodation.

When we left the hotel and mentioned we were returning soon the man at the check out said 'next time we will see if we can get you a better room'.

You are right opposite the Pantheon - absolutely stunning! HOWEVER - and this is a big however, we are sorry to report many unacceptable aspects. 1. We booked the Ariosto suite several weeks in advance, plus a double room for the children. In addition, I telephoned the hotel to double check the booking (I'd seen a couple of comments on Trip Advisor from guests who had not been given the suite they'd reserved). It was important that we had this suite, as my husband needed the space and comfort to work, while the rest of the family went out doing the sights. However, on arriving, we were told that the Ariosto was 'not available'. We were given another dark, interior suite for the first night, and told that we could have the 'luxury' suite in the annexe the following night. But it turned out that this second, luxury suite did not have internet access, so in the end, the children took this suite, and we took the double room no 108 from the second day of our stay. 2. The airconditioning in 108 did not work. Temperatures were about 35 degrees, and my husband needed to stay in the room to work during the day. We were assured that it was being/would be fixed. Throughout the remaining 3 days of our stay it was never fixed. 3. The bathrooms in the main building were extremely small, and in bad condition. There was mould around several fittings, toilet seats were broken, shower curtains were highly suspect.

Yes, crowded, touristy and not cheap - but easy access to everywhere, never more than a few minutes to find a cab and never a lack of people-watching or a place to eat or drink. With that in mind the Sole Al Pantheon seemed to meet our needs. Strike one, however, not made clear on its website, is that there is no direct auto access - taxis can get within about 100 yds, and then you need to walk across the crowded cobbled square with your suitcases. A minor challenge for the young and hale, a tad unpleasant if raining - but could be a real obstacle for anyone at all infirm. You might be able to pay your cabby to linger while you dash to the hotel and hope a bellman is available to come and fetch your luggafe. Anyway, that is a caveat of which to be aware. Second, the male desk staff seems to resent being disturbed by guests. Arrogant deliberate attitude is their forte. \"Yes yes yes\" said dismissively does not mean the request made will be looked after. I was lied to blatantly about the fan I had requested having been put \"by accident\" in my cousin's room (who was asleep). In fact no fan had been put in hers or mine. The website advertises a/c but it is not turned on until summer - meanwhile my small (though comfortable) single turned quite hot - and my anger at coming in after dinner to find no fan was not alleviated when the better-mannered but not terrifically savvy (female) desk clerk took me on a late night walk to their \"annexe\" to see if I found the one vacant room any cooler (it wasn't). She claimed there was only one fan in the entire hotel. To her credit, an hour later she had borrowed one (which worked briefly) from another hotel - so she said. Anyway the whole episode was absurd for a supposedly 4 star hotel and left a bad taste in my mouth. I noticed the rude young man (about whom I spoke to the male manager who seemed to care less) could not meet my eyes when we checked out the third morning. Against that, the rooms are clean, the bathrooms spacious and everything works though it takes a while to rustle up the hot water (again, management purports to be amazed at the problem but others have reported it too on this and other sites); the buffet breakfast was tasty with lots of choice and pleasant service if you wanted eggs or tea, etc ; the bellboys extremely nice and willing. There is a large sized lounge for guests to use. And there is an archaic - but FREE - internet access via your TV which will drive any N American mad until you figure its quirks. It is useless for anything much more than checking emails - but if that saves you lugging around a laptop (it did me) then it is a plus.

The obvious plus is the location - an easy walk to all the main tourist attractions in Rome, a feeling of being right in the heart of one of the most amazing cities in the world, and of course the wonderful view of the Pantheon (we paid a little extra for a standard room with a view) plus the people watching in the piazza below. The hotel claims to be the oldest in Rome and does have some character, but is perhaps not as charming as you might expect. Although attractively decorated, there are no obvious signs of historical significance, and our room was fairly typical of many hotel rooms in European cities - small but comfortable. We found the staff generally to be friendly and helpful, but the hotel does have a few niggles. For example, the air con mysteriously didn't operate in our room one night, the toilet flush was a bit unreliable, the jacuzzi function in the bathtub didn't work and they charge extra for WiFi which is only available downstairs.

The location is perfect for a stay in Rome. The beauty of Rome is all of the life in the Piazza's. That is the real heart of Rome ; the Collesuem and the Vatican are must see attractions but they are just that tourist attractions. The central Rome piazzas are where the real action is at and it makes Rome unlike any city I have ever visited. This hotel is right in the heart of the Pantheon piazza and our room overlooked the piazza below as well as the a great view (a little to the left out the window) of the Pantheon front facade. The location is perfect for a stroll to Piazza Navona - great food and very lively huge piazza. This area of central Rome is very safe at night and unlike other areas free from the sometimes overly pushy street vendors at he Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps. We walked all around at midnight or slightly later and never once felt uncomfortable. The best part of this hotel though, is the ability to open the Huge windows and hear the action on the Piazza below ; went to sleep to the sound of wine glasses clinging and restaurants closing down and woke up to the street cleaners and garbage trucks. Loved it felt like part of the city. if you want complete peace and quiet thy have rooms facing the garden backside which are ver silent but we wanted the views and the sites and sounds of the piazza and it was more than we could ask for, The room was very large and had a great bathroom and all of the amenitys we wanted. Breakfast was excellent and in a very pretty room. Despite not being a \"hot\" breakfast I enjoyed breakfast here better than the other 2 hotels we stayed at in Italy and thought there Cappucino was the best of the 3 as well. The hotel had a very boutique feel, I felt the service and staff were very friendly and always available if you needed them. There is no restaurant and this is a small hotel, maybe 20 rooms maybe less, not really certain. The front is very charming and easy to miss. Everything is very classy. Small hotel so don't expect a spa, pool, etc... that 5 star travelers may be accustomed to but for different reasons this is definitely a 5 star hotel. In Italy can't be 5 star without a restaurant so consider this the best possible 4 star option around. Easily walking distance to Trevi Fountain, all of the Piazza's, Spanish Steps not too far nor is the Collesuem. Though we took a taxi to the Vatican. Pantheon is as close as it looks and has free admission. Near to the hotel are some of the most famous places for Gelato, Cappucino and Pizza all within a very short stroll. I am writing this review after a 20 hour trip home and am tired and without a list so names may not be 100% accurate but our close: Gelato: gellateria (only steps a way, the best and also very cheap - all of the locals go here) Cappucino: Sant Euchstachio (only steps away, same thing the best and very cheap, also many locals) Pizza: Pizza Baffetto - 5 or so minute walk, a little past Piazza Navona. Cheap and the best. - also many locals My only small negatives were the wifi (hotel was free internet in the rooms but it is a very slow usable TV computer with wireless keyboard that was more aggreviating than helpful and I couldn't get th hotel wifi to function on my Iphone. There is also a desktop computer in the lobby was I used for a brief time for a very small fee which worked but also was very slow for Internet use. This one negative is definitely not enough for me not to give a 5 star rating considering service, location and view more important than Internet! Overall the hotel cost is higher than I would normaly spend for a room on a nightly basis but location is very important in Rome especially if on a short stay like we were and I believe paying a premium to be right in the heart of Central Rome was well worth it and would highly recommend the Sole Al Pantheon.", "Date": "October 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location near all major attractions\u201d", "Author": "Wasif77", "ReviewID": "UR80665978", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights at this hotel.

The view was AMAZING. I noticed the room was extremely hot. I couldn't get the AC to turn on and one of the units was dripping water onto the floor. The desk clerk came to the room and also could not get the AC to function. He told me that since it was late on Friday night it could not be fixed till the next morning and that I could stay or move my room if I wanted. I moved because there was no way I could sleep in a room that was that hot. They gave me a smaller room (which had a much larger, better bathroom) in the main building overlooking their courtyard. The AC was functioning fine and I got a good night's sleep. I packed all my things in the morning so I could move back to the room with the nice view on Saturday night.

Our room was on the top floor of the annex in which it included a separate living room with sleeper sofa, LCD t.v, cappuccino machine and mini fridge. In that same room we had a balcony that contained a view to die for as we could throw a tennis ball to the steps of the Pantheon. One word, AMAZING. The bedroom was quaint as this is one of the oldest hotels in Rome but really charming and clean still. We had a separate LCD t.v in the bedroom and then a bathroom fit for a king with whirlpool tub. Noise was not an issue as some reviewers had mentioned, but the birds are ridiculous, they sound like a woman screaming. Our room was cleaned and prepped every morning as well as everything restocked. As for the hotel itself, the continental breakfast was just plain Awesome with pastries and breads as well as Prosciutto and mozzarella cheese to name a few. The breakfast truly saved us as Rome is not that cheap and a good FREE meal makes the day even better. The hotel it just picture perfect in every way. The staff are extremely helpful and courteous even with ignorant American travelers as myself. The location honestly is what makes this hotel stand out above the rest. My wife was 26 weeks pregnant and we were able to walk to almost every location because of the central location of the hotel. When places were too far it is nice to have a taxi stand right outside our door.

The manager, Maurizio, is kind and gracious and reccomended some great things to do and eat. He is super at making your vacation special. What a nice man and his staff is terrific. One fabulous place he reccomended was Le Volte, which is a cafe around the corner and had a vaulted ceiling believed to be painted by Michangelo. It is family run and a great find. We kept find ourselves ignoring our travel reecomendations and eating there because it was fun and really good food. The hotel is superbly located---We got in a cab once to go the Vatican and that was only because it was early and the furthest. Everywhere else including all the churches in De Vinci Code book were walkable for my teenage son. We LOVED staying here because when you open up the window you know you are in Rome. Our room overlooked the Pantheon. Everywhere else we have stayed was beautiful but we could have been at a four seasons hotel anywhere in the world. This is Rome, it's flavors, its history, and its amusements. The plaza outside the hotel had street violinists and varous acts to entertain the plazza lined cafes and provided my son the chance to people watch from the room. Food was just out side your room so my son could go grab a pizza. The Hotel food was a nice morning spread to carry thru lunch so you can get to sightseeing and not fuss with breakfast. They had enough of everything to not get tired in our 6 day stay. It was beautifully presented. I will never stay anywhere else. Wake up in Rome! This is the life!

We have been to Rome several times in the past, so we knew the location very well, and that was the reason we selected this hotel. We stayed in the suite in the annex portion of the hotel, room 311. The location is great, right on Piazza Rotunda, you can easily walk to any attraction in the city. From the hotel, it's about 35 minute walk to the Coliseum or Vatican, and 20 minutes to Piazza di Spagna - 3 locations on completely opposite ends of the historical center. All the other attractions are within this triangle - so you are close to everything. The suite is very large - more than adequate for 2 people, would be fine for 3 (daybed in sitting area). Opens directly onto the plaza, with great great view of the Pantheon. The staff was friendly and accommodating (checked us in before 12 while their policy was 2 pm). These are the best qualities of this hotel. It definitely is not what I would expect a suite in a 4 star hotel to be like. The room, though very spacious, lacked any character, was very sparsely decorated, and had a miniature bathroom (turning around in it one had to be careful not to knock off toiletries). The view was great, but we kept our drapes and shutters closed because it was very noisy. The breakfast was adequate, but not extensive or particularly tasty. The location was very convenient, but there are dozens of other hotels in a 3 block radius. We have stayed in many small hotels around Europe and knew what to expect. A 4 star rating is far too generous. Consider it a small, clean, well-run, centrally located 3 star, and compare it against others in the same category. The hotel needs to either drop a star from its rating to reflect the level of accommodations, or do some serious renovations. That being said, I feed I shouldn't be complaining because at the end of the day, I paid 175 euros/night, inc. breakfast, for a huge suite overlooking the Pantheon. Even though the room and the hotel was not what I would expect from a 4 star, neither was the price. The room was noisy, but you can't have both a quiet stay and a view of the prettiest and busiest square in Rome. I am sure other rooms very quieter. So, even though I have serious reservations about staying in this hotel again, I did get great bang for the buck.

It was everything the the del Sole Pantheon was not.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201c2nd time I stayed here\u201d", "Author": "AmFromDC", "ReviewID": "UR6017955", "Content": "This was my 5th trip to Rome and the 2nd time I stayed at the hotel. I returned because primarily because of the location but also because the first stay was very pleasant - - charming room and friendly staff. Relative to other hotels in Rome, the price was not out of line. I find Rome hotels to be among the most expensive in Europe. My experience the second time was similar to the first. This time I stayed in Room 312, a small double, OK because I was by myself. Room overlooked the square and the Pantheon. No trouble with noise because the windows shut very tight. I am a light sleeper and it would have bothered me if I couldn't shut out the noise. Great breakfast. Friendly and helpful staff. Loved the jacuzzi in the bathroom. On the negative side, the room was showing some wear but it was very clean tho small. Relative to the Raphael, this was less expensive, MUCH friendlier, room about the same size, bkfst included.

However, the hotel only has very few rooms which actually look on to the Piazza and, therefore, the Pantheon. On the first night we were put into room 102. The room had no window (except for a very small one in the bathroom), the room was very humid (and smelt that way), the bed had a huge water stain on it and the room had a glass door on to the breakfast terrace (in the morning we could, therefore, hear every word spoken on the breakfast terrace from our bed). After having complained about the first room we received another room on the third floor. Even though this room was a lot better than the first it wasn't worth the rate (EUR 400 per night). The AC hardly worked, small window and quite loud. The other part of our family stayed in a similar room. In the first morning they were woken by water dropping on to them. When they stood up to look what had happened it turned out that water was running down the walls. Although they told the concierge immediately nothing was done to help them and their complaints were ignored.

The problems are that the decor is terribly outdated, the room is not comfortable, and the noise from the piazza is unbearable. I literally woke up 5 to 6 times throughout the night due to people singing, garbage cans being knocked over, and delivery trucks pulling into a nearby alley.

The Sole Al Pantheon is indeed in a fantastic location, but do not be fooled that this is a luxury hotel. We were given a nice room on arrival but there were very little comforts in the room. The mini-bar was not free (as per another reviewer's claims!), and the bathroom was tired to say the least. At night time we were kept awake for the first two nights by the noise from the piazza - both from revellers and the street cleaners who seemed to be up all night banging and crashing around. We then moved rooms and it was quieter, but very hot with not good AC. Some of the staff were lovely, others were aloof and disinterested - you could say rude! There is no room service and breakfast is basic and not necessarily that fresh.

Second, the location!!! You can walk to virtually anywhere- and we did. This is the first time I had been to Rome where I thought it was as easy to navigate as Florence. Thirdly, the food. My husband still talks about the sumptuous breakfast that was included in the price and the proscuitto de parma ham. The free internet is perfect for staying close to the family at home.

Apparently they had to call an engineer to fix the boiler with the result not being satisfactory either. We had a first floor room and until midnight the voices of the staff chatting on the ground floor were so loud that we had to call reception for them to stop.
