The entire ceiling and walls were covered in dark yellow water stains and black mold. My wife also found that under the bath mat that was hanging on the tub, there was a nice home for some sort of bug, as it came running out when she picked it up. She decided that she was going to jump in and rinse off quickly, when she noticed a spider coming down from the crack in the corner of the wall. Needless to say she jumped out as quick as she could.

I went to the office to inform them of the horrible conditions (Mold and bugs) and to request a refund for the next night. I was told by the manager \"you didn't find any bugs\". Oh...nice to be told what I found!! He said \" I want to come see what bugs you found\"..... I told him that he didn't need to come see it, that he just needed to refund my money. He didn't put up much of a fight about that and promptly refunded my 2nd night.

I found the staff to be extremely helpful as they went out of their way to help me with my wireless internet connection in order to complete my homework on time while on vacation. We were there for a concert at the Convention Center and the staff gave us a map of downtown and told us how to ride the trolley to the venue. The decor is mismatched, but the rooms were clean. For the location and price and the especially nice staff, I would defnitely stay here again.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, Ca", "Title": "\u201ckeep looking!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5040479", "Content": "If you are doing case studies on the habits of nocturnal street people, by all means stay here. If you want safety, get far away from this dive. I wished I had read the previous reviews before staying there. Went to San Diego to attend a ballgame at Petco park and all I knew was that this place was within walking distance. When the game let out about 10:30 p.m. (10 innings) we started walking and got lost. I asked a Police officer for directions to the hotel and his response was \"why are you staying there?\" I felt embarrased for not doing the research before booking. In the middle of the night when the blood curdling screams around the corner woke me, I almost got dressed and left. I am a former deputy sheriff and this place scared me. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! KEEP LOOKING!!! A little p.s. the lobby smelled of urine when we walked in. yuk!!!", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Layton UT", "Title": "\u201cFor the love of God...Do not stay here!!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4689988", "Content": "My husband and I received a free trip to San Diego for going to a \"45 minute timeshare pitch\". We declined to pay the $100.00 to upgrade to a better motel because neither of us had ever been to San Diego and didn't plan on spending a lot of time in the room. WHAT A MISTAKE THAT WAS!!! The room itself wasn't bad but the area was terrible. I read the two reviews that were posted previously and thought, \"How bad can it really be?\" It's by far the worst place I've ever stayed at and I've stayed in some real dumps!! Upon arrival, we almost mowed down two people presumably making a drug deal right in the parking lot. They didn't seem to care that we had to wait for them to make the exchange. The dealer even accidently dropped the baggie on the ground, picked it up and finished his business! We went out for the evening and got back to the room quite late. This is when everyone that lives there (pay by the week?) just starts getting active!! And I'm not just talking about the partying back and forth between rooms and on the balcony's. Cars would pull up at all hours, tap on their horn, and then someone would run out to the car and give them \"whatever\" and 20 seconds later they'd drive off. And the hookers!!! You could hear them yelling and the \"clip-clop\" of their high heeled shoes all night. I finally got up and put a towel under the door because it had about a one inch gap underneath and that kept some of the noise out. We laugh about this now....but it made for two really miserable sleepless nights!! Moral of the story....UPGRADE!!!

First they \"lost\" my reservation and it was implied that I may have to pay extra for a room at so short notice. I stood my ground & got my crappy room. I saw cars pulling up outside my room all night, one guy would get out & run up into one of the rooms while his partner waited. He'd get \"something\" & be back out in the car in 2 or 3 minutes & off they'd go. Hooker's patrolling by all night. It's right off the freeway ramp with a chain-link covered walkover that's all graffiti & broken glass. I had to walk 3 blocks to a trolly station & stand amongst the bums to catch a trolly. I preferred to walk, though it took 35 minutes to get to the convention center. I actually passed a bag lady having sex under a blanket with some drunk right by her shopping cart between the curb and a chainlink fence on Industry Blvd. at 7:15am, with cars whizzing by. I have never seen such a epidemic of homeless people like in the San Diego industrial district right next to the bario the hotel's in. I was told that the mild climate draws them from all over. I dreaded returning to the hotel & kept myself locked up in my room till the next morning. DON'T STAY THERE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES - YOU WILL BE MORTIFIED IF YOU DO.
