Everything was clean, the free tea and coffee facilities were good, the breakfast was good, the staff were ok but not great. Overall we enjoyed our stay. However, about a week after returning home I got my bank statement and realised that the hotel had charged me twice for our stay. That's the full hotel bill, plus the card commission fee twice. The second charge had immediately taken me into my overdraft. I was angry and annoyed but thought it was a simple mistake that could be put right. I called the hotel and spoke to a member of staff who then proceeded to tell me that they hadn't charged me twice, they had taken one amount of the money on hold upon check in and although they had released it when I paid at check out, it was then up to my bank to release it back into my account. Obviously this was absolute nonsense, of course it was not up to my bank to put that money back into my account, and they couldn't have had the exact sum of our bill when we checked in as breakfast was not included and we chose day by day whether to have it and add it to the bill or not. I tried to explain that my statement clearly showed that the money had come out of my account and was not \"on hold\" but she was adament so I said I would speak to my bank. They of course said it was a load of rubbish and they had clearly charged me twice and that if they refused to refund me then they would dispute the charge for me. So I called the hotel again, happened to speak to the same member of staff, and when I told her that she was wrong and that they needed to refund me she STILL insisted that the money was on hold and it could take up to a week for my BANK to release it - despite the fact that it had now been two weeks since the charge took place!! Then she got very moody and rude and said that there was no manager for me to speak to and there wouldn't be a manager at the hotel for another 2 days so nothing could be done at the moment. I asked her to leave an urgent message for the manager to contact me as soon as possible. They never did. I decided not to waste any more money making calls to Amsterdam and speaking to idiotic members of staff so I had to dispute it through my bank. And luckily, after about a month, I got the money back. It wouldn't have been so bad if the staff had been apologetic and sympathetic and dealt with their obvious mistake quickly instead of making rubbish excuses like I was stupid enough to believe them and trying to con me out of my money.

A lot of people complain about the smallness of Amsterdam hotels but you have to remember that the architecture of the city is like that, people live in small, narrow apartments. Also, there are so many things to do in Amsterdam, why would you want to stay in the room so it doesn't matter if it's small. The basic thing in a city hotel is cleanliness, convenience, location, good service, good small eats like breakfast, good housekeeping, good beds and free coffee/tea which this hotel has provided for us.

When we arrived at the hotel last on Friday afternoon, I asked the extremely helpful Reception staff if it was possible to have a room at the back of the hotel, as I heard that it was quieter at the back. She said no problem and placed myself and my wife on the 3rd floor at the side. The room was fine, the beds were very soft and comfortable and you had all the facilities you could want, including cable TV, hairdryer, and a shower bathroom (no room for a bath really) same in most Amsterdam hotels. The location was perfect, just a 10 minute tram ride from Central Station, on the Number 1 Tram at a cost of 2.60 Euros, and 15 minutes from the Airport, which is directly connected at a cost of 7.60 Euros. So you are there in no time. It is also close to a busy square, (Luijkenstraat) where you get lots of cafes and bars, as well as street jugglers and raps artists as well as really close to the RijksMuseum which is well worth the visit, even just for Rembrandts Night Watch. 12.50 Euros each. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the breakfast, or anything to eat there, but they have Free Internet and Tea and Coffee near Reception. The rooms are small, but it is ok at night. We stayed in on the Saturday Night, as the weather was terrible outside. We also travelled to Edam and the Windmills on the Sunday, on a trip, which was about a block away. To sum up, the Eden Theatre District Hotel is perfectly adequate, they do take 50 Euros off you when you arrive, but give it back (minus the taxes) when you leave, so all in all a pleasant stay all down, and Amsterdam is great, this is my third visit.

We then went to our room which was a small double with a canal view on the 2nd floor. We had read reviews before we went and were fully aware that the rooms could be small, and ours certainly was, but was more than adequate with a double bed, desk, small wardrobe, excellent safe facility, and lovely clean bathroom with a great power shower. There isn't much room in the wardrobe to hang your clothes, only 5 or 6 hangers available but if you're happy to live out of your suitcase for your stay like we were, then you will be fine. There was a great flat screen tv which has british channels BBC World and also BBC1 and BBC2! It also had Discovery and a few other satellite channels. You could also pay for movies, which varied from Adult, to recent Blockbusters and Kids. It also had a Wake up call facility, and you could also check your bill on screen. The room also has free internet access if you decide to bring your laptop, although the hotel does have 2 free internet access PC's in the bar. The bar is small but nice, prices are not too bad for Amsterdam. There is also a vending machine (a bit dearer) which sells juice, coke, heineiken and sweets/pringles, you can use this all through the nite if you wish as the bar closes at 1am. Breakfast is optional at 15 euros which we thought was on the pricey side, so we didn't use it. There is an Irish pub just beside the Holland Casino about 300m away which does a very hearty full Irish brekkie for 10 euros! There are also plenty of eateries in the Leidse square just a minutes walk away. Leidse square and the Leidesplein itself is your nearest place for restaurants, snacks and loads of shops, and coffeeshops! Italian, Pizzerias, Chinese, Indian, McDonalds, Pancakes, Patisseries, fast food places, the choice is immense! We went to Saturnino's Italian which was lovely, cosy but a bit noisy, but worth it for the lovely carbonara and the Panna Cotta desert! We ate out every nite in different restaurants and roughly you will pay around 20 euros each for a decent 2 course with wine. The hotel is in a great location, in a really nice area. A 5 min walk to the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh. The vondel park is the same. You can walk to the Dam Square/Central Station area in about 30 mins. We didn't need to take the tram or bus because everywhere you would want to go is walkable. I would definately stay in this hotel again for the location. The rooms were small but more than adequate, the hotel services are fine and for the price (115 euros a night) I think it's very reasonable as some Amsterdam hotels can be very pricey in this area. We had great service, the room was cleaned daily and towels replaced daily. The reception were happy to call us a taxi for our journey home too.
