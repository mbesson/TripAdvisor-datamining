The condos are, without a doubt, far superior to many other condos on Maui, but there are issues. Over the years there are more and more families with lots of kids. The pools are packed with screaming kids and parents that let the kids continue to scream. Honua Kai needs to designate one pool for adults, just like many other hotels in Hawaii have done. The hotel is loosing people that are truly looking for a vacation without kids. Why do you have to take your kids with you everywhere? When paying high nightly rates I don't want kids screaming at every pool. The unit I had was not cleaned properly. Beer bottles and cigarettes on the lanai, dirty tub, shower, and sinks, grease on the kitchen cabinets, razor container in the shower, dirty utensils and plates, the dishwasher had a very smell and never clearn dishes properly, and still there was more. The hotel did correct the problem to my satisfaction, but the issue should never had been there upon checkin. Don't know if the hotel is under new management but conditions have continued to declined. The kid issue needs to be resolved. Aslo, the hotel has not finished the spa and there are two ugly digs which many units view. This has been this way for five years.

I'd recommend buying booze and juice from costco and making your own cocktails. I had read other reviews mentioning a smell from the water treatment plant. While we could definitely smell it from the road, we never smelled it in our unit or on the lanai. The market, while pricey, had many specialty items to choose from. One of our group has Celiac Disease and this market offered her many gluten-free options. Definitely try the gelato. It was one of the highlights of our trip!! My only complaint about the whole trip was the weather. It rained and was extremely windy almost all of the 7 days we were there.

The resort itself is beautiful. It is located right on the beach, but has enough pools to entertain you for weeks! Duke's (the restaurant on the resort) is great for drinks, but wouldn't recommend it for food unless you're willing to spend a lot. We found that one of our favorite restaurants was the Aloha Mixed Plate, (down the road on Front St.) which despite its appearance from the front, has a beautiful view and great food! This resort is well worth the money. The staff is kind, helpful and incredibly accommodating. The market inside the resort is great, but definitely pricey! The only issue we had with the resort was that there was A LOT of little kids. It's a great place for family, but if you're looking for quaint adult pools with no kids, I wouldn't recommend this.

We rented a one bedroom condo and I have to say it is beautiful! Very happy with our condo. I read some reviews by others about the lack of cleaning service, but we have not had that experience during our stay here. The sheets on our bed were even changed twice the first week and we always have enough supplies (laundry soap, dishwasher soapy, etc). We are at the beginning of our second week here. The kitchen is very well stocked and the condo is very spacious. If you have small kids this is a great place for families. My son is 13.5 and there were very few kids his age, which was too bad. I wish I had taken him here when he was younger. It's a fantastic place for little kids with the waterfall pool and water slide. The only complaint we have is not related to the resort at all - the wind. It is very windy on this side of Maui as others have mentioned in previous reviews. We were told that this is normal for this area. For that reason I wouldn't come back to this part of Maui. It is simply too windy - you feel like you are going to literally blow away at times. It's ridiculously windy and you couldn't enjoy the pool or beach area nearly as much because of it. If it weren't for the wind we would definitely come back here though. Thankfully we could use our lanai quite a bit since we were sheltered by cement walls on our lanai - ours was more towards the building while the ones beside us on the right stuck out more and had no cement walls on either side of the ends of the lanai.

There were seven of us in our group and the accommodations worked perfectly. There are three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a wonderful queen sleeper. Two of the rooms are en suite. There is plenty of closet space. Our vacationer who slept on the queen sleeper used one of the master bedroom closets, conveniently located right inside that suite. Evelyn and Anthony have filled this condo with so much care that you feel it. The kitchen had everything we required, there is a lovely theatre couch that we fought over and plenty of space for seven happy campers to make themselves comfortable. The lanai was a favorite spot. We found ourselves congregating there every morning and evening to watch the whales and to discuss our day. Dukes is located right at the Honua Kai and made it convenient for eating. They also serve meals around the pool and we took advantage of that as well. Hula Pie - enough said. For our merry group it was great convenience to go up to the condo and fix drinks and take them back out to the pool, so we were very appreciative of the blender. During our planning stage, Evelyn and Anthony were very receptive to any inquiries we had about the condo, parking, arrangements for activities or any questions we came up with. They were wonderfully helpful. A couple of our favorites: the master bathroom\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. it is so soothing, the splendid art work throughout the condo, the wonderful big kitchen and that huge lanai where we practically lived and the number code entry that made it great for our big group to come in and out easily. Evelyn and Anthony also provided mid-week towel replacement and a general clean up of the condo\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.. nice! We know that when we return to Hawaii, and our group is ready now, lol, that we will be in touch with Evelyn and Anthony to share their piece of Paradise in Paradise. Thank you! The above would be our review to vrbo - we have nothing but good to say about our accomodations and this resort - it was simply lovely. While in Maui we also took a whale watching tour with Safari, highly recommend them - it was everything our last whale watching trip wasn't - meaning we saw a pod of whales and got some lovely pictures. We also went to the Old Lahaini Luai, sitting in the chairs not the ground area, and found that to be fantastic - we highly recommend it. We stood in line and ate at the Gazebo, a great experience, the pancakes are fantastic and they even provided a rainbow!

We found this property to be very spacious, and less crowded than the hotels along Kaanapali Beach. The staff was more than friendly. Everyone goes out of their way to say hi, and offer a hand when needed. The rooms are immaculate, and the maid service is prompt. We got a one bedroom ocean view room and I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the view. The view of the ocean was very partial to say the least. You have to stand on one side of the lanai to see any bit of water. Building could have been constructed a little better to offer more of a view than the adjacent building. Aina market in the hotel is a great ammenity as is the fact that the Times Market is directly across the street if you are in need of groceries. Dukes Restaurant on location has great food and the bartenders are super. The only drawbacks are the fact the if you are looking for a honeymoon type of resort, this is not it. Kids are everywhere. It is more of a family style condo than a romantic retreat. Remember this also. This is a very windy property. I had a lounge chair blow across the lawn and hit me. It is usually always raining in the West Maui Mountains and the rain very often blows across the property. This does not happen in the hotels at Kaanapali as much as it does in Honokowai.

We did stay through a private owner, so we were not charged resort fees and did not have maid service. The place is very nice. The rooms were very large and comfortable. The veiws are breathtaking! We watched whales everyday from our balcony! We were on the 8th floor and found it to be very quiet. We didn't notice any bad smell while we were there. The tradewinds, in the afternoon, made it so that we had to shut the glass doors for an hour or so. There were enough pools so that we did not feel crowded. We traveled with Grandparents and two teens, so we found that there was something for every age group. FYI...the place is not an adult only style place. If you are looking for no kids around....then you will not like Honua Kai. The beach was lovely! Yes, there is a reef right off the beach. For our family, that was wonderful!!! We found sandy spots and went in and snorkeled 25-50 feet off the beach many times. We saw lots of fish, eels and turtles in the water. We could also hear the whales while under the water. The reef was SO convenient...no driving...no boats...no fees....just get in and swim!!! If you are looking to swim only, then walk down the beach and jump in. Just south of the hotel the area gets more sandy. The only problem we had was that the air condition went out for 3 of the 10 nights. That made sleeping difficult. We were encouraged not to use the screens when it was windy, instead just leave the glass doors open. We were told that bugs would not be a problem. We did this and woke up with bugs bits.

The gym in the complex is also very new with a great selection of cardio equipment. The weights section is a little on the low end with 50 pounds being the largest dumbbell and only 1 bench. Mornings were busy but not over crowded. The beach off the resort is nice however nothing amazing. The resort pools and area's are a really great design. They offer a good blend of open area's and more private area's. I think anyone could find a spot they are happy with around the pool. Only downfall is that there is not a swim up bar. They general rule is the drinks should be bought from dukes bar if you are swimming around the pool. Exception is the BBQ area's. However after buying 1 round of drinks (which is kind of annoying as you have to get out of the water and go to the bar area), we filled up plastic water bottles with drinks and ice.

The service is great and the staff is genuinely nice. I've been working in the travel industry for over 10 years and you become a bit jaded when you travel allot, both for business and pleasure. But this resort impressed me and I will definitely recommend it both professionally and privately. I only have one thing to complain about and that is the $25 a day resort fee that they charge. I have no problem with a resort fee but it's a bit rich when you on top of the $25 a day have to pay for beach chairs and umbrellas if you want them on the beach.

We were in room 818 in the Konea Tower. The room was very nice. Modern, clean and spacious with two bathrooms, a full kitchen and washing machine and dryer. The large lanai was particularly nice. Although it was too hot in the mornings it was extremely pleasant in the afternoons and early evenings. We ate dinner on the balcony most nights. Whales: 818 has partial ocean views but the sea is too far away for whale watching even with binoculars. We were there in peak whale season and saw lots of whales, in the distance, when we were down at the beach. We also did a whale watching tour which was just fantastic. The person at the tour desk recommended that we go on a smaller boat rather than with one of the larger operators which turned out to be extremely good advice. When whales approached the boat everyone (there were six people on the tour altogether) was able to get a great view rather than just those people who were lucky enough to be seated on the side the whales came up to. The name of the company we went with was UFO Parasailing and I would highly recommend them. Car and parking: It is definitely worth having a car if you are at Honua Kai. There is an excellent supermarket across from the resort and the on-sight restaurant Duke's is very good but it is a bit of a distance to pretty much anything else. There is a free shuttle that takes you to Whaler's Village where there are shops and restaurants and several other resorts in the area. We booked through Kaanapali Beach Properties and they made a big thing of the fact that we had to pay separately for parking - $10 a day. Their e-mail instructions were very clear that when we arrived the first thing we had to do on arrival was arrange resort parking for the full lenght of our stay at the front desk. Because we arrived very late at night we followed these instructions without being able to assess the parking situation for ourselves but the next morning it was pretty clear that what we had paid for was underground parking and we could have parked the whole time for free in the open air car parks. Snorkelling: The beach immediately in front of the resort was okay for seeing fish but there is very little live coral. However about 5 minutes walk or swim away the beach in front the next resort down going in the direction of Whalers' Village is much more interesting and further along still, at Black Rock the snorkelling is just great, although it did get quite crowded. My son and I snorkelled right around the point and saw loads of fish, several turtles and a white tipped reef shark. You need to be a confident swimmer to go around the point but with fins on the current wasn't really an issue. Black Rock is probably about half an hour's stroll from Honua Kai but I'm reasonably sure the free shuttle bus goes there. There is limited beach parking at the Sheraton, about six places, so if you arrive very early you might get lucky and be able to park.

The lanai's are wonderful to wake up and have coffee outside. Beach is beautiful. (coral right on shore really does cut up feet...beware!) And now the cons: 1. $25 resort fee daily. For what? We self-parked, used the internet a little, and why would you go to the fitness center when you have a beautiful beach and boardwalk to exercise on? Usually you get a newspaper too included in this fee (in other resorts) but not here. In fact, in the store, the New York Times and Wall Street had extra fees and were a day behind because of the cost to ship them. 2. Speaking of fitness centers, I was kind of excited to attend a fun class on the beach or something, but I did not see anything organized. Not really any other events either. 3. I thought the front desk staff was not kind or accomodating at all. I spoke with three different people for several things and they were just \"meh.\" I also did not get anything I asked for. 4. Market was expensive, but nice to have for coffee and snacks. $7 for salsa? Whoa. I guess it's expected. 5. KIDS. I love kids, but there were a ton of them. Of course, I understand why parents would bring kids here. There is a full kitchen in each room and space to breathe. However, they were everywhere, making lots of noise. There should be an adults only pool or space. I didn't want to get in pool because they were everywhere. We were on our honeymoon and we felt really out of place because there were so many families and older couples. (grandparents) 6. They only change bedsheets every three days. I completely agree with being eco-friendly, but I think we should get the option and can designate if we want fresh sheets or not. We came back pretty dirty some days and I am the kind of person who sleeps better being clean. 7. Big resorts means lots of walking to get to pool or beach. 8. In terms of location, Lahaina is far from the Road to Hana and Haleakala, so make sure you're aware of that. Try Wailea if location is a factor. 9. Duke's was good! Happy Hour was fun. 10. We had a partial ocean view studio on floor 2. We shared a big balcony with the rest of the second floor and at first, I did not like this. We had to walk out on the shared space to see the ocean and other people were around. I would have liked to be secluded on our own balcony. I asked to switch and the desk said they were not accomodating switches at this time. Kind of a bummer but better than facing the mountains for sure.

It's amazing that they charge a $25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex. I've read the numerous other reviews on this place, and most of them are spot on. The rooms are nice, because they are new, but everything else goes downhill. Here's my list of complaints: 1. Horrible Raw Sewage smell 2. Cockroaches 3. Too many small children that intrude on everyone else's enjoyment 4. Balcony Chairs make horrible noises to units beneath - it could wake the dead!!! 5. Uncomfortable pool chairs that feel like you are lying on cement & not enough chairs to accomodate the amount of rooms at the place. This place is a condominium complex, so trying to get \"Quality Service\" is not going to happen. Most of the units have been sold to private owners who rent the units out either through Honua Kai or other rental companies. The place itself held on to a handful of units so they could make some extra money, but in in the end, this place is NOT A HOTEL or RESORT, it is individually owned condominiums. So don't expect to get good Service or Amenities, because it just isn't going to happen. They shouldn't be advertising it as a Luxury Resort, because it is just plain false advertising. In the end, if you have numerous small children under the age of 6, don't mind the wonderful stench of raw sewage, and can view cockroaches as a tropical enjoyment, this is your place.

The unit was a corner unit with a huge lanai with a partial ocean-view and also a view of the mountains. The landscaping around the property was nice, with streams and rocks. The unit was nicely decorated with nice furniture, linens and mattresses. The pull-out couch actually had a comfortable mattress. The kitchen is beautiful, but small with not a lot of storage or cooking counter space so if you were here for a long stay and you wanted to cook I could see this being a problem. Our kids (11, 12, 14) really loved the pools. They aren't disney-type pools with lots of slides but there is a lazy-type river and lots of spots to find a chair and privacy. We loved Dukes restaurant on site and had eaten at the one in Honolulu. The bartenders were very friendly and it was nice to be able to grab a drink at the pool and also ocean-front. It was extremely windy during our time there -- so much so that our kids really didn't like going to the beach. Once you got into the ocean it was ok, but sitting on the beach was not an option because the sand literally whipped your face. I'm sure it's not like this all the time, but we were disappointed because one of the reasons we chose this resort was for the beach. The service was ok inside the resort. No one went out of their way to check on us or be super-friendly but they weren't rude either. The gormet shop was a good place to pick up lunch or snacks for the room but there is also a grocery store across the street.

Our experience with them was 5 stars and my review reflects only that, not necessarily the entire resort. We do find Honua Kai to be a nice mix of beautiful condo space with resort amenities. Our interior and lanai were lovely as are all of the units. The view from our angled interior courtyard room was very good. We had everything we needed or wanted. We enjoyed snorkeling, sunsets on the beach, Dukes for pool service, happy hours and dinners, the pools and hot tubs, Aina Market and even the convenient parking. We did find that the outdoor furniture at the pool and on the lanai was not especially comfortable. Being a condo resort, we could order drinks or snacks at the pool or make our own and bring them down. We enjoyed both. Joe and Rhonda provided beach chairs, towels and boogie boards, and also a nice welcome package of Champaign, Hawiian coffee and chocolates. We really appreciated the late check out on our last day. We will definitely return. Do not hesitate to rent this studio from vrbo.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "malaysia", "Title": "\u201cVery nice!\u201d", "Author": "km35", "ReviewID": "UR124177496", "Content": "Visited in July 2011 after a 4 day stay in Oahu. The Hawaiian islands are absolutely fantastic and Maui in particular was a blast. The Honua Kai was a lovely hotel/apartment with lovely pools, excellent service and a handy albeit expensive grocery store downstairs. The guest BBQ area was a nice touch but often crowded. The hotel is somewhat out the way meaning a car is essential if you wish to go to lanai or whalers village. The sewage smell complaints are perhaps valid but more if you are in the whalers village area and to be honest only if you are driving past on the main road.

It is very tough leaving...... The common themes of the many other reviews are true. Beautiful and new complex, great appliances and top notch furnishings. I will point out some things that were a bit ambiguous before our visit. 1. There were some reviewers that thought the beach was poor. I disagree. If you walk 100-200ft to the left (towards the westin) their is great sandy entry. Saw many families enjoying the water. You don't need water shoes in my opinion. The off shore snorkeling was incredible. 2. The wind issue.....was a no issue for us. Usually very calm until around noon, then the wind picks up. I would say without the wind it would be uncomfortably hot. Spent many evenings out on the lanai without issue. 3. The amount of children. Was a bit concerned with this as we were traveling as a couple. I think most condo like complexes attract families because of convenience. So there are many young families, but I did not find this to hamper my enjoyment. 4. The \"sewer smell\". Never happened to us. Overall, fantastic vacation. We will definitely return to the Honua Kai and Maui. Best side trip was sunrise at Haleakala and the sliding sands hike (unreal!). A must do, even with the early wake up. Try to get an ocean view on a higher floor (5 and up). Its really nice to enjoy the site and sound of the ocean as you are starting or finishing your day.

Start with the CONS: -Weird smells. On our first evening in Maui, there was a really nasty smell just as we drove into the Kaanapali region. Very sulphur-y, sewery. After talking to other travelers, there is apparently a smell in Maui, Kannapali area called the VOG..seriously, that's what it's called- or they were pulling our leg. It's basically volcano gas. This could have been the cause of some of the smell. However, there was an occasional, recurring sewer smell in the area and the hotel region, maybe also due to the nearby water treatment plant. If you don't like gross, vomit-y smells, you may want to do some research before booking this place. -South part of hotel is next to an unattractive, weedy, seemingly deserted construction lot. There are a few pieces of large construction equipment parked on the lot but there was no construction activity during our stay. Really shabby view on that part of the building. Avoid being located there or negotiate a very low rate. -Location is far from the main and more attractive activity areas. We ended up driving to Whalers village every second night to walk on the very attractive boardwalk and visit the shops. We paid the parking fees at Whalers Village if we didn't make enough purchases to have validated parking. -Air conditioning inconsistent from room to room. There is one control. The bedroom was freezing cold and the living room was still too warm. The unit had two excellent ceiling fans and we kept them on all the time and used the air conditioning sparingly. However, if you like the air cond on all the time, make sure your room has properly working equipment. -Outrageous fee to park in the Honua Kai Parkade. Ten bucks per day. Here are the PROS: -Well equipped kitchen. Terrific appliances. Had every utensil we needed and we cooked a lot due to having small children with us. -Washer and dryer in unit was super convenient. These appliances are the vent-less variety so the dryer takes a long time to dry a load. We ran the laundry at night. You would be annoyed if you wanted to do a quick load in the morning. Having our own washer and dryer was key for us and our young family. -Suite was modern and nicely decorated. The majority of accommodation in Maui is very dated. If you like new, book a new place like this one or a freshly renovated condo. -Staff was pleasant. We booked our unit through the condo rentals at KaanapaliBeachRentals.com so we were technically not hotel guests and did not have maid service. However, when we met any staff in the hotel, we were always greeted pleasantly. Overall, we will probably visit Maui sometime in the future- or try another island; depending on flights available from our town. If in Maui, we would stay at a different place. Either directly located in the Whalers Village boardwalk or perhaps try the Kihei area which is located closer to the airport and the major large stores like Costco, Walmart and so forth.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "germantown, tn", "Title": "\u201cSimply the Best\u201d", "Author": "Loves2Travel222", "ReviewID": "UR124032110", "Content": "As a veteran of 31 vacations in Hawaii I have a pretty good base for comparison. The Honua Kai is my all time favorite. It is nice and it is new (the first is a must and the second is a preference for me.) Even the smallest room on the property has a lovely bedroom, large living room / dining room / kitchen combo, and large bathroom. There is also a washer / dryer in each room. Of special note is the quality of the building materials. From the interior doors to the back splash tile in the kitchen to the top end appliances, all appear to have been selected with quality as the first objective - often a rarity in hotel construction. The grounds of the hotel are lovely. Its beach is near perfect. The location is excellent. Honua Kai is on the extreme north end of Kaanapali Beach. It is away from the crowds that often pack into the Hyatt to Sheraton stretch of Kaanapali. But the shops and restaurants of the Whalers Village are just a very short drive or long walk away. A highlight of Honua Kai's location is the stretch of beach front trees just south of the hotel. They are spaced in such a way that they form little semi private \"rooms.\" My husband and I bought two beach chairs, some bottles of wine, and picnic supplies at Walmart. Almost every day of our vacation we \"camped\" out in the shade of these trees and watched the waves and the whales.....beach vacations don't get any better than that. My only recommendation if choosing to stay at the Honua Kai is that you book a room with the garden, mountain, or ocean views. The resort view rooms actually overlook the parking lot and a field (these rooms need to be renamed asap.) One more tip for a great stay at Honua Kai....thanks to the excellent kitchen facility in each room, be sure to have a few meals on your balcony. The Honua Kai balconies are surprisingly large and well furnished.

The pool chairs around the pools do fill up quickly in the monring but we learned to go down early and set out towels to hold our seats.

We used two towels to make ourselves more comfortable on the lounges. We did not lie on the beach as there is no shade provided......no umbrellas or anything.

There is a large grocery store across the road from the resort which supplies everything. We did stop at Costco on the way to stock up.

We booked directly with the property and this review will address amenities for that type of reservation. I am not sure what is included if you book with an ower. We were fortunate to have a week of great weather so the wind that other posters have mentioned wasn't a problem for us. It was quite windy the last day but it was nice to have the cooling breeze on the balcony and didn't bother us at all. We had an ocean view studio on the 8th floor of the Konea tower (821) and had a great view. The little time we spent in the room we were whale watching from the lanai. I would like to mention to the ladies that the bath products were all Aveda and replenished often (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand soap and lotion). Also, we were given a starter kit with dishwasher detergent, washing power, bounce and hand towels. Coffee is also provided. There is a hair dryer in the room that works great (better than mine at home!) There is an iron and full size ironing board. Just beware if you plan to wash clothes it takes a very long time for them to dry. The view from room 821 was great. I walked around the resort and found that I preferred the pool area in the Konea tower, but you are free to use either one. Duke's and Anini on site were great and Anini had some really neat local gourmet food and salts and such. We got everything we needed for the \"Road to Hana\" day there including a soft side cooler (about $10 but reusable and worth the price). The pools are very nice and we could always find a spot off by ourselves. The beach directly in front was nice. We didn't go in the water but it was more suited for snorkeling and diving than swimming. Also, for the divers they offer a guided shore dive daily (for extra cost). Just a note about the smell of the sewage plant nearby, we smelled it coming to and leaving the resort but never inside. We were facing the ocean and I would think that the rooms facing the mountains might get a whiff of it. I would try for an inside facing condo. We had maid service daily that removed trash, washed dishes, made bed and replenished bath towels and supplies. After a few days the linens were changed also. There is covered parking underground and above ground parking. Valet is also available and is included in the $25 resort fee. If you plan to head out for excursions before 6:00 am you should park your own car because valet is not available until then. Also, do not plan on getting a late check out. Most hotels I have stayed in allowed this but we were told no and other people I overheard enquiring at the front desk were also told no.

There were actually 6 of us (3 couples) sharing a 2 bedroom unit. Honua Kai was highly recommended to us and we were told that a 2 bedroom with the pull out couch would be more than enough room... and it was. The rooms are absolutely enormous and our view was spectacular. The resort is brand new so everything is first class. The pool... or pools as I should say were great and having Dukes right on site was a nice luxury to have. They also have a whole bank of BBQs which makes cooking up your own meals fun and social. I really don't have anything bad to say about this resort but there were 2 things that you should know before you are going... 1. This is not a resort for young people travelling with friends looking to party, we are not partiers by any means but we were given 2 noise warnings... once at exactly 10:01pm (quiet time is 10pm) and once, believe it or not, at 10:30am while we were having breakfast on our deck! The staff were very polite about it and maybe the people we had living underneath our unit were just really picky but it was a bit extreme. If you are planning on being in your room, doors shut by 10 then this is a great place for you. But if you have really young children who can be a bit loud in the morning or if you want to play cards on your deck and enjoy the ocean air after 10pm I would recommend another place. Also it should be noted that Dukes closes early in the evening too so if you want to go for a drink at 9 or 10 you can't go there. 2. The other issue I had is the pull out couch is unbelievably uncomfortable... I'd actually go as far to say the floor is better. So if you are travelling with kids, or trying to do it on the cheap, don't be the person that gets stuck on the pull-out. The other thing I will say is spend the money on a unit with an ocean view... the back units look out onto the street, which isn't pretty at all, and we were really glad we spent the extra cash as the sunsets every night on the deck was totally worth it. I'd definitely recommend this place to couples, seniors, or people looking for a quiet and deluxe vacation.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Family Trip ~ lovely resort\u201d", "Author": "SBSuz", "ReviewID": "UR123237577", "Content": "The true test of a good resort if how they handle things when there is a problem. We arrived to a big problem - the owner of the condo we were booked into was still there and not planning to leave. Needless to say, I wasn't a happy with my 2 small children in tow and exhausted from a long plane ride - with no room at 5pm. The manager was very professional and came to talk to me about the situation. We went out to the pool while they worked on a solution and within an hour I received a call on my celphone and a wonderful room. Once we were moved in, the manager called to make sure everything was satisfactory and offered a hotel credit which we used to at Duke's for dinner. I appreciated the call and personal attention. The resort is beautiful. The grounds are well maintained, the units are like new and the staff is very friendly. My kids loved all the pools. There are plenty of great spots for young children to play - always a concern with a toddler. The wading pools were perfect and well planned with private spaces and many little lagoon areas. My older son loved the water slide. I am sure he went down it at least 50 times. I was a little concerned about the wind after reading a few reviews, but we didn't have that experience. The beach in front of the resort is nice for kids and sunset walks. Be careful if you walk out past a few steps though, there is a lot of coral. My brother-in-law stepped out a little too far and did injure his foot. All in all, everyone in our group of 19 had a great week at the Honua Kai. We have stayed at a few places on the islands over the years and this was our most successful trip. We hope to return for another stay soon. ..One last thing, the beds are very comfortable.

We were in the 2nd tower next to the vacant lot which will become the 3rd. We had an interior view, north facing on the 7th floor - top of our part of the tower, but parts of the building are taller. If we returned, would go to the south facing side of the tower to get the sunset. Each tower is laid out in a straight \"u\", not graduating. This means that one side stares directly into the opposite side, so privacy is not a feature. Fine for vacation, but would get old if we owned. We were happy to get this unit ( from VRBO, managed by Harris Property, not Honua Kai), but it was a little tight with 2 boys on the pullout sofa in the living room. The lanai was large and with the folding window doors adding tremendously to our living space. The trade winds are not a joke, however, and some days, would blow so hard that you had to keep the picture window/doors closed to keep your belongings. Many times we grilled on the lawn, at the property's built-in gas grills and found this fun and communal, meeting many families from Chicago and Canada, this trip. Lovely property. Only downside was the surf. This side of Black Rock has shallow coral, so kids NEED to WEAR water socks to prevent cutting up their feet. Snorkeling was good, but better a little south in front of Westin - our gal at the surf shop sent us there, and it is a quick walk. Boogie Boarding waves were fun. The Ka'anapali beach walk was great for running and connecting to Ka'anapali south of Black Rock. They call the area north of Black Rock at teh Sheraton Upper Ka'anapali, and the area south of Black Rock, Lower Ka'anapali. It was fairly wet during Xmas week, when we were there, so we would get in the car to find sunshine - go SOUTH! We were in Wailea and it was sunny and great! You can usually get parking at the beach access lots, marked with blue road signs. One day, Lower Ka'anapali's beach parking was all taken by 10:00 - bummer! It was whale watching season and we could see blow spouts of water off in the distance but would have needed a whale watching tour to see them up close.

We stayed in #413, a 2 BR oceanview unit with huge wrap-around lanai. The condo was quite lovely and accommodated my family of five nicely. Kaanapali Beach Rentals were great to work with, and I appreciated being able to choose a particular unit ahead of time so I knew exactly what we were getting. The whole complex was beautiful, with gorgeous landscape, fabulous pools and a great beach for swimming, snorkelling or walking. The beds were comfortable (with the exception of the sofa bed....however we found a foam mattress in one of the bedroom closets and put this on top of the sofabed mattress for extra cushioning and this seemed to solve the problem). We ate a couple of times at Dukes restaurant on site, with great options for both adults and kids. Do yourself a favour and do NOT MISS the Hula Pie (one piece was often large enough for the whole family to share). Of our accommodations on the three different Hawaiian islands, this stay at Honua Kai felt the most like a hotel, due to the onsite restaurant and the hotel-style pools. My youngest kids enjoyed the water slide and waterfalls in the largest pool. There is a gourmet market onsite with take-out options, alcohol and some basic groceries. Across the street is a full grocery store. We had an underground parking spot... very handy. One of the fantastic features of this condo was the foldable glass walls in the living room that you open and fold (like an accordion) then you can pull screens across so you have a completely open feel to the room and take advantage of the ocean breezes. The one thing to mention, however, is that with curtains open, and lights on at night, you can see directly into the condo units across from you (as they can see into your condo) as all the buildings are in a \"C\" formation. If you want privacy, the curtains can be pulled shut, of course. During our stay we drove the Road to Hana in our rental minivan. Be sure to check out the Garden of Eden Aboretum & Botanical Garden along the way. There is a $15 admission charge but it is well worth it. There are numerous interesting plants/flowers to see (all labelled with descriptions), and some unbeatable views out to the ocean and of waterfalls within this nature reserve. You may recognize Keopuka Rock from the opening scene of Jurassic Park . Also, it is a nice rest from all the driving along the windy road (especially if any of your group are prone to car-sickness!!). The following day we took surfing lessons from Maui Wave Riders -- a definite highlight of our two week trip for everyone in the family. That evening we attended the Drums of the Pacific Luau at the Hyatt. Food was good, & the show was fantastic. My kids especially enjoyed the fire-knife-dancer. We spent some time shopping at Whaler's Village, ate at the Hula Grill and spent time snorkelling at the beach and playing in the pools on our two remaining days.

I too much like everyone else did my research and then some. We decided to book via a management company rather than the hotel. This saved us $250 per night for our 10 night and we were guaranteed an exact room number. We had the opportunity to look at pictures of the room and knew exactly what we were getting. The resort is great. Brand new, across the street (walking distance ) from Times Market (you DO NOT need to stop at costco). Love Aina Market on the premises. Great for your morning coffee, mid day snacks or a quick lunch (panini, wraps & sandwiches). Duke's is great too. But much like a few other reviewers, I found some of the servers to be very rude. And during busy times, the servers were disorganized. The pools are great. My 3yr old had a blast as did my 10 month old. The Lazy River pool is really good for babies. The water is warmer & the poor is generally less crowded. The grounds are beautiful. The beach is nice but not as nice as the beach at Sheraton down the road. There is coral so watch out when walking into the ocean. There is a beach walk that takes you all the way to Whaler's Village. Its a great walk day/evening/night (a little dark when the sun goes down). Its a nice path and I enjoyed walking to & from the Village. Our room was AMAZING. Room 209 in Hokulani Tower is one of the best in its category at the resort. Close to the elevator (yes 2nd floor but we had strollers & the stairs were hard to find and very unclean when I did locate them). The view was wonderful. Room is fully stocked. If you plan on doing lots of laundry like me with 2 boys, buy your own detergent. The detergent in the room is so so. The showers are great, seriously, its like a mini spa break. Be aware that the garbage shoot is located on the 2nd & 10th floor ONLY. We didn't know that & lucked out to be on the 2nd floor. I think this was an important thing for me. I really cant imagine having to drag my garbage on an elevator. I think the one surprising thing for me was that none of the entrance doors to the buildings were automatic or have the option of being automatic. This was a bit of a challenge with a full hand or strollers. The wind: well yes, it was windy even on hot sunny days. To the point that when my son came out of the water he was shivering. Is that reason enough not to go back to Honua kai? Well for us no. But it is winddddyyyy. Wailea is sunny and less windy, but honestly at this point of our lives, with 2 young kids, we need an apartment type of hotel. I like newer buildings & appliances. I looked at a couple of hotel apartments in Wailea or Kihei, but either they were not on the beach or just too old & awful or adult oriented or had very small pools or were just too expensive during the holidays ($1700/nite for a 2br). SO, am I compromising by choosing to return to Honua Kai? No, I don't think so. Overall, we really enjoyed our selves & recommend Honua Kai to everyone, especially families with children. Also, I rented tons of baby equipment & toys (car seats, high chair, nice wooden crib, baby monitor, strollers....) from Easy Travel www.easytravelhi.com They were wonderful.

A friend had recommended it and we were not let down by their recommendation. We would definitely stay there again on a return trip to Maui! CONDOS: We stayed in a studio ocean-view. It was the perfect size for my mother and I and when we arrived it was clean and well-prepared. We loved the fact that the doors to the balcony open up all the way so that you can gets tons of fresh air if desired. The kitchen was nice and included everything we needed for our stay. The bathroom was lovely -- nice shower and bath, large sink area, etc. The one thing that wasn't ideal was the view. We could see the ocean from our balcony, but because the studio was across the courtyard and the pools from the beach, you're definitely not right up by the ocean. Still a relaxing view though. STAFF: The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The only problem we had with them during our stay was when we got up in the wee hours of the morning to travel to Haleakala and the valet was not there to get our car for us!! We had even asked multiple times the day before to make sure someone was going to be there. We still don't know if he was away from the desk for 20 minutes to smoke, grab food, use the restroom, etc., but it was annoying being told that someone would be there and then having to wait for 20 minutes to get our car. FOOD: We never ate at the restaurant but it looked lovely. We did, however, get food from the caf\u00c3\u00a9 once or twice. Obviously, it was all extremely expensive but it was quite good and a quick way to grab a bite to eat. We found it better to drive into town to the grocery store and just buy food to make from there. BEACH: The beach was lovely, but there isn't a TON of room to relax on it since the strip of sand isn't terrible large. Plus, the places that you can sit out there are on a slope so that's not terribly comfortable. It's a lovely setting though and we even saw turtles and whales right from the beach! POOLS: The pools were lovely. We went in January so it wasn't terrible crowded and not hard to find a pool chair. I could see it being more of a problem when it was more crowded.

We stayed over the Thanksgiving week in a two bedroom suite. Heads-up, it was SUPER WINDY and the beach is rocky so any water time for the kids was at the pool, and even then it was chilly. But hey, it was November. We did find more success (no wind) so we could paddle board when we ventured out to Puamana Beach and Launui Poko and better baby-in-the-water time at \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBaby Beach\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 closer to Lahina. When asking about local food options the concierge, while helpful, seemed to direct us to places for \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctourists\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was annoying. We ended up hitting up the Foodland and Fish Market instead. We were dinged a couple of times for having things on the lani. They talk about the lani being an extension of the living space and I do understand why they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want them all \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcjunked up\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 but it felt a little off-putting and sterile, like we really couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t LIVE there. Obviously someone was annoyed by the 'clutter' - a few toys and drying bathing suits on chairs tucked under the table. AND - it felt creepy to know we were being watched. There are washer dryers but no simple clothes racks or retractable lines in the bathrooms which would offer a great alternative instead of dinging guests. All the kids were on different schedules so it was nice to have the option for some to be napping and others to be out doing stuff. There are a lot of beautiful common spaces but they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to get much use, maybe due to there being no shade? It would have been nice to be able to enjoy the grounds and not have to bake in the sun. We hit up Dukes a few times and they were great at accommodating our large party. The Thanksgiving dinner was good. We had better luck with fish we bought and cooked ourselves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was fresher. The kitchens were well appointed and the rooms/beds were EXCELLENT. No problems with noise from the halls or other rooms. Because of the kids and needing some gear, we went with the recommendation of the concierge and used akamaimothers.com - they were FANTASTIC! Beach toys and high chair/bouncy chair! We also rented the beach package (2 folding chairs, snorkel gear, cooler and umbrella) from Honua Kai and bareley used it since we didn't use the property beach. When we ventured out to the other beaches we sat on our own travel towels and found natural shade. Probably didn't need to spend the extra $100 for that. Overall it was a relaxing, modern and well appointed place to have a large family gathering with small children.

Two giant towers frame a massive pool/garden complex that includes a BBQ facility, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lazy river\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, gardens, waterfalls, and enough green space to allow a small army to catch their share of the day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rays. There are two ways to book accommodations \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right through the resort itself just as if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re booking a suite at a hotel, or through a property management company specializing in vacation rental properties. You will pay more by booking directly through the resort; however, booking through the resort also includes amenities like maid service. If you book through a property developer all you pay for is the accommodation \u00e2\u20ac\u201c \u00e2\u20ac\u0153extras\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd like a cleaning service come at a hefty premium. We did book through a property manager, and the inconvenience of having to wash towels a couple of times through the week was of small concern considering the money we saved. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t speak categorically for every single unit in the resort, but my belief is that this is a condominium-style complex rather than a traditional hotel. Size of the accommodations range from a relatively cozy studio suite and the largest units come with several bedrooms and more than one bathroom, and are capable of accommodating large families. All come with fully-equipped kitchens, five Bosch appliances, full bathroom, a sitting room, and a balcony. The price of a unit obviously depends upon its size and the view. Some of the larger \u00e2\u20ac\u0153premium\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd accommodations also have their own BBQ grills right on their patios or balconies. Check-in was no more or no less onerous than checking in to a regular hotel; however, each tower had its own check-in desk. Determine whether you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re booked in to Konea or Hokulani , and proceed to the check-in at that tower. Underground parking is included in the rate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c at least, it was for our booking. There is no restaurant in the complex per se, but Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Beach House is located on the property next to the beach, and a small deli-style market is located in the Hokulani tower. The food is excellent, but both are pricey \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the kinds of prices that a resort can charge a captive market. However, there is a market directly across the street, and a Safeway at the north end of Lahaina. To put it in perspective \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we paid $85 for breakfast for four at Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Following the breakfast we went to Safeway and spent $65 for groceries that enabled us to cook breakfast for ourselves for the next six mornings. I can understand not wanting to cook while on vacation, but this was a no-brainer for us. We could make breakfast and clean up in a half hour, while breakfast at Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s took almost an hour by the time we walked to the restaurant, ordered and ate the meal, and then walked back to the suite. And it cost us about 1/5 what it would have to eat at Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s every morning. Each tower has its own small but well-equipped fitness centre \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no complaints there at all. The beach activity centre also looked very popular, although we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t avail ourselves of its services. To conclude, the Honua Kai is very well located for enjoying the Lahaina-Kapalua corridor. Restaurants and amenities abound all over the area. The beach is large and clean with great views out over Lanai.

We ventured to the Wailea area for a few days and there was no wind at all. Overall: Besides the wind, Honua Kai is a great place to stay. Perhaps the wind is only an issue during the fall/winter months? But based on this experience and the wind factor alone, I cannot recommend Honua Kai nor would I probably stay there in the future.

We honeymooned in Maui and spent 9 nights at Honua Kai in unit HH0424 in the HH building. The staff and service are excellent.

They also ensured we had plenty of complimentary shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, body wash, and dishwasher/laundry detergent. The room was great and the suite amenities (full kitchen w/ appliances and cook/serving ware plus washer/drier unit) cut down on luggage and saved us a ton of money and time spent eating out. As an aside, we found that it would be cheaper to buy groceries at the Safeway in Lahaina/Kaanapali than at Walmart or Costco (at least for two people) as long as you have/sign up for a frequent shopper card (free). Back at the Honua Kai, the grills available, though slightly away from the main lobby, are great and convenient. There is an amazingly friendly black/white cat that loves to hang out (not beg) around the grill. The cost relative to other high end hotels (Westin, etc.) is low and value higher in our minds. The grounds are immaculate. The snorkelling right off the adjacent beach and headed south is great as well as the short 20 minute walk to the famed Black Rock did not disappoint. We had a one-bed mountain view suite and it was great waking up to the sunrise over West Maui Mountain. As a note, some people may find the din of traffic slightly annoying on the east side rooms as these face the main highway passing through West Maui but they are at least 200 yards away and were not a bother to us. Also, contrary to most hotels, the rooms next to the elevator corridors were as quiet as other rooms would be many doors away.

The Unit was stocked with beach chairs and toys and all the necessities like dishsoap, dishwasher soap and laundry detergant, cleaning products/vacuum, broom, etc. Cupboards even had spices, oils, etc. so we didn't need to buy any of that.

The hot tubs were also a huge hit - not too hot for kids with the bubbles off. We had coffee at the market every morning. After the first day they remembered our names and orders. The kids helped feed the Koi fish most mornings. We ate several times at Dukes - awesome location and reasonably priced with a large enough menu that you weren't eating the same things each time.

The first room they gave us was facing a new construction site next door. I wouldn't mind a park, a garden, walkpaths, but a construction? NO. So I called them and asked for another room. They gave me a room in the other building, so walked there and checked it out. It was on the ground floor, but at least it looks at a little pool and big grass area. So we took it, but they didn't offer any help for our luggages to move to the other building and only gave a small apology for the 1st room's view. The front lady sounded like she doesn't know the some rooms look at a construction site (which I don't really believe). The room itself was big. Ours was the 1-bedroom, but we had 1.5 living room, with 3 tvs. The bathroom was big. It kind of reminds me of the suites in Las Vegas.

The service, location, facilities, etc... were all wonderful! I choose this based on the comments here on Tripadvisor and let me tell you that you will not be disappointed! We spent out first 5 nights at Honua Kai and loved every moment of it and are already talking about when we will go back. I have stayed at other Kaanapalli area hotels and this hotel has the best and most thought out landscaping and grounds! We walked to other hotels and looked at others in the area and we kept saying that the Honua Kai was the best one. First off like I already mentioned the grounds..... WOW.... very lush and tropical and beautifully planned. So many pools to chose from. The beautiful water falls thru out the pool, hidden gem hot tubs and then the water slide. I loved the design instead of other hotels where everyone sits around the pool and sees one other this is all curvy with so many choices to sit and different views to look at! Second the lanais are too die for! By far some of the biggest lanai's we saw. The Westin Kaanapalli Villas are next to the HOnua Kai and those lanai's are tiny.... they even had one that barely 2 people could sit on. The hOnua Kai lanai's expand the entire length of the living room and to top it off they completely slide wide open on both sides and brings the outdoors in. There is a dining table with 4 chairs, 2 sitting chairs and a table and still plenty of space. And the banister was all glass so nothing blocks your awesome view! Third loved that the property was big yet they managed to make it feel initimate and not huge. Some hotels it feels like it takes 20 minutes to walk from the pool to your room.... here it did not yet the grounds are huge. A major plus with the 2 towers was that each tower had their own parking garage with close parking to the elevators (if you do not want to use valet). Now for the rooms..... beautiful! We had a 1 bedroom Oceanview room and it was just lovely! The kitchen was beautiful and fully stocked, the bedrooms were very nice and the beds very comfy! As for the bathrooms they are huge! The only negative I have is that there is not enough closet space or dresser space... I ended up using the closet in the living room area while my husband used the one in the bedroom. After our 6 days I was sad to leave and head over to Wailea.... even wanted to cancel our hotel there and stay the remaining part of the stay at the Honua Kai! You will not be disappointed if you chose this hotel. I know from other reviews I was leery on the kid situation as I was traveling with my husband to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.... yes there were so kids but I di dnot find it bad at all! If you do not like it they have an adult pool so no worries! I would also suggest if you want to bring your own cocktails down to the pool no one frowns upon it.... just keep it in a cooler bag and make sure to pick up some plastic cups!! There is a Safeway grocery store about 3 miles from the hotel you can stock up on beer, wine, cocktails! Another suggesstion.... the hotel has grills you can use. Go down the street to The Fish Market and pick up some fresh fish (caught that day) and grill them for a nice dinner at the resort and eat on your lanai or at the beach. Also the coffee they put in the rooms is to die for!!!!!", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Condo Resort\u201d", "Author": "cbpalla", "ReviewID": "UR121667932", "Content": "We stayed in a one bedroom condo.

Since Honua Kai was #1 for Lahiana, it was our choice. Got a great deal through Costco travel for a 1 bedroom partial ocean view condo. One snag we experienced is we booked a \"1 bedroom\" but ended up getting a \"studio\" instead. Not sure if the mix-up was Costco's fault or Honua Kai's, but since it was just my husband and myself traveling it was not a big deal. We stayed in room 231 in the Konea tower. We requested a higher up floor but they claimed this was the best they could do. We could (barely) see the ocean peaking through the palm trees in the view but it was still a WAY better view than the \"mountain\" (aka, sewage plant) view. The good: EXCELLENT place to stay, the room was very clean, modern and well done. We had maid service every day to replace towels and clean a bit, they changed the sheets every 3 days. Everyday they brought more laundry and dish detergents if you needed them as well as more coffee. Location was pretty good but not ideal. I did not experience the \"cold spots\" other reviewers complained about. It would be better to be further south, more towards black rock. Didn't go in the pools, they were packed with children. If I had kids I would DEF return here as having laundry and a kitchen would be ideal. The beach was lovely, beautiful views. VERY rocky, do not enter water without water shoes or snorkel fins. We did snorkel off of the beach here and and saw many sea turtles. Spinner dolphins were hanging out more south down at Black Rock (they travel in pods of HUNDREDS, if you see spinner dolphins you will see LOTS of spinner dolphins). Dukes was pretty good. I enjoyed dining early and getting the $25 tasting menu. One tip: I ordered my filet \"medium\" and it came \"well\", so maybe order \"Medium rare\" if you want a real medium. The Hula Pie is awesome! Skip the risotto. My husband fell inlove with the Maui brewing company bikini blonde ale. The girls who are the hostesses are TERRIBLE but ignore them... once you get past those young d-bags the servers are nice. The bad: smokers!!!! This is a NON-SMOKING resort, why do smokers have to ruin it??? Despite this being a strict non-smoking place we had smokers in the room next door to us who chain smoked on their balcony. THIS IS NOT ALLOWED. If by chance you are trapped next to a smoker, complain often. The resort will ask them to stop and tell them it's not allowed (and allegedly, hit them with hefty $$$ cleaning fees for smoking) but the smokers generally put their cigs out when the management is there and then light up again as soon as they leave. I know smokers have the right to smoke, but not at a non-smoking resort. Hawaiian law dictates smokers must be 30' away from a public building to light up. PLEASE, if you are a smoker stay someplace that actually allows it instead of subjecting non-smokers to the health impacts of your cigarettes. Yes, I am a balcony over but I can smell your cigarette smoke like you are 2' away from me. It is disgusting. The turds in room 229 and their smoking ruined the last 3 days we spent here as we could not enjoy our own balcony. All in all, we had a lovely stay (minus the smokers) and we would probably stay here again.

The room was clean and really very nice with washer/dryer/jet tub/shower, very nice tile work, and most everything you would need in the kitchen to make meals, drinks. The hotel even provides, dish soap, paper towels, coffee and filters, laundry detergent, bounce, shampoo, lotion, conditioner from Aveda, and great hair dryers (really, you don't need to bring yours~) The lanai was furnished with enough chair space and tables for 6 of us. The 2 bedroom was very nice, very clean, and had the same ammenities but it came with WIND and when I say wind really it is like a hurricane, there is no way anyone could have sat out on the lanai as you could barely even open the door without blowing away.

After reading reviews on Trip Advisor, I started searching around for the best place to rent - tihs was August. We had already booked airline tickets for Thanksgiving week. I wanted a very nice 1 bedroom place with a reasonable price in Ka'anapali. I finally decided on Honua Kai. But, then I found i difficult to find a 1 bedroom unit! I finally found a studio for a very reasonable price through Harris Realty for the 3 of us - 2 adults and one 7 year old. Melissa of Harris Hawaii Property Management (www.harrishawaii.com) was very professional and easy to deal with, and answered all my questions before I booked my unit - #221 Konea Tower. BTW, their rates were less expensive than going through Honua Kai direct. The only additional fee we had to pay was for parking ($10/day). We arrived in the evening, and Brooke, from Harris Hawaii, greeted us as soon as we got out of the car (I called him 15 minutes earlier, and he gave us some info about the resort, and then took us upstairs to our unit and made sure we were all set before leaving. Now, this unit is nestled in the corner of the south inside part of the Tower, and it has a nice view of the courtyard and there is an ocean view as well! I loved this unit! The lanai was my favorite part. The glass folding lanai doors allow you to open them completely, or you can just open the door on the far right. These doors were wonderful! They also had a screen, but we never used the screen - we simply pulled the light curtain closed to keep the little nats out. I sat out there on the lanai every morning with my husband for our breakfast and we also ate out there in the evening. It was on the shady side, which made it quite comfortable. The washer/dryer in the unit was so WONDERFUL to have on vacation - no more trying to wash clothes in the sink! The beach at Honua Kai is quite short from the top of the beach to the water, and there were not a lot of people using it. It did get deep quite fast (10 feet or so), so not great for young children. But, it was very beautiful. We used the pool more, and one of them (at the Konea Tower) was heated. My family really enjoyed the pool! The only thing missing was a bar to order drinks from! We also visited the other tower and the little store they have on the first floor, which was pricey. We ate at Duke's Restaurant the first night we arrived, but were unimpressed. It was expensive and the food was very par. The Times Grocery Market was directly across from the resort, and you can easily walk there (but alas, we always took the car, since we bought more than what we could carry) and we loved the convenience. It's actually about 100 yards away, as there is a parking lot and an empty field that you have to walk past to get to the market. There's also a few other little shops there as well. The gym in the Konea Tower was nice, except it did get crowded at times. My husband thought it was too warm in the gym, especially with more people in it, but I was fine. I used it just once. There were only 3 treadmills, and these were used the whole time I was there. They had free weights, other aerobic equipment, as well as standard gym equipment. The grounds of the Honua Kai were well manicured and gave a very nice resort feel to the entire place. They had a large fire pit at the Konea Tower. The other tower had a nice fishpond. There is a concierge available, but I didn't really use them, except to ask a favor, which the concierge gladly did for me. There is also a front desk person, but I only interacted with him to pay for my parking at the beginning of my stay. There were a few minor negatives about Honua Kai, but these are not related to the specific unit we rented. First, the BBQs were sometimes very difficult to start. Sometimes, it wouldn't start at all. They cleaned the BBQs every day, but they were very difficult to light. We came across this problem both nights we wanted to BBQ. Other people around us were also unable to light the BBQ as well. Also, the Bosch dishwasher is noisy, compared to the dishwasher we have at home (all units have the same appliances). Considering we had a studio, it was more obvious to us. During this time, we did experience more windy conditions at the beach than what we expected. But, this seemed to be prevalent in the Whaler's Village area as well. We went up north to Kapula and it was REALLY WINDY there - glad we did not stay up there! Overall, I really enjoyed this condo experience. I see this place more as a hybrid. It has a resort feel, but the units are condos. This made for a very good experience, since we were so used to staying at hotel resorts. This place is very new - opened around 2010, and many units are still being sold, and we enjoyed having brand new everything all around us. The place was also quiet. There didn't seem to be many people around, and really the most people we ever saw were at the Duke's Restaurant.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Costa Mesa, California", "Title": "\u201cTonae at the Front Desk\u201d", "Author": "Niki M", "ReviewID": "UR121301213", "Content": "My family just returned from the Honua Kai over the Thanksgiving Holiday.

The resort also had a coffee shop that had groceries and paninis and salads that was pretty good. The resort had grills that some people used at night. The coffee shop sold New York Strip steaks and mahi mahi that you could grill out there. There was usually lots of people out there grilling so sometimes you had to wait.

It's is always windy here and on days when it's calm and sunny in Lahaini or Kihei, it's windy and sometimes raining here. The resort itself is nice and the rooms are very well decorated and I don't have any complaints about the resort itself. I just wanted to advise other travelers so that they know what they're getting when they come here. We are traveling with friends who have never been to Maui and and they are SO bummed that it isn't hot here. They didn't rent a car because all they wanted to do was lounge by the pool or at the beach but it's too cold so they ended up renting a car to go to other beaches in the area.

Everyday it was just wind, wind and more wind nonstop. I'm talking activity cancelling wind. Yes, activities we booked like the zipline were cancelled, then rescheduled, then cancelled again due to wind. I didn't notice any adult pool as advertised, there were children in every pool. I think this is more geared toward families and/or a couple with small children. No nightlife at all. Seemed at 9pm to 9:30 everynight someone pulled the plug out and it was just silent. So quiet one day an elderly man, 60's I'd say; spoke to me and said, \"This place is quiet, I been here 2 days and I I feel like I'm in a hospital\". If you want silence then this is your place! In all we wouldn't recommend for couples. I would say families or if you have small children this would be a great spot for you.

It seems as if their neighbors began to build but didn't finish so there is this big green fence as you pull in. Valet guys were great, good service. You can self park which is included in the daily resort fee of $25.00. Front desk was so, so service. I felt like I was bugging them when I called or stopped by. The back of the grounds are beautiful. The lanais are all glass which makes for great views. I felt like their main goals may have been to sell their condos, so \"guests\" did not seem like a priority. The condos were beautiful, great furniture. Housekeeping SUCKED! The first day they skipped us all together and then I found out that they only do a \"modified\" housekeeping daily then a deep cleaning every 3rd day. I would have rented from VRBO if I had know this. Part of what I wanted was housekeeping on my vacation. They never cleaned the bathtubs or the showers, which were full of sand from our beach outings. The appliances were \"top of the line\" but never worked quite right. This included both the dishwasher and the dryer (it never fully dried). They came out to fix them, but kinda just gave up (another part of the appeal was the washer/dryer). The pool... Was beautiful, but not so great if you want to hang out and watch the kids. There were too many little areas and little pools. For our needs it would of been better to have one big pool. No relaxing there. Also, I never got any poolside service and you are not supposed to bring your own drinks so...? Beach... was a great sandy beach with snorkeling. The little market... Fabulous!

Second, this hotel shuts down at about 12 AM. If you arrive after this time we found that there was no one to valet vehicles and the front desk was empty. The $25 per day resort fee included several items that are sometimes included in other resort room prices, One exception was the complimetary dishwasher soap and laundry starter package.

The added housekeeping service was worth it. Overall the place was very nice. I would probably book here again. We rented a one bedroom mountain view on the 8th floor of Konea. We had a small view of the ocean if we positioned the chairs right. I liked this tower and would ask for it again. Complaints and pros: the bathtub stopper was broken. We had them come fix it and they showed up within 5 minutes of calling. They semi-fixed it. Having a bath was not really a relaxing one because the hot water runs out 1/2 way through. Normally, I would not care, but this particular day I had a very bad headache. Water was freezing. Dryer was crappy. Semi dried the clothing. Housekeeping was excellent. They replenished supplies even when not needed. Hotel staff was amazing. If they see you they make sure they greet you. I was impressed. Pool service as noted by other people is lacking. When you want a drink you have to find the waitress most of the time. Location was good and bad. Because of parking in Kaanapali and Napili you need to get up early to find a parking spot if you want to get a free one without too much walking. If we wanted to go to those areas we were out around 8:00-8:30 am which meant we had to wake up and go/ not that relaxing. The one day we waited until 9 we had to walk a LONG way to Black Rock with our things and on the way back it was very hot carrying beach gear and a child. The beach outside the resort is great IF the waves are small. Walk a little ways and there is no coral. Very peaceful because there are less people. I did notice the wind and when it was windy we did not enjoy the pool. However there were many days that it was not windy. On the windy days, it was windy at other places too. We noticed the smell that others mention. It did not ruin our stay at all. I think it probably smells at all the hotels along this stretch.

PROS: - Ideal location, 5 miles to majority of great restaurants - Great value on a per night basis for a nice hotel anywhere - Great to have full kitchen, laundry, and separate bedroom - Beautiful manicured beach and grounds - Quiet location, comfy bed - Maid service loaded and unloaded dishwasher most days, always had enough toiletries, and towels - Duke's Restaurant on-site did not dissapoint - Some great service providers: Erin/Hali at Duke's pool side, Ben the bellman, Jake at Maui Conceirge, and Karen/Lynn :) at Aina Gourmet were great. CONS: - Its referred to as a Hotel and Spa - there is no spa on-site - These are condos with contracted management services - service is good, not great, in some areas. To be called #1, the frontdesk needs to work lots harder. - There is no laundry/dry cleaning service on-site - Bathroom was small, very average, dont be fooled by large bathroom photos - Bathroom shower could have been much much cleaner - everyday - Housekeeping comes early - most days before 8:30am HST - The location is windy, which might bother some people, this is noted in another review. I - No acknowledgement our honeymoon although noted/confirmed during our reservation - No turndown service - Room was often musty/dry - Sufur smell noted many days outside - not sure if this was a sewerage plant indicated by one reviewer or island related Overall, we spent 10 nights/11 days at Honua Kai in a 1 bedroom moutain view suite. It is a very nice hotel. Personally, I think it is MUCH nicer than many of the hotels in the area as most of the area hotels are old and very dated. While I would recommend the hotel...especially for the price point, I do wish I wasnt fooled by the photos of huge rooms / elaborate views.

I have previously stayed in Maui before, at the Makena Resort, and also at Hale Mahina with extended family. After much research, my sister and I decided to stay at Honua Kai. I have to say that the start of my vacation was not great, as our flight had been delayed by 10 hours, so when we got to HK it was about 1 am local time, we got checked in and basically went to the room and crashed. The next day when we actually got a look at our room, it had some really odd features, most notably the lack of a shower door or curtain, and no tub. It didnt take me long to figure out that we had been put in a handicapped room, probably wouldnt have been a big deal except I like to relax in a hot bath when on vacation, so we went down and asked about changing rooms. I honestly did not think it would be an issue, as so many other travellers raved about being upgraded to a better room without even asking, but apparently they take issue with booking outside of their own website, because I got the impression that I was causing them an inconvenience to be moved to another room similar to my own. Now, be aware that I am no fool, I checked in advance on multiple sites, including their own, for availability for the entire length of my stay to see if they still had any vacancies, and they most definitely did on every site checked, so I knew that it should not be an issue to change rooms. At first we were offered a mountain view room, which would've been okay if thats what I reserved, but I paid extra for the partial oceanview, so I declined. At this point they informed me that they were completely booked, which I knew was a lie, but they magically came up with another room that was the same as we booked, but it had very little view, and a community style lanai, I am wondering now if it was possible a model they use to show potential buyers, as the setup was different as well. After a little more fuss, and about 2 hours of our time, we finally were sent to the Konea tower, where we got a room that we should have been in the entire time, about the same view as the original room, just with the bathtub and enclosed shower I wanted. Finally we were able to unpack and unwind. I have to say that this resort is beautiful. The grounds are meticulously maintained, and the rooms were very nice, and the lanai had wonderful folding doors that allowed the breeze to come in. I dont really have any complaints about the rooms, except for all the appliances are H.E., and they definitely have an odd scent to them, probably because of the recycled water used. The dishwasher, washer, and dryer all took a ridiculous amount of time to run, and were not as quiet as I had thought they would be for newer appliances. When booking this resort, my only hangup was the description of the beach fronting the hotel. I have heard many different descriptions, and also have read Maui Revealed multiple times, and was worried about not having a good place to swim. My sister even called the resort to inquire about what the nearshore waters were like. We went out one morning to check it out, and unfortunately we couldnt get past the rocky shore. Let me tell you, for some folks it may not be a big deal, but for me, the only thing I want out of my beach is a sandy bottom. This was not the place for it. If you do stay here, and want to use this beach, you absolutely MUST purchase a pair of river shoes, or reef shoes as they are better known. I guess I was spoiled by Maluaka Beach in south Maui when staying at Makena Resort, it has crystal clear waters and a padded sandy bottom. We did try to walk down past the Westin Villas to see about the south end of North Kaanapali beach, but it didnt seem much better. The beach was pretty much all I was after in choosing an area to stay, my sister was all about the room and resort, and HK was picked number 1 on here, so she convinced me to stay here. I agreed mostly because there is alot more action up this way compared to south Maui, especially Wailea, and we figured it would be better to stay here instead of driving back and forth, but we ended up driving down to Keawakapu every morning for the beach. For anybody that wants to do some snorkeling though, HK is probably an ideal place, as there seemed to be alot of coral in the nearshore waters. I would probably consider staying here again, it was a nice resort, just not an ideal beach for my liking. I loved Dukes on the resort, the beachside tacos were outstanding, its worth the money! I guess after reading other reviews, I had a different idea about how the resort and its employees would be, most of the stay was great, it just got off to a rocky start. There were many employees who were super friendly and helpful. others not at all, a mixed bag, I guess.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Windsor, Canada", "Title": "\u201cDon't look elsewhere , This is it !!!\u201d", "Author": "jsharron1", "ReviewID": "UR119561112", "Content": "I spent hours looking for a place to stay on Maui after our week long cruise of the islands.

Found a great deal for a 1 bedroom + den on vrbo so decided to try this place out for 2 weeks the first of Sept. Pros - the grounds are amazing.

There is apparently no policy that certain pools are for kids and others are for adults so the parents are floating their babies all over the place, in every single pool. If you want to relax in the pool and enjoy the view, forget it. Not gonna happen.

Considering our favorite spots in Maui's Kaanapali and Waile areas were astronomical, we gambled on Honua Kai and its very reasonable rates. We paid about $1295 through Costco for a five-night mountain view room. Just walking into this place gives you good vibes. Once we got to the room, it had the WOW factor. Beautiful suite with a very well appointed kitchen and washer and dryer. Two great TVs with dozens of channels including ESPN, HBO and other premium channels. You don't see that in many places. As many people do upon arrival in Maui, we raided the Costco near the airport and picked up water, beer, bread and other essentials. The hotel has two twin towers with very similar amenities. Pools are nice, but very restrictive. No outside alcohol allowed, and they patrol hard. Of course, they do offer beer for $5 domestic and $6.50 for premium brews. Not bad for a big resort, wrong. You get an eight ounce plastic cup that allows the beer to get warm quite fast. Also, lounge chairs are nice looking and go with the rattan motif, but boy are they uncomfortable. They're not flexible at all! And here's the kicker, you get a side show with mice running from hedge to hedge and scrambling right through... under and between chairs. There's a $25 daily resort fee. You get valet parking for it and free internet connection, either WiFi or with a cable. But bring your computer. We tried to look something up on the internet, no dice.

And the wind really only picks up from 3-5pm The kids - There will be a few kids, deal with it. There are tons of places to camp out by the pool and beach. if you want privacy you can find it. The staff - They are perfectly friendly but don't expect to be dotted on. It's a condo association, not a luxury retreat. The location - Right across the road from a great market, pizza paradiso, and others and 5 minutes away from whalres village, Napili bay, etc. The restaurant - It's good enough. Not a 5 star restaurant, but a great happy hour, The cajun ahi fish tacos are the best on the island. The bar tenderes are solid, food is decent. The spa - it doesn't exist yet - there are spas in every direction around here. Take a walk. The beach. It's really rocky directly out front, but 10 feet left of the left most tower (beach facing) its very sandy and totally swimmable. There is really good snorkeling right there and I am an avid diver. Almost as good as black rock down the road. The rooms. Impeccable. We stayed in 221 - a studio in the far back of the building, but with a central ocean view. This room was perfect for us. great access, great views, and the property manager (from Harris's) was awesome and friendly. Parking - it's $10 a day for valet or you can get a key card. Super easy. The gym - top of the line I would stay here again in a New York minute. We walked by the Westin, Sheraton, Marriott and every beach club starting with Kana and ending with Ali - This place is really nice in comparison. Don't listen to the wankers - unless you have a silver spoon attitude you will be perfectly happy here. If you want to pay $35 to park, and $30 for a chair, and $15 for every cocktail, go stay at the 4 seasons.

We were very pleased with the physical facility. The two bedroom unit was comfortably furnished and the kitchen was stocked with quality cookware. We had an L-shaped balcony with a great ocean view. In addition to chaise lounges on the balcony, there was a large table on the balcony, giving us the option to eat outside. Although our unit did not have a BBQ on the patio, there are several BBQs available on the premises for guest to use. We were four women (2 married and 2 single) who each wanted a bed. Sleeping six nights on a sleeper sofa in the living room was not an acceptable option. The unit had a king in the master bedroom that could not be separated into two twins and a king in the second bedroom that could be separated into two twins. It took several phone calls before we were able to get a roll-away with two (at our request) mattresses. Two other problems were quickly addressed even though our phone calls about the problems were made after 9:00 p.m.: (1) The air conditioner was set too low and a manual override was necessary and (2) the refrigerator was not cold. When we arrived, there was a basket with dishwashing liquid, dishwasher powder, laundry detergent, kitchen towels, and a sponge. These items were replaced, as needed. Housekeeping, however, was not good about replacing face towels in one of the bathrooms. A note suggests that we hang up towels we will re-use. No problem, if there were towel racks! Exiting the airport, we stopped at Costco and stocked up on bottled water, snacks, and food for eating in. There is a Safeway as you drive north toward the resort on Highway 30. Because Safeway and Vons (a California chain) are related, you can use your Vons card at Safeway. The resort has two driveway entrances. Directly across from the northernmost driveway is Times Market. Times' prices are slightly less than Safeway's prices. Times is a 2-3 block walk away. For those familiar with the L & L Hawaiian BBQ restaurant chain, the chain has a restaurant in the Times shopping center Resort fee: We asked and were given a small slip of paper listing what is covered by the $25/day resort fee. Tips are not included. Thus, if you use the valet service, which is included in the resort fee, remember to tip the valet. Except when we checked in and checked out and availed ourselves of the valet services for our luggage, we self-parked.

Konea is a quieter than the main building since its mostly filled with visitors rather than owners. The grounds were immaculate, just as it was during our last visit. We enjoyed a nice resort view suite with all the amenities of home. Since this was our second time, we knew to bring some of the little things, such as spices and specialty food items that can really start to add up at the super market, which is within walking distance. Our room was clean and comfortable. Just an FYI- the spa is not open yet, not so sure when it will be. The beach is swimmable and lovely, but not little kid friendly with coral, strong currents, and a sudden drop in depth close to shore. The pools were nice and clean. The infinity pool was closed for remodeling during our visit. Konea has underground parking (not sure if the other building does) with elevators that take you straight to your floor.

My 4 stars are for the property, NOT the service, I have heard from other guests while there, that you may get a break on the rate if you book through VRBO. Each unit is independently owned, but unlike other resorts, there seems to be a lot of cohesion in the resort, so there is no need to pick a particular unit, they all seem fairly standard from what we saw. Our unit was very spacious with a HUGE patio that added even more space. We went to Costco on our way to the resort, so we had pretty much everything we needed for a week. Last year we stayed at the Westin and we liked this space better, 1) it was larger and 2) the resort itself was less crowded. The pool was awesome! Fun water slide, there's a semi lazy river (it doesn't go all the way around), lots of space, easy to find lounge chairs with and without shade. Duke's is a pretty decent onsite restaurant, there were a few nights they had live music. The grounds were nicely kept and quite beautiful. The beach is a little small but my husband and I like to explore so we only enjoyed it one day. The only issues we had with the resort was the service. We had to wait almost 3 hours to check in, which would've been ok if the front desk would have just told us that but instead they kept telling us it would be 15 more minutes...for 3 hours! If we didn't have our 15 month old, I don't think it would've phased us, but with a baby it started to become a problem. It seemed like there was a big communication issue between the front desk and housekeeping, each department kept blaming the other for the problem instead of just fixing the problem. The other issue I had was that we had requested a crib (just FYI they charge for this service) and by the time we got into our room, they had no more available. They had promised that they would get one for us the next day by renting it. It never happened. By the 3rd day I got sick of calling and our daughter seemed ok in her make shift bed so I just let it go. Overall, I would stay here again, it was convenient, spacious and nicely done.

If this place were 100 percent full, it might bother me a little more. Not a ton of service at the pool. Waitress comes around every 10 to 15 minutes. There is a big difference in service compared to a regular resort so we kinda noticed that. No maid service at all since we rented from an owner. We actually like having our room cleaned everyday and a turn down service. If you rent from the hotel, I think you can get your room cleaned. $10 dollars a day to park your own rental car. But that does give you access to the gym and ice machine. Rooms are frickin great. I seriously think they have some of the best rooms and balcony's in Maui...LG plasma's in every room and a Blue Ray DVD player in the living room. Sweet folding doors that open up to the balcony. We spent the day at the new Westin with our friends and I liked our pool better. We played football and brought down a little stereo to listen to music and had a great time at the pool everyday. You can bring your own alcohol to the pool and they wont bother you at all. Just bring a dixie cup or something else to put your drink in. Just dont bring a beer bottle or a glass cup and you will be fine. Hint: Stop at Costco next to the airport and buy your milk, liquor and beer. Very cheap compared to any other place on the island. Overall we really liked the resort. We liked the Marriot a little better because of the service and location. I think this place has better rooms and definetly better balcony's but like I said before we kinda missed the service. I also think the Marriot on the other side of Black Rock has the best beach location in all of Kannapali beach area. I would stay here again.

Granite counters, stainless appliances, a huge ensuite bath, a flat screen with HD TV and Blu Ray plus free wireless internet were all as advertised. We loved the option of either using one of the many pools and hot tubs or just crossing the boardwalk and relaxing on the sandy beach. The boardwalk was also handy for morning walks along the other resorts of Ka'anapali down to Black Rock and Whaler's Village. Lahaina is a short drive away but most nights we ended up at Duke's for happy hour to listen to a little live Hawaiian music before returning to our lanai to consider what we might create that night in the kitchen.

It was our second time there, and we plan to go back in December, so obviously we love it. The rooms are gorgeous, and pools always have empty chairs. People who work there are typically very friendly, especially the valet guys. Our only problem this time was with housekeeping. We booked through Expedia, so daily housekeeping is included. The information in the room said they would do various things (wash coffee-pot, start dishwasher, etc.) which they didn't do at all while we were there. What they did was make the beds. They took away dirty towels when we left them in the tub (as instructed) but didn't always replace them. That was it. When we checked into the room, we found the lanai was really dirty - clearly hadn't been cleaned from the last folks. We called housekeeping and stopped at the front desk to ask for a cleaning 3 times, had promises that it would be taken care of, but nobody ever did it. We finally gave up, and ended up just not using the lanai, which was a shame. Otherwise, it was a lovely stay, as always. General comments: Dukes is good for happy hour, but breakfast is not great there. We tried it twice and were disappointed both times. Food was cold and service was not much better. Happy hour prices on drinks and snacks are good, though. Pizza Paradiso across the street by the Times Market is good food, especially for take-out. We picked up gyros there a couple of times, and they were great. The beach in front of the hotel is also pretty rocky and not easy to swim or snorkel comfortably. Walking south helps somewhat, but the beach at Black Rock is far better, and worth the drive. Other good places to eat around there: Pineapple Grill (Kapalua), Plantation House (also Kapalua), the Gazebo for breakfast. We had dinner at Cheeseburger in Paradise, and it was truly awful food. We all were sick afterwards, so I think there was something off with the meat there. We've eaten there in the past without problems, so maybe it was just that one time.

After our stay, I urge you - don't worry about the wind you read about in other reviews - Maui is a windy place and the Honua Kai is generally no more windy than the rest of Kaanaplali. Honestly, if it weren't windy it would be too hot. At no time during my stay was the wind a bother. That said, this place was awesome - the best stay I have had at any hotel in any location. Rooms: Awesome, million dollar + condos complete with high-end everything. If you like luxury and are a hotel snob, you'll be in hog heaven. These units are legit. There are no bad views in my opinion - mountains are beautiful and so is the ocean. There is a constructions site to the south of the resort which (IMO) is not a bad view either. Balconies are huge with a full size dining table and chairs - had most of our meals out there... Location: The best location in my opinion. Close enought to all the hoopla of main Kaanapali if thats your thing. Far enough for some peace and relaxation. Market, a great pizza place (Pizza Paradiso), and some other little stores right across the street. We went back to Pizza Paradiso like 4 times over our 6 day stay (it's that good). Beach: Awesome. Some reviewers complain about the reef coming right up to the water line. That is true directly in front of the resort. Just walk like 30 paces south and you have plenty of sand. My little ones and I played in the water all day long every day. The beach was very nice - clear water, a few waves - perfect really and not too crowded. Pools: Lots of them. We stayed around the one with the slide for the kids. Plenty of lounges - never stressful by the pool as it can be in many resorts. Summary: If you like to relax on your vacation then this resort is for you. This place is so low key and the service is top notch. The facilities are truly 5-Star (even the outdoor BBQ's are Viking, c'mon!) - you won't be dissappointed by the detalis - they thought of everything. The location is great and very convienient and if you have kids, they will have plenty to do with the awesome beach and all the pools. We didn't want to leave. I have already recommended Honua Kai to everyone who will listen and am planning our next visit. If you have the means - get a unit with a out door kitchen (yes, they have those) the lanais are so awesome in the rooms - the only thing mine was lacking was one of those BBQ's... Have to send a special thanks to the manager, Darren - he is the best and took alot of extra time (that he didn't have to) to make sure my family and I were happy with our room. He even took us on a tour of the available rooms for us to choose the one we wanted before checking in. Just cant say enough about the people - thanks to everyone and keep it up.... All of the staff at Honua Kai were super friendly - never intrusive but always there if you needed something.

This wind keeps the weather on Maui stunning (especially in West Maui). Our only minor complaint, there was no adult pool (like there is at Ritz or other high end resorts). So our fault for choosing the busiest family travel month to go on a couples get-away, but it would have been nice to at least escape screaming Tiffany Britney Amber Emma and her brother Cooper Jackson Jefferson for a few minutes.

Here's a summary of what we thought. THE UNIT Outstanding unit with 3 beds and baths directly looking at the ocean...very comfortable and luxurious condo, high end finishes, decor, and appliances, w/d, huge deck with seating and dining table...no complaints. Having read the reviews where the people weren't crazy about their ocean views, we decided to go for an alii unit (full on ocean view), which we felt was a great value when booked through Harris. Brook at Harris was super nice and helpful, btw. SERVICE/AMENITIES The thing that would've come as a surprise if we hadn't read the reviews here is the fact that it's very not really a hotel per se, and you get that sense even more so if you book through vrbo or Harris. Also, not sure it's a spa for that matter. I didn't see the spa. Basically it's two towers with high end condos and many of the amenities seem to be leased out for management by other entities: for example there is a little snack and sundries shop in the adjoining tower (Konea is the newer tower) operated by the I'o restaurant people, all the service at the pool (renting out of snorkels, cabanas and gazebos...gazebos are $62 a day, worth every penny...giving out of towels, etc is done by a company that is independently operated (hence they didn't care that one morning a family was playing music a bit loud in their gazebo). The restaurant on site is Duke's and they provide the pool service, as well. Very yummy, good prices. I don't see the fact that there isn't one common management of everything as a problem...it's just different from a resort where everyone has the same unified service mentality. I think here there isn't a lot of staff and what staff there actually is here assumes you know what you're doing and you're on your own. Not to say they're not friendly. BEACH and POOLS As for the beach, it's not a big one with a lot of shoreline before you hit the water but it's lovely. I was expecting it to be a horrible, rocky, coral covered area from some of the reviews but it was fine. As for the pools, they are shallow (I don't think there was any area above 4 or 5 feet) and oriented towards little kids. The waterslide was a bit of a joke as was the lazy river. LOCATION Very close to Lahaina. Lots of great restaurants and touristy things to do there. If you need groceries, which you surely will if you are staying here, go to Costco on teh way from the airport then stop at Safeway in Lahaina. THE CROWD Tons of families with younger kids. Since our kids are 13 and 11, they were a little older than the average crowd. OVERALL I'm glad we chose this place. Traveling with five people (parents, two kids and a grandma) would have meant that we'd have needed 2 or 3 rooms at a regular hotel and we'd have been obligated to eat out for all meals. Staying here, though it was not inexpensive for the alii unit with 3 bed/bath, still ended up costing a lot less than staying at a regular hotel and we had the freedom to eat in sometimes and get our laundry done. Having stayed at other \"resort\" places with more of a service mentality and fancier poolos maybe spoiled us a little but because we were aware that this wasn't going to be a \"resort\" vacation, this was an excellent experience. Might try something different next time but would still very highly recommend this, especially to younger families.

Hotels had comfort for a price; condos were cheaper and it showed. The Honua Kai has really brought together the best of both. We stayed for two weeks in a one bedroom partial ocean view in Konea tower. Our suite is on the north side of the tower. With a partial ocean view, the only time you see the ocean is when you are on the lanai. With such a huge lanai (table and chairs for four, plus an easy chair, footstool and side table and still plenty of room), that quickly became my favourite place in the suite. The Konea tower has contemporary furnishings (I think the other tower is more \"tropical\"); it is stylish and comfortable. There are ceiling fans in both the bedroom and the living room, which encourages us to keep that glorious folding glass wall open all day. The bedroom has a separate glass door leading to the lanai also; the whole north-facing suite is light and bright. We booked the suite via Expedia, so the booking went through the resort management rather than a private owner. I would consider booking again through an owner, but I didn't really mind paying the $25/day resort fee as I quite like valet parking and on-call service. There have been some uneven reviews about the housekeeping: you get a \"tidy\" (make beds, fold or replace towels, clean kitchen/bathroom counters and remove garbage) daily, and every third day they do a full clean, with vacuuming, new bed linens etc. I found that the service was fine; they missed our room twice but a phone call down to housekeeping had someone up here within 15 minutes and they spiffed the room up right away. We had some online shopping delivered (some places don't ship to Canada, so we took advantage) and bell service was more than friendly and co-operative delivering large boxes. I also needed -- and got -- good assistance from the front desk and the concierge. Housekeeping leaves a basket of 1/4 lb Kona coffee (one each of regular and decaf), coffee filters, dishwashing & dishwasher detergent, laundry soap and kitchen sponge/towels on arrival. Everything but the coffee will be replenished as needed. We went through a lot of detergent and called down for extra to housekeeping a few times; extras were delivered quickly. The usual toiletries are stocked in the bathroom, also. All the products were very good quality. In our two weeks, my family of three ate at restaurants four times in total. Yep, we made good use of that kitchen! Nice to have a water filter and icemaker; didn't need to stock up on bottled water at Costco on the way in. The fridge/freezer are residential size, so you can bring in a normal load of groceries and know that there is room for everything. I did find that the oven takes a long time to preheat...spent an hour trying to accomplish frozen pizza for the teenager. Be forewarned; turn it on early. I also had to get used to the appliances talking back to me...the coffemaker beeps when it's done, the dishwasher beeps when it's done, the oven beeps ...you get the idea. The only thing to be aware of there is the dishwasher; if you turn it on before going to bed it will keep pestering you through the night to unload it after it's finished! Not helpful when you have kids on the sofabed...factor in the two-hour cycle accordingly. There is much more I could say about the kitchen; it is really well fitted out. Aside from the Bosch appliances, there are casserole dishes, a salad spinner, a baking sheet, lasagna pan, grater, kitchen shears...even a cocktail shaker and two martini glasses. Did I mention a blender and a four-slice toaster (thinking of families here...no waiting!). The knives were really sharp, no squished tomatoes. A teakettle, teapot, sugar and cream set. Two cutting boards so you could keep the raw meat area well separate from the veggies. Someone has really put a lot of thought into this. We used the barbeques outside several times (Viking BBQs with granite countertops around them, very posh!) and never once had to wait. There are six available on the Konea side and more close to the other tower. Tools are available at the front desk, but if you don't return them (cleaned) by 10pm they will charge you a $5 rental fee. Wound up just using a fork to turn the steaks so I didn't have to make the return trip after dinner. Okay, I am lazy. The beds were very comfortable. Even my picky teenager liked her sofabed, and such things are normally the bane of her holidays. High quality linens, and the towels were reasonably soft. The bathtub is deep and a good size, but the temperature on the hot water tank is not set high enough to fill the tub more than halfway before the hot water runs out. The air conditioning was really good...not profoundly cold (you can set it at 65 where it will stay for about an hour before defaulting back to 68), but they have balanced the humidity so that the air is not uncomfortably dry. Add in two big (42\"?) flat screen TVs with digital cable (the living room has a blu-ray player) and we were set for serious laziness. The Times Supermarket across the street had about the same size and selection as the Safeway in Lahaina, and I found the prices were comparable but far more convenient. It also had one of those DVD rental machine thingies, which we used a couple of times. The bakery at Times was not the best, but it had a reasonable deli section. The pools were far nicer than any other condo property that I looked at, quite similar to the ones at the Westin Villas. There are four pools, quite shallow as are most pools in modern resorts. The river went to 5' in one area, but 4' was the norm with other shallow areas for little people. The pools are heated, which surprisingly is a good thing in Hawaii, even in the summer. There are four hot tubs (nice after that long flight) and the pool area was rarely very busy. The umbrellas have been bolted to the ground as a precaution against wind, but you can shift your lounge chair around an umbrella if you are seeking shade. The cabanas are rented for $60/day, $30 if you start after lunch, and are yours until 10 pm. That being said, on slow pool days the attendant offered me a cabana for $20 for the afternoon. Being shade-seekers, we were really happy to find that the beach outside had a long, shady area over the sand just a very short walk to the south. The reef and rocks are a short distance from the shoreline; lots of room for kids to splash about in the shallow, sandy part and snorkelling on your doorstep (although I found it got a bit better as you moved toward Black Rock). In a perfect world, what would I change? It would be nice to have a tray to carry stuff to and from the barbeque area, and to have more than exactly four place settings (as soon as breakfast is over, all the dishes are dirty and there are no extras to be had until that 2 hour dishwasher is done!) The glasses get very spotty in the dishwasher, and housekeeping did not provide rinse agent. Minor, minor details in the great scheme of things.

Dealing with Harris was a pleasure and they were very patient in dealing with all of my questions as I was booking the suite.Brooke M. from Harris met us at the front of the Hokulani tower and took me to the front desk to pick up the self-parking parking pass. After that we headed up to the suite and along the way Brooke pointed out all of the amenities that were available to us at the Honua Kai. The suite itself was gorgeous! The pictures of the view from the lanai were understated. The view was actually better than the pictures! We even saw a rainbow over the West Maui mountains! With the lanai doors completely open, the breeze was more than enough to cool the suite without needing the air conditioning. The suite came with all amenities, towels, cookware, soap, shampoo, dishwasher detergent, laundry soap, beach towels, and even boogie boards and sand toys for our toddlers! Being on the top floor without another suite above us gave us a feeling of privacy and exclusivity that we did not anticipate. Being close to the elevator (and not hearing it!) was very convenient in getting out for our activities at the beach, pools and the garage. In general, it was very windy during our stay there but the suite and the location more than made up for any deficiencies. Way better for us compared to staying at a hotel. Not having to deal with hotel staff or front desk was a nice thing for us. We didn't eat at Duke's as there weren't too many options available for us vegetarians unless your meal consisted of sides only which didn't seem all that special. The convenience of the kitchen helped us a lot with the meals for the kids and we probably saved a bundle not eating out. Definitely didn't miss any of the conveniences or amenities of a hotel. The beach in front of Honua Kai is much better than what has been described by a number of other reviewers. The better spot is a little further south than directly in front of Honua Kai and the best part is that it was not as crowded as some of the other more popular beaches like Kapalua, Napili or DT Fleming. The waves were not too strong or over-powering and we didn't encounter any rocks that other reviewers have written. Way more rocks at Kapalua beach then here. I was able to swim out about 20-25 yards before noticing any rocks. The pools were ok and the kids had a blast there but it was fairly crowded with lots of families and whenever we were there it was very windy to the point where the only warm spot was being in the water!

The kitchen was very well stocked and we could have had a full service meal like Thanksgiving if we chose to :) The condo resort was pretty full, yet it did not feel crowded at all by the pool or even at Duke's where we spent several hours one day while we watched our daughter play in the pool. The pool area was really nice with plenty of pool options including slides and at least 4 hot tubs. One reviewer mentioned that the water was shallow but that has been our experience at all the outside resorts and hotels we have stayed in here in HI ( a total of 4). They are all shallow with max 5'. The beach area was nice as well, and you could rent chairs if your condo did not provide one. The one negative, but not the properties fault, was that our ice maker did not work and although called the Kaanapali property folks, they did not fix before we left. It is also VERY windy here, and although nice when you have your lanai open and are simply enjoying yourself, it was hard to sit on the beach as the sand would be kicking up quite high and in your eyes. This was not true for other parts of Maui we went to such as Honolua Bay and Wailea area. It seems that where Honua Kai is located does pick up much more wind.

Instead, HK is a newish property with nice, clean grounds in a good location. Although not marketed as a family resort, the majority of guests appear to be families who would most benefit from the kitchen and washer/dryer in each unit. The staff was friendly and helpful. My wife left her phone charger at home, and they searched to find a replacement from their stash. Please note that the spa has yet to be built (slated for the Hokulani building). There are three smallish pools (none more than 4' deep) on the property, including a short waterslide. A number of small jacuzzis dot the grounds. We only went to the pools twice, but never had any issues finding available chaise lounges. Frankly, however, the pool areas looked larger in photos than in person. HK fronts a nice long beach. Depending on the tide, coral is present about 30' from the beach, leaving enough to swim in without worrying about the coral. The upside is that there is decent snorkeling right outside HK, which gets better as you near Black Rock to the south. We saw plenty of fish in the water outside of the adjacent Westin. There is a beachwalk which goes down to Black Rock (not as far as Lahaina). Our unit faced the mountains rather than the ocean, which may have been a blessing in disguise. The buildings are shaped in an open U and (as another reviewer noted) the ocean-facing patios open up to one another, mitigating any sense of privacy (except for the units at the very end). Worse, many of the ocean-facing units were adjacent to the pools, which treated guests to games of Marco Polo well into the night. It may be sour grapes, but I'll take the low highway buzz from the mountain side any day. HK is located across the street from the Times Supermarket and a small strip mall (you can't see it from the property). A few low-priced restaurants (L&L, Ono Kau Kau) are within walking distance. Lahaina is 10 minutes away by car. Several on this and other sites have complained about the wind. Yes, it was windy at HK, but it was also windy in Lahaina, Wailuku, Kahalui and upcountry when we were there. My spin is that it would have been much warmer were it not for the wind. I did unnecessarily buy beach mats which were never used because of the wind. When I win the lottery, I'll book at the Four Seasons.

Comparatively, this place was more expensive including the rental car and the island experience for our family was different. Personally, we enjoyed Oahu much better than Maui since Maui seemed more like visiting someplace in Southern California. The hotel was nice since you have a kitchen to cook and a washer and dryer for you clothes. It would have been nice if they would have had instructions for the washer in the room since there are different slots for the detergent and I had to call the front desk on such a simple item. However, the beds and sofa beds were comfortable, the room furnishing were nice, kitchen items were all nice so it was a good set up for folks who just want to relax at a resort. From looking at all of the resorts in the area, they all look to be fairly nice where you can walk to the beach too, and so the Honua Kai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any better than any other resort in the area. My children loved the pool area, and they have a few different pools so the variety is great for the children to explore. Also the deck with the table and chairs is quite large and so we had a few meals outside dining in this area and it was fun. The one area of weakness was the housekeeping, at the service was too good at times for cleaning. Once I had trouble communicating with housekeeper that on the day we only needed sweeping and garbage, one day the housekeeper said that she would come back with new kitchen towels and she never did, one day we ran out of dishwasher soap, but on the whole these are nuances and not major concerns. But overall, the place it certainly well maintained inside and outside. Overall, I would suggest that since all of the resorts are close together and you need a car to travel anyway, review each resort and see what it appealing to you personally for what you desire and as long as it is price competitive with another resort \u00e2\u20ac\u201c book that resort.

We used to travel extensively as a young couple and enjoyed staying in relatively higher-end properties. Now that we have young children, it's been a real challenge to vacation with a similar level of accommodations. Our children go to bed at 7pm, so it's critical that they be in a room with a door and we have a separate living space, otherwise we end up sitting in the dark from 7pm until our bedtime. The majority of \"suite\" properties have the living and bedroom space in the same area with no wall/door separation. It's certainly possible to get adjoining rooms, but that's not usually guaranteed, and I'm not entirely comfortable with my kids in a whole separate hotel room. Marriott's Residence Inn does a good job functionally, but I wish there were higher end accommodations. The Honua Kai is the PERFECT solution. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! We had a 3 BR/3 BA condo in the Konea tower. This is the newer of the two towers, but is not the main building. If I were to choose, I'd have chosen Hokulani Tower next time, to have closer access to the market, kids club, fish feeding, etc, but not a huge deal. The Konea tower does have the benefit of being the closest to the 3 foot pool which is the warmest, least windy, and the best for preschoolers that can reach the bottom on their own. Each bedroom was beautiful, all the bathrooms were luxuriously appointed. The kitchen impressively had all Viking appliances (two ovens, range, hood, microwave, refrigerator, wine fridge, dishwasher). Big 8-person dining table, huge outdoor deck with outdoor dining and lounge areas. Absolutely gorgeous. The hotel amenities were awesome as well. We rented a high chair, baby bath tub, crib, indoor toys and sand toys. They were all waiting for us when we arrived. The crib was a REAL crib, not just a Pack and Play, and the kids really enjoyed all the toys. At the pool, we also rented an inner tube and a kids' snorkel/fin set that our 3 year old daughter really enjoyed. Duke's restaurant is delicious, their drinks are amazing. While they do have poolside beverage service, it's faster just to go to the bar yourself, the wait staff doesn't really come around that often. Room service is from the Aina market at the hotel, not Duke's, so isn't really worth it. You might as well just go down to the market and order your sandwich yourself. Duke does do takeout though, so it's just an easy 10 minute walk down. The market is \"expensive\" compared to the mainland, but then again, so is the \"normal\" supermarket across the street from the hotel. From a rough estimate, groceries are about 2-3X what they cost on the mainland (as compared to Northern California). Our shopping trips were easily $50-$75 per bag. I think that's just unfortunately part of island living. There is a Costco in Maui right by the airport, but that's an hour drive from the resort, so wasn't worth it for us.

Brooke Moore was fantastic and very easy to work with. The room was exceptional with a separate bedroom and bathroom for the kids (ages 7 and 9) and they even broke the bed into two twins so the kids didn't have to share a king. It has a wonderful kitchen with everything you could need, washer and dryer and, in general, high end furnishings. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in away from home. The lanai was huge and the wall of windows that you could open up was a very nice touch. The entire property was very well maintained and beautiful. A few pointers we learned that may be helpful to some others: 1. This is a great family resort. If you are looking for a quiet couples resort, there may be other that are better. It is also very new. The Konea Tower (Which we stayed in) just opened last year and the other tower opened in 2009 so everything is pretty new. 2. The pools are fantastic, water slide, lots of hot tubs, waterfalls and free form pools. I did not see any that were explicitly only for adults. They also do not have lifegaurds, so the rules are loosely enforced but we saw no disarrary during our time there. 3. Food and drink service by the pool during our stay was excellent. Happy Hour from 3-5 was one of our favorite things - $5 Mai tais and drink specials as well as appetizer specials. As with anywhere, the level of service is probably impacted by how friendly you are or how well you tip if you have a couple wait staff waiting on 300 people. 4. The Beach is great and very close as is the reef. You can literally see exactly where the reef starts and it is close to the shore. Swimming is better just to the south area of the resort. If you are an idiot and go walking out on to the reef with bare feet you will definitely get hurt. Having said that, the snorkeling is fantastic, especially in the morning. We saw tons of different fish, see turtles, and all sorts of life just a few yards away from the sand. The beach was also not crowded. The resort will set up chairs and umbrellas for you if you want, but we never used this. 5. We did the Royal Lahina Luau which was a nice walk down the beach walk to the Royal Lahaina Resort. There are some bad reviews on this but we found it to be fantastic. Again, if you want a romantic luau with table service this might not be your choice. For a family with kids, it was incredibly good. Hint - buy your tickets on the Royal Lahaina website - you get VIP table and free blender drinks all night and most importantly do not have to wait in line for about the same price as the tour operators will charge. 6. Pizza Paradiso across the street had fantastic pizza, Moose Mcgillicudy's in Lahaina had great breakfast. Very nice dinner and atmosphere at the Hula Grill in Whaler's village. Betty's Beach house in Lahaina has a beautiful sunset on one side, sports bar in te other direction and front row seats to a luau that you can watch for free directly in front of you starting around 7 if you want to (Get a table around 6:15 or 6:30). Ululani's shave ice was our favorite and we tried a few. 7. Road to Hana is not difficult and fun, especially if you explore some of the trails and swim in the waterfalls. Leave early in the day. 8. Haleakala was cool, we didn't do it at sunrise. Waited until 9:30 to leave the resort and avoided the crowds. 9. The coffe at the Aina coffee shop in the resort is exceptional. 10. Duke's restaurant at the hotel is quite good. Make sure you get the hula pie. 11. If you rent form a owner or property manager, you get a slightly different experience than renting as a hotel room through the resort (no daily housekeeping, free towels at the pool or room charging), however, we got garage parking directly under our unit and a huge cost savings as a result.

Everyone from the front desk staff, to the valet, to the bell service, to the concierge, were very friendly and helpful (although housekeeping was a bit inconsistent). But whoever decided to build this resort right where the valley funnels the trade winds down the mountain directly into it should be fired. I'm not talking gentle summer breezes, which would have been welcome, but most days it was so gusty that nothing stayed put--not your beach towels, not your food/drinks, and not even the pool chairs! We spent 12 full days here and it was always windy, which became very annoying, especially when a 5 minute walk down the beach and there was NO wind. We left the resort most nights and went to Lahaina to enjoy the beautiful, calm, warm nights there. We have always travelled to tropical destinations at Spring Break, and this was our first time to Hawaii in the summer. The wind did not blow like that in Honolulu, nor anywhere on the Big Island (we were at Hilo and Kona), nor anywhere else in Maui for that matter (we drove to Hana) When we inquired about it at the resort, we were told \"That's the Trade Winds\". It's too bad there was such bad planning to put a beautiful resort in such a bad spot. Our kids enjoyed the pools, we enjoyed the hot tubs and watching the sun set at night, but we definitely won't return in the summer. Next time we will stay closer to Lahaina where it is hot and the WIND DOESN\"T BLOW. **a note about Duke's Restaurant: if you think you are getting a deal at Happy Hour, you are not. They fill the cups with twice the ice and charge half the price.

We booked the Honua Kai resort through Costco Travel. We had looked at the many reviews in this forum before our trip and were not sure what to expect. I would say that this was one of our best places we have ever stayed. The place is very new and furnished with top notch (Bosch) appliances including Washer/Dryer. The kitchen is fully stocked with all kinds of utensils and cutlery. We got a room on the 10th Floor (topmost) in the Konea tower. Our room was facing the mountain but we also had a partial ocean view. The service was very good and more than met our expectations. The overall atmosphere was very family friendly. Let me tell you a few things that have been highlighted in some other reviews. 1. Yes, the place is a bit windy, but it did not bother us one bit. In fact, it seemed to be a blessing in disguise when you are not in the water. 2. Pool facility - Yes, there are no pools which are deeper than 5 feet. Again, it was the least of our botheration. We and our two kids (9 & 14) had a great time. The pool service was evidently absent, but we never felt the need for it. 3. Restaurants - We went to Dukes just once to have a drink. Being vegetarians, we did not find anything suitable. Again, we ended up going to other restaurants in the Lahaina area and mostly fixed our own meal in the room and had them sitting in the Lanai enjoying the excellent view. We could pick up groceries from the Times Supermarket conveniently located across the road from the resort. 4. Beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c There are a few rocks you need to be careful of. If you need to have a better experience in the beach, we would recommend going to the Kaanapali beach in Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s village which is just 5 minutes away by drive. 5. Gym \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We used the facility and found it more than adequate with a good number of equipment. If we have to pick one negative aspect of the room itself, it will be the bathroom.

SCORE! Picking up a room for $250 a night really made the vacation feel like an amazing value. - lovely grounds - nice room furnishings - no high pressured sales presentations or phoney invitations/gifts - felt safe at all hours on the property - great valets - nice boardwalk to the black rock Just okays - the ocean is good for snorkeling but just okay for younger children. Go to Napali or Kapaula for some GREAT family-friendly beach time where you don't have to be an arm's length away from your weak swimmer. - hotel could add either a towel-rack or shelving in the bathroom for toiletries and provide small stools for families with young children to assist them reaching sinks. - almost time to replace the mattresses.. some nights were good.. others were bad. Dislikes: - windy... it did make some days very difficult to enjoy.. patio furniture was being blown across the grounds but that was an extreme day ... the other days it was still very windy - too windy to read a book, golf, etc. - pool service is horrendous.. if you happen to find someone to order from they don't seem to EVER come back.. waiting an hour is not good customer service. Mgmt needs to address this issue. - would be nice to have a shuttle in to Whaler's village in the evenings so that families enjoying a Luau do not have to ben concerned if they have a drink or two - activity desk seemed a bit clueless and disinterested when approached about events happening in the resort - no planned activities in the resort itself - didn't see anyone checking the chemical levels in the pool - many children were poorly behaved at the pool... running up the waterslides after they had closed and jumping down rocky waterfalls... parents need to take responsibility here though. We did not use the kids club ... ironic as we have ALWAYS used them when we go on vacation so I am trying to figure out why we didn't this time.

The bellboys recommended a grocery store nearby, but we found it pricey. There is a nice grocery store in Lahaina with great food, including fresh seafood, great service and was competitively priced. In addition to Lahaina, there are other attractions nearby including a few beaches north of Kaanapali. There is a Marina and Aquarium about 30 minutes away which serves as a base for several activities and day-trips. The resort's concierge was very helpful in planning our time in Maui. We took a few days trips including the Road to Hanna, deep-sea fishing and a catamaran snorkel trip which included snorkelling with sea turtles. Dining in Lahaina was disappointing in general. Food was not bad, but not great. Menus were boring and a little overpriced. We found inspiration from local ingredients and seafood from the grocery store and enjoyed cooking in our room.

Our friend recommended this hotel after staying here with his family. He loved it and for the most part I would agree. Our 2 bedroom condo was spacious and well appointed with a partial view of the ocean. Since the hotel was not busy we were upgraded from a resort view room. The lanai was the width of the condo and the sliding doors opened up the entire living room. A couple of times we forgot to put the sliding screen in place and birds flew into our condo. One other note is that the A/C will automatically turn off if the patio doors are open. The two rooms were spacious, with both having king sized beds and adjoining bathrooms. One of the rooms was slightly smaller and didn't have a window that opened. The other room had a patio with access to the lanai. The former room's share the same thermostat with the living room so if you had the patio open as mentioned above, that room could get a little hot. The latter room had it's own thermostat control. There are LCD TV's in every room with the usual assortment of channels. Wifi is included with the $25 daily resort fee. There are plenty of pools in the resort and it was not too crowded during our stay. Most of the pools are pretty shallow and well suited for kids. The beach was a short walk from the pools and while small, had nice sand and you could enter the water easily. We snorkeled a few times and did see some fish, no turtles though. A couple of the other places we looked at before picking the HK had steep entries into the water or a rocky beach. As some others have mentioned it was very windy for a good part of our stay and not as warm and sunny as I imagined. After reading some of the reviews on TripAdvisor, maybe that's the norm? There's a restaurant, Duke's, located near the pools. It was convenient with very good food and prices on par with a lot of the other restaurants in the area. The Ahi Poke and Ahi Tuna main course were particularly good.

The Resort looks just like the pictures on the website. Clean, well maintained, polite, courteous staff and valets. Major kudos to Jared, Leo and Jake. These guys were always courteous and helpful.

Beautiful grounds, very family oriented. Not a location for a weekend romance. Families barbecuing, playing in the pools and swimming in the ocean. Families having meals on the large lanai\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and enjoying the sunset. The reviews about the sanitation plant off the highway in near proximity to the Resort are a bit harsh. Only on a couple of occasions did we get a mere whiff of the plant when the wind shifted. This did not detract from our enjoying the grounds. We had a mountain view, one bedroom for ourselves and two teenage daughters. The sanitation plant was in plain site but was not obstructing our view or overbearing. It was on the other side of the highway and you really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice it (really - it wasn't that significant). Suggest stopping off at the Safeway (bring your Von\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Club Card\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthings are expensive) on the way in to Lahani.

We also took out trash and made the sofabed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c remember it is a condo resort not a full service hotel. Did purchase supplies of toilet paper and papertowels.

We were very impressed by the grounds and the quality of the rooms. I will preface this review by stating that we booked with Harris Hawaii and were able to pick the specific room we were staying in. I highly suggest this option. We knew exactly what our view would be before we left the mainland and that was reassuring to say the least. There are some units in this complex I would personally not want to stay in. Some of the Mountain view rooms look directly across the street at the sewage treatment facility. While it did not bother us at all, I would not want to pay to look at/smell that for my entire vacation. As other reviews have stated the Honua Kai does not have the biggest beach in the world. My wife and I were very happy with it though. It didn't get nearly as busy as the other beaches around the rest of the island, which is what we were looking for. There are plenty of places were you can wade in and out of the water without encountering many rocks. We were very happy with the foliage that hangs over the very edge of the beach. It gave us a great way to get out of the shade without having to rent an umbrella. We also stocked a cooler and took our own beverages to the beach. I didn't see anyone serving drinks on the beach so this was perfect for us. You are not allowed to have a cooler by the pool as Duke's restaurant is responsible for serving drinks. Seemed like service was pretty slow, but I'll admit we did not use any server. The location of the resort is great. Right in between Lahaina and Kapalua. We spent nights in both places and it was not more than a 10 minute drive either way. This does seem to be one of windiest parts of the island, but it was actually quite refreshing to us and didn't cause much inconvenience. It was very nice to have the kitchen amenities in the condo. We were able to do breakfast and lunch in almost every day and saved us a ton of money on food. We were also able to buy 90% of our beverages(adult and kid friendly) from the grocery store. It was great to have a full size refrigerator to keep drinks cold and make ice when needed. The times grocery store is just outside of the complex and was fine for picking up what you needed. We saw nicer stores on the island, but this was close and the prices seemed to be fair. If you were staying for longer than a week you might want to stop at Costco by the airport. We will probably do this next trip. Overall this was a great place to stay and we will be back. I think this resort can really be what you make it. My wife and I were looking for a place to relax and keep to ourselves and try not the blow our budget on drinks and food. This is a great place for that. However if you choose to eat out every meal and order your drinks Duke's is a great place to do it. We ate there twice and were very impressed by the food. The Mai Tai was not the greatest though.

We were able to get a 3 bedroom condo, full ocean view for about $688.00 per night (with taxes and cleaning fees included, on a 4 night stay). This was a comparable price to what we paid at the Maui Sheraton for a one bedroom \"villa\" with no kitchen or private bedrooms. This was our first trip to Maui and we split up our stay with three different types of accommodations. We did enjoy our stay at Honua Kai, and would probably go back--for a portion of our trip--simply for the value it presented. Some observations: The beach in front of Honua Kai is not great at all. Lots and lots of coral. My kids couldn't even walk out in it to body surf. It is probably a 15 minute walk to Airport Beach which is probably where we'd hang out if we went back. The atmosphere is very sterile. My husband commented that it had a \"Stepford Wives\" feel to it. For instance, on every lanai is the exact same furniture and, if you look, you will see that everything in every condo is exactly the same, right down to the coffee cups! It's a small complaint but the place seemed to seriously lack personality. Perhaps the immature landscaping contributed to that feel. We liked Duke's, but it's very expensive and, after 2 nights, we felt like we'd \"been there, done that\" with the menu. There aren't a lot of other close restaurants around, nothing like the area closer to Whaler's Village. The gourmet market was handy but also extremely expensive. Having said all that, my family REALLY enjoyed the roominess, the luxurious feel of the condo, the pool area, and especially that wonderful lanai where we spent some great family time.

Pros: Condo layout and value for money was excellent - we got a two bedroom for the price of one at the Westin, very nicely decorated inside, lots of storage for clothing, nicely laid out features Grounds are lovely and very well maintained Dukes right on the beach is a great amenity, although it would be nice if they had more variety in their barefoot menu - lovely atmosphere here with music etc.. Snorkelling, despite the coral, was not as good as outside the Westin or at Black rock, but was still pretty good Right opposite there is a small strip mall with Times supermarket, close to an ABC store, in resort Aina store had nice quality local organic produce Cons: I did smell the sewage plant often, although it wasn't strong it did bother me, seemed to be worse in the Hokulani Tower area It was very windy during our stay - it did seem windy at Black Rock too, but both the wind and the rain (occasional) did seem to be notieceably worse at the HK than even a little further south at the Westin I missed the shuttle bus which the Westin has - because of the wind we ended up going somewhere in the car pretty much everyday and it would have been nice to get a shuttle into Whalers or Lahaina I personally found the HK lacking in atmosphere The beach right outside the condo has coral right up to the entry - you really need to go south a couple of hundred yards to get in and out with safety and dignity! I thought the $25 day resort fee was a bit of a con for wifi (I get this free in the park at home, who charges for that nowadays?), parking, and the gym Overall, this had much more of a feel of a fully owned condo resort - many of the units were empty since they were either not sold or the owners were not renting out when they weren't there. No Spa yet, no activities like Movies etc.. No fire pit for smores (they should add that), but the usual BBQs etc. Pools were nice but I thought nothing special. There is no 'lazy river' as such, just a river shaped pool in an arc, no flowing water. Poolside chaises were a little hard if you sat very long in them. There were lots of umbrellas for shade (many were broken probably due to the wind but still many available). Poolside service from Dukes was barely present, you really had to go out of your way to get attention from the limited serving staff. Although the condos are pretty new, we saw quite a bit of wear and tear that would concern me if I was considering buying. Some of the fixtures (dishwasher, faucets) were already aging suggesting the quality wasn't really up to the job. The lanai with the fold away windows was a great idea but we were not able to use at all because of the wind.

Where to begin? Let's start with the structure: Honua Kai is a well designed property. Even with a suite in the back half of a building facing away from the beach, I could still sit and easily see the ocean from my lanai. And to the left was the West Maui mountains and frequent rainbows. It's win-win. The rooms are soundproof and it felt like we were the only ones on our floor. The property is laid out open and spacious to the beach. Unlike the Westin Villas to the south, the HK did not build structures to the property edge and squeeze the common areas. Instead, it has expansive pool and garden areas with wide open vistas. Lounges are not sandwiched side to side, lined rows deep, but are comfortably spaced throughout the grounds - which feels more like luxury, less like a stockade. When the gardens mature, it'll be quite lush. Speaking of luxury, the HK provides it at realistic, post recession prices. A spacious pool gazebo offering sun and wind protection and cushiony soft lounges is $25 for an afternoon. Attendants will take your drink and food order from Dukes, or let you set up your own drinks and food. Dukes was excellent. Delicious food, varied menu, and you can't beat $5 happy hour mai tais and small plates with live music beachside. The pools themselves are large, fun and lovely. There is no adult-only pool, but most of the kids are attracted to the slide pool. The \"river\" pool doesn't have an actual current, but it is fun. There are several spas, and also wading pools for the little ones. The beach out front isn't an outstanding swimming beach, but it is servicable. The best entry is to the south; avoid the north, especially in front of the Mahana (and water socks area always a good idea in the ocean). But if you are snorkelers like us, the water is clear and the snorkeling is decent, so it worked better for us than a sandy bottom. We had a one bedroom suite, which was spacious enough for our family of 2 adults and 2 teen boys. The storage was great - I especially liked the laundry room which allowed us to sash our snorkeling gear and boogie boards out of sight. And as much as I hate doing laundry, it was super convenient to have a washer and dryer. The california king bed was easy to sleep in. We reserved from Quam properties via VRBO. We did not pay the daily resort fee, but still had access to the workout facilities (which we didn't use, preferring a morning jog on the beach path). Quam was great, charges no cleaning fee for stays of 7 days and the prices reasonable. Of the two towers, the Hokulani tower has the Aina market and is a bit closer to the ocean. We stayed in the Konea tower, which is newer. The underground parking is close and accessing your car quick and easy. This trip we visited both the Grand Wailea and the Westin Villas and - unless you need an onsite spa and multiple restaurants (and some do) - felt like neither of those properties had anything over the HK.

The combination of excellent reviews regarding the facility and the savings we foresaw in a 3-BR Condo lay-out versus 3 adjoining hotel rooms (6 adult family vacation) lead us to book here. Observations: Pluses: - 3 BR ocean-view Condo suite was clean & accommodated our needs. The Lani porch was large with table, chairs, and lounges. We used the grill twice to cook local fish. The sunsets were gorgeous. Both the kitchen and bathrooms were high end and clean. - Hotel wifi worked well and was included in resort fee. - Valet parking was prompt and courteous. - The two buildings serve multiple pools and beach. The guests were predominantly families but well behaved children & remarkably not crowded. Easy to always find available lounge chairs at the pool. - Boardwalk runs along beach for quite a distance and is great for both walking and jogging -\"Times\" grocery mart in strip center across from facility and great for food shopping - Great snorkeling right in front of facility b/c of coral & can body-surf short walk up beach Minuses: - One building had 2 room Exercise facility / other one room. Neither had good ventilation and felt like \"after-thoughts.\" - Concierge service generally good for finding activities and sea-side dinners. But one lady quipped to my daughter & her friend, as they came off the beach and inquired about a Spa Pedicure: \"We have no spa, their is one at the Westin next-door. but are you sure that it is in your budget or do you just want to get your nails done at the strip center across the street?\" (not very professional.) Oh, they don't have spa despite it being in their name. - Dukes restaurant is good and they have a market with quick groceries and coffee. Another eating option on-site would have been nice. In general, the facility was beautiful and relaxing; but realize this is more of a luxury condo facility then a high-end hotel. This met our needs as our family could congregate and enjoy our time better than if we were in separate hotel rooms. Also: would definitely rent a car; check out the Hula Grill in Whaler's Village for sunset meal; and get Opah (local fish) somewhere as it is the best light, flakey local fish I have tasted!

We rented a 2 bedroom condo (#745 Hokulani Tower) for our family of 5 (three kids 12 and under) through Harris Hawaii and we very pleased with what we experienced. After confirming by phone when our plane was due in, the property manager Brooke met us about 10:30 pm and showed us around our clean and well appointed place, and we were able to call him or his associate any time we had any questions or ran out of anything that they keep stocked. The condo came with towels for inside and a beach towel for each person which can be washed as often as needed in the washer/dryer unit. There were some beach toys and chairs that we were able to use as well. It was stocked with shampoo, hand, dish, dishwasher and laundry soap. The beds can be two kings or four twins with a queen hide-a-bed in the living room. There is a small charge for making the beds into twins, and making up the hide-a-bed, and a cleaning fee at the end (altogether $250 I think), which makes up for the fact that you don't pay the $25/day resort fee. We liked not having the maid service each day, but if you like that sort of thing then stay in the hotel, not a condo. There is the option of having a mid-stay clean for an additional charge which we did not do. We got a reduced rate since it was not high season and it was short notice. The place had three big flat screen tvs (one per room) which is either great or terrible depending on how you look at it. There is free wi-fi that we could use in the room, and possibly outside the room, not sure, and a phone to use as well, at no charge. We enjoyed the pool and green space below our tower and also the series of pools in front of the neighboring tower. We used the BBQ in front of our tower and there were tools in the stove drawer which I found afterward. Noticed the other tower's BBQs less busy. We used the services of the activity advisor which saved us money in one case and cost us just a little more than booking direct in another. The only irritating thing about the condo itself was that the dishwasher beeps until you turn it off when it is done and so putting it on before heading to bed was a a pain until I discovered the delayed start. We did not rent a car, but I think there would have been a $10 fee for parking per night. There is a grocery store across the street (5-8 min. walk). and a 40-45 minute brisk walk takes you to Whaler's Village shopping area. There is also a little resort shuttle that you can catch 2-3 hotels down the beach and a Maui bus you can catch ($1 per ride or $2 for the whole day if you ask for it) at the hotel next door (5-8 min walk) that will take you to Whaler's Village, Lahaina and beyond or the opposite direction. The view from our room facing the courtyard was great, and being able to snorkel right down at the beach in front of our place was great too.

We traveled with a 11 and a 13 year old, and they like to play in the water - it can be slippery, obviously, and the side of the pool is decorated with stones, so our younger one had a head injury.

I didn't know this is not where most of the hotels in Kaanapali are located. It's actually in North Kaanapali. I found out after the fact that North Kaanapali is a lot more windy. My husband and I booked a one-bedroom with the mountain view. The mountain view from our room was beautiful. The sliding doors in the living room and the bedroom can be opened all the way. I was hoping to sit out in our lanai. However, it was just way too windy outside. Also the lanais are all connected. So people could walk by your lanai and your room. I was also hoping to sit in the lobby or by the pool area. Again, it was too windy to do that. Everyday my husband and I dreaded going in and out of our car to get in and out of the resort because it would be like the windy city of Chicago. By the 5th night we were there, I wanted to leave and move to a hotel in the main Kaanapali area. But given that we only had two nights left in Maui, we decided to stay. I mean, the room was nice. We liked the full kitchen. I didn't have to buy bottled water because the fridge came with filtered water. We also did our laundry as our room came with a washer and dryer. We also enjoyed free internet in the room. We didn't mind paying the $25 resort fee. I think most of the hotels in Maui do that. We had to pay resort fees in Palm Springs before, so it wasn't a shocker for us to pay the fee here. To avoid waiting for our car in the wind too long, we would call the valet from our room to have them pull our car up when we were ready to leave the resort. Anyway, to me, the wind really bothered me. Next time I would stay at one of those hotels in Kaanapali south of Black Rock where it is less windy. In terms of housekeeping, well, they were not that consistent. For the first two days we didn't have a liner to our shower curtain. We thought that's the kind of shower curtain the resort used. So for two days our bathroom smelled mildewy. We finally called housekeeping and found out we were missing the liner. We were also missing a light bulb for the wall lamp next to the dining table. For the first few days we thought the wall lamp was just a decoration. We finally figured out it was a real lamp but just missing a light bulb. On some of the days we would not get a new bottle of body lotion, and then on some of the days we would get a whole bunch of towels. And on the last day we were out of toilet paper because the day before they did not give us a new roll of toilet paper. But they did throw our dishes we left in the sink (meaning to wash them later) to the dishwasher and had them washed, even though there were only a couple of cups and a knife or a spoon. We felt bad wasting all that power and water for a few dishes, so a couple of times we just washed them ourselves before housekeeping came. The valet guys were very nice and helpful. They gave us a few tips on where we should go. The resort only had one concierge person. Every time I went over there the concierge was with somebody, so I never bothered to get info there. There was a little convenience store in the lobby, but the prices were not cheap. So we would drive to Safeway near Lahaina to buy groceries. Before we left, we found out there was another supermarket further north that we could have gone. Duke was right next to the resort, but the food was over-rated. I would just get my cocktail there. For food, just drive to Lahaina, which is only 10-15 minutes away. Or just drive 3 minutes north to Okazuya & Deli Honokowai. We found out the chef there used to be a chef at Mama's Kitchen. The food was soooo good and inexpensive. Overall we do like the resort.

The resort was beautiful. We were initially in a one bedroom mountain view room . We arrived late at night so I did not get the full effect of the room until the next morning and I was not happy with the road noise that one would hear if the patio doors were open or if one wanted to sit on the balcony (which was huge) which I really enjoy doing. I asked to be switched to something quiter and we were moved to the other building (Konoa) and given a room that was still a mountain view but faced the other building and not directly onto the road. This was a vast improvement. The noise was greatly diminished, we no longer looked out over the parking lot and still had beautiful mountain views. The new room also had a den which the previous room did not, and with two teenage girls, the additional space was wonderful. The room was great. Huge bathroom, 3 flat screen TV's, super comfy beds. We loved it. We found all the employees at the resort and at Duke's to be very friendly and helpful. We had no complaints. A few minor negatives: My god was it windy!!! I read about this in a few reviews but not many so perhaps it is something that just comes and goes. I would say that 5 out of the 7 days we were there, it was windy to the point of it being comical. On the other hand, it didn't rain at all while we were there, so I guess that is a pretty good trade-off. Pool areas were beautiful, very lush and tropical. Only complaint was that the pool chairs/lounges were very uncomfortable. They looked great, but extended seating (even with frequent shifting around) was painful. It might be worthwile if something like this is an issue for you to rent one of the 2-person cabanas ($25.00) per day or for only $15.00 more a large cabana. The beach was fine with good snorkling only about 20 feet out. Beach was never crowded although it would have been nice to be able to rent beach cabanas like one can at other beach resorts, but again, this is a very minor complaint. Ate at Duke's and for the most part it was good, but prices were the usual for eating out in Hawaii- expensive. Housekeeping was hit or miss for the most part and I feel that the $25.00 resort fee is a bit ridiculous, it seems like they are charging for things that should come with the room anyway.

We arrived late at night and they were expecting us. The valet/bellman (Randy, I believe) was excellent. The check-in went smoothly. Our room was very nice. We had a two-bedroom/ocean view. The first thing we noticed is the fantastic lanai. It was a huge wrap-around with wonderful views of the courtyard and ocean. The room was well laid out, but you can tell that it is starting to get a little worn around the edges. Nothing major, just little things like frayed carpet, hinged door missing from the thermostat, a crack in a fridge compartment. Otherwise, the room was very nice and functional. The resort grounds are lush and gorgeous, as are most of the beachfront resorts in Maui. The trees, shrubs, flowers, koi ponds all add to the relaxing atmosphere...which is partially negated by many, many small children. We have older teens so we have definitely been there, done that with small kids. I was just surprised at how many kids there were as a percentage of resort guests. We were never bothered to the point of being annoyed. Just something to be aware of. If you are expecting a quiet, relaxing outdoor environment, free of small children, you should probably look elsewhere. The resort has three separate pool areas. If I were them, I would really try to designate or at least encourage parents to use the two pools that are obviously tailored to children. Leave the pool at the southern end of the property for 18+ yrs. I don't know how workable that would be, but I think it would help offer a more peaceful atmosphere. The beach here is lovely and a photographers dream. It is also relatively uncrowded. This could be partially due to the fact that as you wade into the water, you will find it to be objectionable to the feet. Very rocky bottom. If you want a sandy bottom, you should stay to the south of Black Rock. But the snokeling was somewhat better here (although if you want GREAT snorkeling drive about 15 minutes north to Honolua Bay). We had several great dining experiences at Duke's, the beachside restaurant on the resort property. It was expensive, but in line with other Maui restaurants of it's caliber. The food and service were always consistent and good. We especially enjoyed their breakfast and dinner. (See Duke's review). One of my biggest gripes with Honua Kai was their lack of a business center or anything resembling one. On one of my excursions, I was asked to bring a copy of my confirmed reservation. When I went downstairs to do this, the front desk person told me that they have no way of providing this for their guests. No room, no printer, no nothing. When I asked how I was supposed to print out this confirmation (or boarding passes for that matter), I was met with an \"I'm not sure\". They couldn't even tell me where I could find a nearby facility to accomplish this very simple task. So I had to go find a printing place on my own (in the shopping center just north of the property). A resort of this caliber should have this type of very basic service available to their guests. The staff ranged from very friendly to indifferent. I got more good information from the valet and bellmen than from the front desk or concierge. Also, the activities center by the pool was better than most resorts. Although you are gouged for their services, like every other resort, they at least treat you well and give you good information. And they don't hassle you to buy everything they are hawking. The little store downstairs was nice, but only to be used if you need something right away as their prices are much higher than what you can get from a nearby store. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay at the Honua Kai and it is a beautiful resort. If they dealt with the few minor issues I mentioned, they could really improve their offering.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver, co", "Title": "\u201cNice Place-What You Need to Know\u201d", "Author": "Traveler1Denver_Co", "ReviewID": "UR114876649", "Content": "We spent 10 days here and there are some things to know that are very helpful. 1.) If you are staying in a condo on the road side (not the sea or pool view) your balcony is not useable. The wind precludes any activity so it is lost space. 2.) No need to go to CostCo or KMart for food upon leaving the airport. There is a wonderful super market just across the parking lot. It has everythng you need at about the same price. 3.) Virtually none of the umbrella stands at the pool are in working order. The constant wind ruined all of them (and they were cheap stuff to begin with). 4.) Be prepared for almost constant wind and don't let it ruin your fun. 5.) There is a fabulous walkway that runs along the beach from the Honua Kai to Whalers Village. It is about an hour walk that is beautiful and easy. You have to wind around some of the hotels but you will find your way. 6.) If you are going to pay for a snorkeling cruise (and you should go to Molokini) then look to the QuickSilver Maui. The crew is just fantastic and will take care of your every need. The lunch on board was unbelievable. There are a lot of boats at Molokini but it does not diminish your fun. No need to take a small boat as the QuickSilver is just right. 7.) If you want truly great snorkeling head the other direction from the Honua Kai. Go toward the other end of the island not toward Whaler's Village. Take the road about 15 minutes until in narrows down to a winding road in the jungle. About 15 minutes from the Honau Kai you will come to the bottom of a hill, a narrow one lane bridge, and a bunch of cars parked. The bay is visible when you make the turn to go down the hill. Walk through the jungle on the well worn paths to the rocky beach. There is no sand so this is a snorkeling spot only. The water is clear and beautiful. Head out to the reef and go to each side of the bay. Note. Do not even pause when the squatters at the water's edge give you the scam that they are care takers of the beach. It is only a scam. It is public property. Don't stop to listen to their scam just walk on by. 8.) Spend the time to go all the way to the end of the road at the other side of the island. It is about a 45 minute drive but you will find incredible surf and crystal clear beaches. Just head back toward the airport but don't make the turn just stay along the water. You will pass all of the big name resorts. Keep going until it becomes rural and remote and you will find the locals. 9.) Expect little from the hotel staff as they are simply not trained to be great hosts. You don't need them. The coffee shop is fine but they keep banker's hours so if you want coffee early don't rely on them. 10.) Get out and away from the condo. The coffee plantation across the street is free and has some incredible views.

We searched online for hotels in Maui. We had never been there before so we were unsure what area to book our hotel. We chose the Honua Kai when we saw the websites and previous reviews. When we first arrived, it was awesome. I actually told my husband that this trip has been great so far and he said, dont say that yet bc we havent seen our room! When our valet took us to our room, we were pleasantly surprised. It was awesome. So big, and clean! Our room had a King bed with a down mattress pad and a down compforter with sheets on each side. I am really a germaphobe and hotel bedding really grosses me out so this was great. Also, the bedding smelled so clean like home, Normally hotel linens smell like chemicals. We also had a sofa bed and chair, full kitchen with full fridge, and dishwasher, bathroom with stand up shower and bathtub and washer and dryer. Our sliding glass doors went out to a lanai that overlooked the ocean with a table and chairs. The door also opened up to become all screens for an awesome breeze. The pool and beach in front of the hotel were great. All of the staff were nice. There is a nice boardwalk area for walking up and down the beaches. I believe it stretches a few miles. The restaurant, \"Dukes\", was really great. We ate there 2 times and had drinks there because it was right on the beach and at the pool. It was open air and a lot of fun. We also used the gym everyday and although small, it was very sufficient with treadmills, elliptical, free weights and weight systems like the total body gym. I dont know if this is for everyone, but our services included a $25 a day resort fee. That included towel rental, free valet, free valet service to carry luggage, groceries to your room, gym fee and internet. I thought that was more than fair. We never had a problem with any of the services. I just cannot explain how awesome this hotel was to the full extent. We are planning our next trip back soon. It was so convienant to everything. We ere able to go to the grocery store to get food for our room which saved a lot of money. The laundry facilities were also very nice since we were there 2 weeks and would have ran out of clothes. This is the nicest hotel I have stayed in and I have traveled a lot, internationally also. Not in regards to being a fancy hotel, but a well decorated, hospitable, clean hotel with all of the amenities I needed.

And I want to be very fair. So I will note that there was much to like about what Honua Kai had to offer, but it was their poor customer service which will make me determined to never return and be sure to visit any of the MANY other neighboring resorts. Honua Kai is a beautiful resort, steps away from the beach and situated in Lahaina close to various shopping and dining. I enjoyed that the room had 1 bedroom and a separate living and dining area, a full size kitchen with every comfort of home (coffee machine, dishwasher, deep basin sinks, microwave, stove, oven, full size friedge), plus the convenience of an in unit washer and dryer. It was nicely laid out, the furniture was comfortable and well taken care of. The balcony was large and you were able to completely open the doors to join your indoor and outdoor living space together. The resort itself was beautifully situated, along with it's neighboring resorts. The pools were great, enjoyable for couples and families. The gym that I went to was small and humid but the machines were nice. Not the best gym I've used at a resort, but workable. They did say there was another gym on location that had more machines. The pool towels were rough and quite worn, definitely needs to be replaced. We did not take advanatage of their \"discounted\" rentals (such as snorkel sets, etc.) - for that we went elsewhere. Duke's Beach House, the restaurant at the resort was not that great. Service was - okay, and the food wasn't really worth the price. The view was great - but again, I have no doubt that the other neighboring resort restaurants had equally beautiful views. Aina Gourmet had some decent and interesting offerings, but was definitely overpriced. If anything the overpriced restaurants made us take advantage of local mom and pop restaurants as well as a trip to grocery store and farmer's market. At the end, what was incredibly unreasonable, was their Resort Fee. Now I'll be honest, this IS the first time I've ever had a hotel charge a resort fee - and certainly the first time that a hotel did not disclose what there would be charges for ahead of time. And we've stayed at many different hotels, from Vegas to Tokyo to Hong Kong to Costa Rica and LA. First time ever - charged a resort fee - first time ever that no costs were disclosed upon checking in. That's ridiculous. It was $25/day plus tax of course. Now when I book a hotel, I really don't think it's much to expect that what I pay for includes certain things - period. We did not valet our car either folks. They claimed that the $25/day was for: - Self-parking - Room cleaning (such as refreshing of towels, replenishing toiletries, etc - everything that every other normal hotel includes in their price) which btw we only had our room cleaned twice since I like to be conservative of towel use, etc. (you know, because it's beaten into you about how a resort prides themselves in their \"Sustainability\" efforts) - Pool Towels - which we only used twice, AND if you didn't return a towel, it was a $25 charge per un-returned towel. - Their \"discounted\" rates on renting equipment such as fins, masks, snorkels, etc. Which we did not take \"advanatge\" of. In fact their rates are no different then any other resort, and definitely not as good as a place like Boss Frog's (fabulous establishment btw, go there to rent your snorkel sets and book a helicopter ride with Air Maui!). - Their wi-fi - which we also did not use. - And whatever else they wanted to throw in there to make it seem like worth $25/day. And really, was anything listed that you wouldn't have expected to be included in the price you already paid? What leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is how they slipped us this bill at the end with no disclosure in the beginning. If they said all those things from the getgo - believe me, I would have said \"Great, how much is self-parking - because everything else, we don't need.\" And all they could say was well - we have a Resort Fee, everyone has Resort Fees. Really, that's the way you handle this sort of situation? Disappointing - I expected something better. First time there, never to go back - they did not resolve the matter to my satisfaction. I would much rather stay at the Westin next door - same views, same beaches, or the Ritz Carlton just a little bit north. It certainly would have come to about the same price.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Oswego, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent place to relax with the family in style and comfort.\u201d", "Author": "Johntravels61", "ReviewID": "UR114686203", "Content": "The perfect set up.

In planning this trip I researched the Honua Kai but decided to instead stay at the Kapalua Resort for a change of pace. We figured it was summer and there would be better weather. Before we headed to Kapalua we stayed 3 nights at the Hyatt Regency in Maui. There was a large group of us and we had two rooms. First I have to say that stay was wonderful. The staff was incredible and the grounds were WOW. This was my sister's first visit to Hawaii and she really enjoyed herself. I think the one disappointment I had was the pool area for my 7 year old son. I wish there was more 3 ft. section for him to frolic in....there was a small amount but it was in the grotto. Once some of the family left we moved to Kapalua. Wanted to have a condo. I did extensive research on this trip. Since Outrigger could not guarantee me where my \"partial\" ocean vew would be (bay, golf or ridge) I decided to book a particular condo through an outside rental company. This turned out to be a HUGE mistake for us. Not that there was anything wrong with the condo...except the fact that it smelled really musty and moldy to me and had been locked up for a few weeks not rented. It really bothered my allergies. I contacted the rental company and they quickly moved me to another unit (and charged me more because it had a better view). The ac unit tooks HOURS to even get the unit to 75 and we had to leave for 5 hours since it was so hot. We spent the night and this place also smelled musty and moldy. I got no sleep and my eye, nose and ears were itching like someone had rubbed a cat in my face. Granted.. I am very sensitive but in all our travels I have never experienced this before. I have to admit the rental company (although rudely) agreed to refund our money and gave us till that afternoon to find another accommodation. I contacted Outrigger but they were sold out of units there at Kapalua. We then got in the car and drove down to Honua Kai. I based this visit on the fact that it was rated so highly on Tripadvisor (thank goodness i had my laptop!!). The front desk staff was so incredible in assisting us to find a room and provide us with a great rate. They even walked us to a few of their mountain view rooms to check them out. I remember reading reviews about a :sewage smell\" but I can promise you we never had any issues AND we slept with our doors open all night. While we missed giving up our ocean view room...the stay was incredible. I have to agree that it did not compare to \"resort grounds\" like those down in Kaanapali in the older hotels. But the grounds were still incredible. Our 7 year old loved looking for frogs at night! They were wonderful at the Kid's program that they have in the evenings and you only pay per hour!! No need to lock into a full night. We loved the room. We had a one bedroom with a den. If you can grab one of those, it is nice, especially with kids. My husband and I could sit in the living room and my son had his own space to play and his own TV too! I loved the pools. Better than the Hyatt, Westin or Marriott....at least for our family. It is not a massive pool like the Hyatt, but had lots of chairs and sections for both families and kids. Nice areas for cooking out also. I agree it is not a great \"swimming beach\"...but our son played in the waves and my husband snorkeled right offshore! We have visited most all the islands and stayed in a number of resorts. These 4 days were really nice. It was so easy to park and walk to your room...in contrast to other properties where self parking is a nightmare.

Beautiful living area with flat screen TV, washer and dryer, upscale kitchen with beautiful appliances. The bathrooms are also stunning with soaking tubs in each bath, granite countertops and a spacious separate shower. We had 4 in our party and felt like we all had so much space and privacy. The lanai had a huge table where we enjoyed breakfast each morning before venturing out to the pools and beaches. Each bedroom also has a flat screen TV. Duke's restaurant is on site and the food quality was some of the best on the island. We also loved lounging and relaxing at the pools daily and took advantage of the food and drink service poolside. Locaton is perfect, close to both Kaanapili Beach and Kapalua in Maui. Downtown Lahaina is also not very far away. There is an additional $25/day resort fee here which includes the valet and wi-fi which worked perfectly. Honua Kai also has a great maid service, our room was always tidy and fresh when we returned in the evening. The beach in back of Honua Kai is gorgeous, a nice stretch of sand for walking or jogging and close to Duke's. We snorkeled there the first day and saw some fish and alot of pretty kelp. The sunset when we renewed our vows was also gorgeous at this beach. We are already planning a return trip with our entire family for Dec. of 2012. Honua Kai met all of our needs and we cannot wait to return again next visit to Maui.:)", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cAWESOME!!!!\u201d", "Author": "jfulls84", "ReviewID": "UR113462057", "Content": "We stayed here for our honeymoon and had an incredible stay!

After our experience at the property in 2010, we decided to book another stay for 2011. We stayed in a 3-bedroom direct-ocean-view unit that is managed by the onsite \"hotel\" service for part of our trip; then moved to a studio, partial-ocean-view unit, rented directly from an owner. Both experiences were positive and we plan to return next year. Find owners at VRBO.com. If ocean views are important to you, book a 3-bedroom unit ending in 25 or 29, or a studio unit ending in 23 or 31. Second floor units share a common lanai area, but the views are partially blocked by the solid railing around the perimeter of the large deck. There are larger ocean-front 3-bedroom specialty units with great ocean views from the living area and lanai, but the bedrooms are side-facing (into the property). There are some 2-bedroom units with direct ocean views from within the unit, although many only have ocean views from their lanais and none from the bedrooms. All one-bedroom units have property or mountain views. Renting directly from an owner may be the best way to guarantee the view from a particular unit. There are undeveloped construction sites next to the property and some units face these areas. The hotel does not guarantee the availability of a particular unit and will not tell you which unit is yours until you arrive at the front desk for check-in. There are two towers at the property: Hokulani and Konea. Hokulani is the first tower accessible from the highway and has a small gourmet market in the lobby. The fitness center for the property is located in the second tower, Konea. The Spa, to be located in Konea, is not open yet, with no announced service provider. If you are looking for one of the best spas in Maui that is near Honua Kai, drive north on Highway 30 for about 10 minutes to the Kapalua Spa. There is also a pricier spa at the Ritz Carlton Kapalua. If you do not want to drive to a spa, walk down the boardwalk to the closest spa at the Westin's Spa Helani. If hotel-like maid service is important to you, book through Honua Kai. We thought the maid service was adequate with light daily cleaning, bed-making and fresh towels, but did not miss the service when we moved to a unit without maid service. Coffee addicts, it's BYOC after the initial welcome packet is used. The bell/valet service was excellent. During our check-in, our bags were delivered to our unit before we made it up the elevator. Each time we phoned ahead for our car, it was ready when we arrived at the front entry. The bell service was prompt, even during the busy check-out time. Underground self-parking is convenient and available for a lower daily fee. Honua Kai-managed units have traditional hotel-like telephones with single buttons for each type of service. Individually-owned units may have regular phones with no service buttons. The owner-operated studio unit we occupied had free wireless internet access. Both units had great flat-screen TVs with Blue-ray DVD players (DVDs can be rented at The Times market across the highway for $1+tax). The 3-bedroom unit had an iPod (not iPhone) docking station that could play music through individual controllers and speakers in every room, including the bathrooms. Although the 3-bedroom unit had high-end kitchen appliances like a Viking refrigerator and two Wolf convection ovens, we preferred the Bosch appliances in the studio unit. The Bosch refrigerator included a water dispenser that we found useful. The stacked washer/dryer units were adequate for light loads but had about 2-hour dry times. Be prepared for children. This is a popular spot for families. Be prepared for pets. Unfortunately, the developer chose to sell the units as pet-friendly. We watched as one pet owner repeatedly allowed his dog to use the lawn in the courtyard of Hokulani tower. This is sad because we also watched many children at play in the same area. Pet owners could do themselves a favor and keep the interior courtyard free from pet waste and yellow-spotted grass. There are many other areas on the property that are accessible for pets, but not frequently used by people. Shade-seekers can rent Gazebos at the pool from the Maui Activities center located behind Duke's restaurant. Unlike the regular pool deck chairs, the Gazebos include comfortable cushions. The pools on the property are well kept and offer a variety of types of fun, including a small water slide in front of Konea. There is no \"Adult-only\" pool.

Great washer and dryer in room that I definitely used after staying in Hawaii for 8 days, it was nice to be able to go home with clean laundry! The hotel also hooked us up with a beautiful ocean view, we paid for side-ocean and really it was more like full ocean view from the nice balcony on one of the top floors. This is a new resort, and while it is very nice, there are a few things I would improve on in the room. #1 and this one is huge for me is Replace the Shower head so more than a trickle of water comes out. I'm a skinny girl, 110 lb. and the water only hit one arm at a time, and I have long hair too so you can imagine how long it took me to shower and feel clean after wearing sunscreen all day and swimming in pools and the ocean. #2 is add a full length mirror somewhere in the room. ONly mirror is in the bathroom. REsort was very clean, very nice staff, they put away our groceries in the fridge before we even walked into the room since we had to wait 30 min before we could check-in. Not a big deal bc the staff was really accomodating. The snorkel equipment was overpriced here, $15/day so if you want to snorkel i would suggest driving down the road a little and renting equipment from a local place for $15 for the week!

My wife did notice that the baseboards were not totally clean in the room but whatever. Location was great, theres a boardwalk that links up all the resorts and shopping right across the street. Overall Staff were great except one (see the bad) Check in check out was great, along with the Bell service. They helped out with bringing up groceries and were always available. Valet parking was all included but we optioned just to park our car ourselves, i dont know, i just felt more comfortable just personal i guess. We had a 2 year old that required a nap and our flight wasnt until that evening so they let us have a late check out which was great. The Bad We initally booked a resort view room and basically we had a typoon constantly running throught the room along with the noisy highway traffic. I finally had enough and they ended up moving us to the next building with a particial oceanview which was just wonderful. No typoons and no highway noise. The moral of the story dont book resort view overlooking the highway. Pay the extra money you wont regret it. One employee (i forget her name, older Hawaiian Lady) was very diffciult, short and not made for customer service. Sorry but they should give her a new title with no contact with customers. Both my wife and i noticed a few occasions that she was rude with us and other customers. I did mention this some other staff and they agreed they heard that before. The moral of the story, beware of the older Hawaiian lady at the front counter of the main building. The grounds are beautiful but theres was always a smell of sewer that would show up at random times. Theres a sewage treatment plant accross the highway but i think there more to it. They resuse the grey water on the resort and it has some sort of system in place that manages this. I think this is where the smell around the pool areas was coming from.

They also provided us with welcome champagne and two souvenir champagne flutes. The room was clean and soundproof, the furnishings were new, tasteful, and luxurious, and the in-unit washer dryer were useful. We were provided with dish soap and enough for two loads of laundry. All the basic utensils, plates, etc, were provided, and there was a large flat screen TV in every room. In Hawaii, it's hard to get value for your buck, but we definitely felt like we got our money's worth and more here. One caveat- the rooms can be very luck of the draw in terms of view- some partial ocean view rooms have great views like ours did (we were on the south building facing north), whereas others have very poor views. If view is important to you, the vrbo's might be the better way to go to lock in the unit that you want. The nice thing about them too is that you can avoid the daily resort fee, although there may be a cleaning fee. We had done a bit of research and really wanted to go with the vrbo Honua Kai 616, but unfortunately it was booked solid, so you really have to book far in advance. I cannot say enough good things about the owner Chris Geng- even though he had no availability, he went out of his way to help us find the perfect place to stay, helped us find current deals, and offered some great and very helpful advice.

The only time we noticed any rocks was at low tide. At high tide you would need to be in over your head in order to touch any rocks/coral with your feet. What we didn't expect were the intense trade winds. The resort is located in kind of a vortex where the winds are intensified. You can walk about 300 yards to the south and amazingly the winds, while present aren't nearly as intense as they are at the resort. That might cause us to consider other locations in the future. The only other issue we encountered was housekeeping. They never came at the same time every day. They were supposed to \"tidy\" 5 of the days we were there and \"clean\" on the others.

We usually travel to the Caribbean yearly so, this was our first trip to Hawaii. We are in our early 40s and have two children under 10 ( who did not join us for this vacation). We booked a package for a 1 bedroom unit with a mountain view. Our flight landed in Maui around 4:30pm and once we retrieved our bags and picked up a rental car, we were off to the resort. We did stop at the Costco near the airport for a few food and wine provisions, but in hindsight it wasn't necessary. It is about a 40 minute drive in moderate traffic to the resort. We were greeted by a valet who had our name on a list of arrivals for that day. He directed us to the Konea tower ( there are two tower developments) and we checked in quickly and without incident. They have car valet service at the resort, but the parking lot is less than 50 yards from the lobby entrance and we did not see the need for using it to go in and out. There is also an underground garage if you don't want your car sitting in the hot sun during the day. Our room was on the 8th floor and appeared as advertised and described. The mountain view was spectacular every morning and evening. The ocean view would have been an substantial upgrade ( in price ) and we personally found looking out at the great mountainsides as beautiful as looking at the ocean may have been. We had a large kitchen with marble counter and new Bosch appliances. A comfortable living room and dining room area that locked out to a wide balcony with more tables and chairs for outdoor seating. The balcony side of the unit was floor-to-ceiling folding glass doors which we found a great feature to the room-particularly on those breezy maui mornings. The bedroom was also very comfortable, but the dresser drawers were a bit small and shallow. It was hard to put more than a few pieces of folded clothing in them. The bathroom was very big, double sink. large glass shower and a soaker tub with nice marble and tile. There is daily maid service and they did a very good job. But if it is more than two of you in the room, be mindful of the tiny kitchen trashcan. Ours was always in need of emptying and because there was no disposal in the sink, smelly food waste could linger in the kitchen easily. On our first and last night's we ate at Duke's. This is the only restaurant on the property and tends to be busy. We had an hour wait the first night and on the last night sat in the bar area. It is not on the beach, but close enough to see sunset. The service is good, menu is pretty basic hawaiian bar food and they have live music. The Mahi sandwich really stands out, though. The pool areas of the resort are fairly small ( compared to what we've seen at other resort hotel properties ) and they appear to be heavily slanted for children. They are not very deep and there are slides and wading/play areas. The layout of the grounds is nicely done and there appeared to be wait service during the daylight hours around the pool and there are gas grills for guests to cookout if they desire. The gym was a good size and had new equipment. There isn't much of a business center, but we did use it to print out boarding passes the day before departing. The resort view rooms face each other overlooking the interior grounds. It appeared that you would become very familiar with your adjacent neighbors as you would be looking directly into each others' rooms, so keep that in mind if you desire more privacy. The resort also has a gourmet market on site ( in the main tower ) that serves as the room service provider ( if you need room service ). We did not shop at the market as we found the grocery store across from the resort more reasonably priced and with better selection. The resort is located about 15 minutes past the town of Lahaina. Because this was our first trip to the island, we did a lot of exploring to the north, east and south and did not spend much of our daylight hours at Honua Kai. Places close to the Honua Kai where we had wonderful lunches and dinners were at Mala tavern, Star Noodle and The Sea Hose. There were a fair amount of families with young children or multi-generational families ( in-laws, grandparents, etc. ) as well as honeymooners and couples like ourselves. I would absolutely stay at Honua Kai again, but for those who might expect a higher-level resort/pool experience, this may not work for them. We found it an affordable, comfortable, well-staffed venue for the type of adults-without-the-kids-getaway we planned.

We booked our trip through a Travelocity package that included flight and hotel. After reading the numerous reviews on Honua Kai, I had fairly high expectations upon arrival. Much to my surprise, most of the reviews were on-point about the resort. Here's how I break it down: ROOM & AMENITIES We got a room in the Hokulani Tower on the 7th floor. Our view out the balcony was of a huge dirt lot that we found out recently got sold to The Westin ( next door ) in which they will be expanding their property. Though it wasn't the pretty sight to see when you look out, you could see the mountains to your left and some ocean view to your right. I'm not sure if they give the \"dirt lot\" views to those who don't book directly through the hotel. Nonetheless, we were still satisfied that we got a room on a higher floor and some partial ocean view. The room itself was really nice. Like other reviewers have commented, the modern decor and the nice kitchen appliances definitely made it superb. It was convenient to have pots, pans, coffee maker, fridge, microwave, washer/dryer all in unit when spending so many days on the island. Since eating on Maui is pretty pricey, it helps you save some $$ by buying groceries at the local markets (though be warned - it's STILL pricey to buy groceries...we're looking at $3.99/lb of broccoli). SERVICE Upon check-in, the gentleman who checked us in was awesome. I wish I remembered his name. However, because our flight heading out of Maui was a red-eye, we were hoping to for a complementary check-out. When we asked one of the ladies working the desk if we could have a late check-out, she offered a noon check-out (instead of 11am) or we could pay $125 to stay until 10am. We asked if there was any way we could stay until 5pm, but apparently our only option was to pay the $125. We declined the offer and were really disappointed that a later check-out time wasn't granted after paying for 5 nights. In addition, the room service is less than to be desired. The first day, we received an additional set of shampoo/conditioner - your usual restocking of toiletries. Strangely, we didn't get restocked for the rest of the week! The towels were just stacked on the counter of the restroom. That was the extent of room service. Don't expect a whole lot in this area. There is a daily resort fee of $25 that includes parking and internet. FACILITIES The Aiina Cafe downstairs has overpriced goods but we enjoyed the fact that everything is locally grown. We had a breakfast panini there one morning and it was delicious and the portion was just right! Their gelato is also super delicious. The pool area are well maintained and we enjoyed having mai tais by the pool after a long day of snorkeling. We also used the Viking grills one night which by the way, were awesome. However, be prepared to wait as everyone seems to grill their dinners. ATMOSPHERE The location of the resort is a short drive away from the main downtown Lahaina. However, it's nice and peaceful here - if you don't mind all the kids running around everywhere.

The location is great, snorkeling right off the beach along the coral reef is super. Not a beach to body surf as the coral is close to the surface. Beware of the sharp coral if walking in at lower tide and the stinging black sea urchins. Accommodations are brand new, clean and high quality. Don't leave anything sweet out on the counters as their are some native mite/ant like creatures that will help themselves to a snack. I suggest you book through the property as you will have all of the amenities of the resort. Visit www.honuakaicafe.com and utilize the Ambassador Club Owners Discount when booking. I saved over $30 / day using the discount code 60001X mentioning the code with the resort. Duke's Restaurant on site has great food, somewhat expensive, but hey it's Maui, you are on vacation and you should be helping to boost the local economy. The gas grill area is convenient for BBQ on site. Downside, they don't allow you to bring your own alcohol drinks in the area of the grills or pool. Yes there are a fair amount of young children, but not obnoxious. Hey we were all in their shoes at one point, so just enjoy. Some reviews point out the \"awful smell\". It's there, but not constant depending on the direction of the wind. It's not grease pits from Duke's, it's the \"Poop Plant\" (Waste Water Treatment Plant) across the street and when they are stirring the pot and the wind is right, it stinks! Go sniff the Plumeria when it occurs, the flowers smell a lot better. Too bad the resort was built right across the street. I think the \"aroma\" was stronger in the original, Hokulani Tower. One hiccup during our stay, we left early for a trip to Makena (Big Beach) and when we returned later in the day, found we never had housekeeping service that day. They corrected the issue immediately when I called the front desk. Shop 4 miles down the road back to Lahaina at Safeway or Foodland for groceries and beer, wine and other alcohol. It is a bit less expensive than Times Supermarket across the street from Honua Kai. All three groceries are a lot less expensive than Aina Gourmet Market on-site in the Hokulani Tower.

I stayed in a 3BR unit from 5/15-5/19, and just about everything about the resort was top-notch. I've stayed in Wailea on Maui on previous trips, at both the Fairmont and the Four Seasons, and while those really set the standard for luxury accommodations, the Honua Kai was just as elegant and a lot more accessible. ACCOMMODATIONS: The rooms were spacious and very clean, and the master bathroom was huge! Having an extra large bath tub to bathe the kids in after a trip to the beach was great. I was traveling with another family, with a total of three kids under five, which made having a kitchen and an in-unit washer/dryer imperative. The kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, utensils, and cookware. The resort staff even included a welcome package with dish towels, laundry detergent and dishwashing liquid. The large lanai is a great place to eat breakfast, and we even cooked dinner one evening and ate it out on the lanai while watching the sunset over the ocean! Finally, the room was pretty high-tech, with individual room temperature settings, an iPod/iPhone dock that can pipe your music into any of the rooms, flat screen TVs, and a DVD/BluRay player. There are no desks, but the large dining room table or the bar area can be used easily for work. Wireless internet is available, and was included in the $25/night resort fee we paid. We had a partial ocean view that overlooked an empty lot, but also had a clear view of both the mountains and the ocean. RESORT: Honua Kai is beautiful, with lots of native plants and flowers on display. The pool area is very kid-friendly, with two different areas for toddlers to play in. The on-site restaurant Duke's is an upscale chain restaurant that has a great view of the ocean and tasty food, but is on the pricey side. I live close to a Duke's in Huntington Beach, so it felt weird to be eating at one in Hawaii. There is also a gourmet market/coffee bar that I walked through but did not get to try. There are two different fitness centers - the one in the main building is on the smaller side, but the other one is supposedly larger with more equipment. If you book through the resort, they charge a $25 fee that covers valet parking, in-room Internet access, the fitness center, etc. I personally did not mind the fee, as I got a great room rate, but I could see it bothering some people. Also, it is a little odd that the resort has \"Spa\" in the name as the spa facilities are all at the Westin property next door. The concierge can book appointments for you, and I've heard the Westin spa is excellent, but don't come expecting on-site spa service. SERVICE: Every staff member I interacted with at Honua Kai was very friendly, from the reservation agent to the front desk to the housekeeping. We would get handwritten notes from housekeeping after they cleaned our room, welcoming us to Hawaii. Requests for extra paper towels or detergent were promptly met. A maintenance worker even took the time to show me around the fitness center. One nitpick is that the pool staff, while very courteous, had a hard sell going with their sunglasses. LOCATION: Honua Kai's location is both good and bad. It's great to be in Kaanapali - there is a supermarket just one street over, awesome snorkeling nearby at Black Rock, and easy access to Lahaina. There are golf courses within 5 minute drives. Ohana Tacos (a fish taco truck) and Aloha Mixed Plate are short drives away. The downside of Honua Kai's location is the beach. The beach itself (part of Kaanapali Beach) is beautiful and not crowded at all, but lots of rocks immediately offshore means less than ideal swimming conditions, and forget about boogie boarding or anything like that. On the flipside, you can see a few fish and coral immediately offshore. Great beach for kids to play in the sand or in the shallow waters, but better water play is available further south on Kaanapali Beach or north in Napili Bay.", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cBest Place we stayed on our honeymoon in Hawaii\u201d", "Author": "Jetset101710", "ReviewID": "UR109595897", "Content": "Amazing place, everything is new, clean, and top of the line.

As for the previous visitors who compared it to the hotel next door, yes, that place is on the ocean, but they are almost IN the ocean, with no beach or grounds it seems. The Honua Kai has very nicely landscaped courtyards with koi ponds and pools, etc. Our room had a full window wall with a screen, so even the inside felt like outside.

We were staying with a 4 year old and didn't plan on much siteseeing so we'd be spending alot of time around the hotel. Check-in was a bit difficult since we got there in the early afternoon and the room wasn't available until 4PM. But the staff kept our luggage (including groceries that needed to be refrigerated from Costco) until the room was available. So, we were pleased with their flexibility. The resort is a fairly new facility with no sign of any trash, wear & tear, etc. The common areas were top-notch. Our room (#H-224) was right above the entrance with a view of the parking lot but it was still a pleasant place to stay with no outside noise. I would recommend trying to get a courtyard room on the first floor which seem to be very convenient to the pool. Rooms with views appear to be privately owned and not in the rental pool. So don't get your hopes up for an ocean view. Our unit was nicely furnished and we could make a modest breakfast in our room but getting items like salt/pepper and butter and oil for basic cooking might not be worth the trouble unless you are staying for a week or more. All utensils were available. We made us of the washer/dryer and felt we brought too many clothes since it was so convenient. Housekeeping appeared to be pretty hit or miss. Some days they'd come and some days they wouldn't but the front desk was responsive if they didn't arrive in a timely manner. There is a deli/coffee shop that appears to be open most of the day so it's convenient for getting a smoothie, sandwich or groceries. It seems to be pretty expensive though - get an iced coffee ($2) instead of a latte ($5). The pool was quite extensive with waterfall and slide and was great for small children and never seemed to get overly crowded. If you tire of the pool scene, the beach very clos. Some reviews are critical of the beach. We found it great for snorkeling with rock formations a short distance from the shore and beautiful white sand for miles. The best snorkeling is to the south around Black Rock. The trees near the shore provide ready shade so no need to rent a parasol from the hotel. But overall, it is a great beach, with plenty of snorkeling, swimming and frolicking in the waves.

We had a studio ocean view. It does not have a \"pure\" ocean view, but it still had an amazing view of the ocean and the several pools and gardens. Speaking of pools, there are probably 5-6 pools and 5-6 jacuzzis. None were crowded. In addition, we never struggled to find a great place to lay out. We would even move the lounge chairs to a grass field near the beach to watch the sunset. The room literally had everything (silverware, cups, blender, stove, microwave, soaps, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, EVERYTHING!) There were kids around, but they were all young (ages 2-10). They were not an issue at all as they were always with their families. We have a 2 year old that we did not take, so we kind of felt home sick seeing all the children. Never the less, all the kids were well behaved and polite. The \"smell\" that others speak of was non-existent. Dukes is great! We were there for dinner twice and happy hour a few times! Great prices. Do not waste your time driving to Safeway. The \"Times\" grocery store is right outside your resort and has everything. The BBQ pits on the grounds were immaculate. Viking grills cooked our steaks perfectly for dinner on the beach! The resort does pretty much shut down after 11pm, but so does the rest of the island for that matter. We had the smalles balcony which was still huge! Easily 7'x12'. Great for morning breakfasts or lunches. We had a friend stay two nights on the sofa bed and he said it too was very comfortable. We walked the beach several times and after seeing some of the \"older\" resorts, it re-assured that we made the right decision. We went zip lining which was great, a luau at another resort (not great) and snorkling at monokini (probably spelled wrong) which was great! The staff was great in suggesting things to do and places to eat. There is a small organic shop on the grounds which has all the basics, but kind of pricey. We went to relax and get away from the hustle of reality and totally made the right choice. Lots of laying out, listening to iPod by the beach/pool and reading was the highlight of our trip. There is a ton more to do in Maui, but we took advantage of the hotel to simply relax. The parking is great (underground garage takes you right ot your floor if you decide not to valet). The water had some coral, but we noticed several people snorkling and heard of no complaints.

It was hard to find ANY quiet time around the pools. It would have been nice to have at least ONE adult-only pool. There is NO daily maid service! Rooms are cleaned only every 3rd day. If you want DAILY maid service you have to pay extra for it. Also, you are issued 2 towel cards for the pool. Routine is that you give the pool attendant the 2 cards in exchange for the 2 towels....OMG-do not think about asking for extra towels, you'd think they were guarding gold or something! If you forget to turn in towels at the end of the day and get your towel cards back you have to go back to the front desk and beg for more. You are given a welcome pack when you check-in which includes ONE pack of coffee and two packs of creamer/sugars. YOU must buy any additional coffee/cream for $5. Kitchens are great, but no garbage disposals. There are NO lounge chairs ON THE BEACH, you must rent them for $10 per day! OUCH! I highly recommend this resort to anyone traveling with kids. The resort has a small water slide and children are very protected. Staff was very friendly. The hotels night bell-person was very knowledgable. He directed us to the BEST nightclub in Lahaina for hip-hop dancing \"Timba\" . He reminded me of \"The Rock\".....a beautiful simoan young man with a great attitude! There is a $25 per day resort fee, make sure you factor that in!", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Beautiful Resort!!

Originally I was looking at going to Honolulu or doing a week there & a week in Maui, however when reading the reviews for Honolulu resorts I found them all to have alot of negative reviews. I also had a co-worker that went to Honolulu for a few days & also stayed at Honua Kai in Maui for a few days. He said he wished he had stayed in Maui at Honua Kai the whole trip and that it was the most beautiful resort ever! If you can afford to stay here I would strongly recommend it... the rooms are extremely clean & stylish, the staff is very friendly and the grounds & pools are beautiful! I had always heard that Hawaii is very expensive however I didn't find that... there is a grocery store across from the resort (a short 5 min walk) where food is priced the same as at home, in the same plaza where the grocery store is there is a Mexican Restaurant & Pizza place where you can get a plate of pasta & garlic bread for $6! We ate at Duke's alot too (the restaurant at the hotel) they have a casual menu where items range from $13-$15 but you can't make reservations & should go early to get a table. The dining room side takes reservations & prices are around $25-$30. We also got coupons from the resort & from taxi drivers for free dessert or appetizers from Duke's so we never paid for dessert or calamari! Breakfast at Duke's is about $9.95 but you can grab cereal etc at the grocery store across the street & eat at the hotel. The atmosphere & staff on the resort and the whole island is amazing... the go out of their way to make sure you're having an amazing vacation. This is one place I would definitely come back to in the near future & I will be staying at Honua Kai again!", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane", "Title": "\u201cgreat place for families with children\u201d", "Author": "kimspokane", "ReviewID": "UR108254058", "Content": "Just got back today from a one week stay. The reviews I read before our stay mentioned an inordinate amount of children. I do not mind children at all and figured that it was spring break related. If you are thinking about staying here without your children then you really should take heed to the reviews here. It makes sense. It is a perfect place to stay with your children. Lazy river pool, nice grass areas, BBQ's, many little friends for the kids to meet, plenty of room in a beautifully appointed condo... beautiful grounds, Dukes is just fine for ocean front dining and kid friendly, and when your child has a fit (as all children do) you don't have the crabby people staring you down. TONS of kids. Our children are older and we left them home. We travel to Hawaii 2-3 times per year. Waited until we were sure, spring break around the country was done, weather at home was still bad and occupancy was not too high at the resorts. I really like the privacy of a condo vs. hotel and ability to make coffee, bbq, sit out and watch the sunset... but many of the condos in Maui are getting a bit old and shabby. The older condominiums have the ocean front units that are truly oceanfront but you risk the potential of a bad bed, dirty old furniture... We stayed at Sugar Beach Resort last year, fleas ate my husband, and the bed was marginal at best. We have previously stayed there many times and loved it but decided that we did not want to risk a bad unit again. Have also stayed at the Westin Villas but had a top floor ocean front unit and so still had the privacy and the view, no units to look across at... I looked at booking an \"ocean view\" at the westin, I guess they do not typically book the oceanfronts unless you are an \"owner\" and they wanted $800/nt for the ocean view. I did notice many less children at the Westin but that was a couple of years ago. We booked this trip a week in advance and got a good last min deal on the condominium thru vrbo. Ocean view one bedroom inner courtyard, top floor. Unit was beautiful. No complaints with the rental company. Only complaint I had with unit was two pillows for two people. They had some extra pillows in the closet but no extra pillowcases. I think the most important thing you need to think about is what you want from your vacation. Our unit was inner courtyard so no noise from the road as the mountain views and outer units has. We did have a good ocean view. About four units down the side bank of the U shape. The negative for me was the communal sense I felt while sitting on the Lanai. I like to wake up in the morning and sit on the Lanai, drink a cup of coffee, listen to the ocean, and watch sunrise/sunset... This trip was not that. I wake up early, as do most travelers to Maui, as at this time of year pacific coast time is three hrs. behind. So this means at 6am when I sat on the Lanai there was already many, many, many babies in the courtyard, laughing, swimming, screaming, playing.. My husband was also baffeled at the amount of little ones. But after we thought about it it made sense. Most of these units are two and three bedrooms. Most Lanais were filled early morning with grandparents, parents and their little ones. There were not many school age kids at this resort during our visit. The majority were 5 and under. If it does not bother you to have the little privacy from your neighbors and the kids then it's a great place to stay. If you have little kids then it's a great place to stay. If you want privacy and not a ton of little ones then it's not the place for you. Other good points. All the families we met were very nice. Good parents, grandparents.. Not the type of place where someone will take your belongings at the beach or pools. Also the type of place where if someone did try to take your stuff while you were in the ocean my guess is that someone else would prevent it. The ocean in front of the resort has coral. Not the best beach spot for swimming but great for kids to play in the sand and splash in the waves. Also very populated. We left each day and went to other beaches. Had a great time at some very unpopulated beautiful sandy beaches and were gone most of the days. The store actually does have some good deals and items that you don't find at Costco or Wallmart. Beer is $12/six pack of Coors lite ($23 for a 30 pack at times grocery) but they had some salads that were excellent ($6 which is good when you figure the cost of purchasing these ingreidents) and local with yummy dressing, pickeled ginger for $3/jar which is what we would pay at home and some organic items that were local and not too high priced. Coffee. I like to buy local but I have never been a fan of any hawaiian coffee. Very bitter in my opinion. Some people love it though, so just my opinion. The market on site sells local coffee $19. for 8oz. It was terrible. Very bitter. There is a starbucks down the road that will grind you some fresh coffee for half the price. Overall we had a very relaxing time. I would stay here again with my kids. Would love to find that perfect condo that is a bit more private, ocean front and totally remodeled but did not find it. Would recommend this place over a hotel as it has the hotel immenities and the condo feel. Good rooms, grounds, hot tubs, pools, sand on the beach, walking path... withing walking distance to blackrock if you choose (about 20min). Dukes was very relaxing and good service. No wait and fairly good inexpensive food for Maui. Only other rec. If you know how to drive you should probably rent a car at the airport upon arrival. They are very inexpensive.

Showed us how the wall door windows to pation opened and worked. Great way to make a good first impression. The Resort grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Lots of pools and jacuzzi's. Very family friendly atmosphere. Lots of activities at site for kids of all ages. We were with family of six adults and one toddler. Large grassy area for kids to run around, play, throw balls. The cleaning staff was friendly, quick, and effiecient. She even gave us extra coffee, filters, detergent for washer and dishwasher. Nice beach on resort property with good snorkeling. Very relaxed atmosphere, plenty of staff on duty to take care of needs. The place was clean and the equipment and furnishings were in good working order. Plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas around pool areas. Lots of shallow areas for kids and young children to play in. Easy access to the beach with lounge chairs available to take with you. There may have been a charge for the chairs but not sure, we just used the beach towels provided and the beach mat from our room. There was a restaurant on site (Duke's) that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and a little coffee and sandwich shop in the lobby area. The Resort location was close to many great beaches, golf courses, shopping areas, and local attractions. Plenty to do withing a 15 minute drive. Everything is priced high, expect to pay $10 or more for a burger in any restaurant. Places like McDonalds is still relatively cheap compared to everything else. Groceries are high also but you can save some money by preparing some of your meals in the suite. We mainly made our own breakfast, packed fruit and snacks for lunch then ate out for dinner. There is a little grocery store about 2 blocks from Resort that has a great wine selection called \"The Times\". There is a Safeway about five minutes away going toward Lahaina with a number of shops there. The town of Lahaina has all kinds of shopping and places to eat with some historical buildings and sites.

For us, it was the ideal hotel. LOVED the fact that it had a washer/dryer and full kitchen. The kitchen is very well stocked with plenty of cooking supplies... even had a blender. We had a continuous supply of laundry soap, dryer sheets, dish soap etc. There is also a broom, mop, and bucket for tidying up all that sand you will inevitably track in. We had no problem with the housekeeping. They give fresh towels,remove trash, make beds daily and also change sheets every 3rd day. I found it very easy to do a quick tidy up every day after we came in from the beach, and would do a load of laundry daily. Even though other guests have mentioned they had a few issues with housekeeping, we thought it was fine. The room was very quiet and comfortable. The beach is awesome for snorkeling. On a clear day you can see where the coral is very easily, so you just swim out in the channels between the coral until you are in deep enough water not to touch it, and you will see loads of beautiful fish. As for lots of kids at the pool.... yes, there was, but we just avoided the pools since the warm ocean is literally right there. If you have read previous reviews about the notorious odor... really, it is not an issue. I am very sensitive to stinky smells and I wasn't bothered by it at all. I would say in the week we were there, I caught a very fleeting whiff maybe 3 or 4 times. No big deal. Dukes restaurant is awesome. It is on the pricey side, but really delicious. My hubby and I are very picky about restaurant food and both loved the two dinners we ate there. We found the Safeway in Lahaina Cannery Mall to be a good place to grocery shop. It is only a few minutes from Honua Kai right off Hwy. 30, very easy to locate. If you want to use the fitness room, go to the one in the Konea Tower. It is excellent. Many cardio machines, treadmills, recumbent bikes, ellipticals, and great weight machines and free weights. The best fitness room of any hotel we have been in to date.

We asked for a 1 bedroom and they gave us a 1 bedroom with den, which was nice. And although, the place is nice. It does feel more like a hotel rather than home. Our view was looking at the property next door (The Mahana) and the partial ocean view was very accurate. You could see the ocean, if you looked to your far left and between the buildings. A bit disappointing. On our first morning there, I went down to the front desk and asked if they had any oceanFRONT or oceanVIEW rooms available. She searched and I think really tried to help us, but they had nothing. The problem is the two buildings are shaped like a \"U\" and the end units, or top of the \"U\" ,are the only ones that are truly oceanFRONTand these are all privately owned. The owners of these units have not put their units into the rental pool, so if you book via VRBO or HomeAway or something like that, you MAY get lucky, but I doubt it. The only oceanVIEW, not oceanFRONT units, the main desk had were a grand total of 7 units and none of them were available. So, our options were to stay where we were and look at the property next door or move two units closer to the beach, but still only partial oceanVIEW, yet pay another $100 per night?!? OUCH. We were already paying $480 (including the $25 resort fee) per night. I guess what surprised me the most was that they have so few oceanVIEW units in the rental pool! And, if you want oceanFRONT -- forget about it! The other problem with the layout of the building is that it is so far away from the pool and the beach. You need to hike to get to the beach and the action at the pool. We prefer to just go down the elevator and walk out the lobby doors when staying somewhere near a beach. No such luck at Honua Kai. You have to walk through the large lobby, then the large gardens, then through the pool area and then you finally reach the beach. Uggh. Other than that, Honua Kai is okay. They have an organic market that is EXTREMELY expensive in the lobby. We used the Kids club and it was okay. ($15 per hour per kid). The pools/waterslide was fun, but our kids would have been happy in a regular pool too. Dukes Restaurant was very crowded and we decided to skip it the one night that we were planning on going there because the wait was 35 mins and our kids were hungry. We went at about 5pm. The fitness room is really small. It only has a couple of machines. We never found the spa - not sure where that was? Front desk were nice. Housekeeping was slow. All in all, it was okay. Not great. Not bad. Just okay. Very expensive. So, we decided to check out early! We only stayed at Honua Kai 5 nights, when we were booked for 15 nights. I hated coming into our hotel room and looking out the window at the property next door, which we knew was oceanFRONT. Our bill at Honua Kai was $2500.00 for 5 nights. So, we moved next door to The Mahana. We have stayed at The Mahana before and ALL the units are oceanFRONT!! It is wonderful. Yes, the pool is smaller and no they don't have valet parking. However, you cannot beat the location and the views!! Depending on what unit you get, some are upgraded (ie granite counter tops, new appliances, tiled floors etc.). You just need to be picky about which unit you take and the front desk will let you look at several until you find the unit that you like. They also have reciprocal privileges with Kaanapali Shores (two doors down) who do have a kids club and a restaurant. We LOVED our stay at The Mahana and we will be back again next year!!

My husband and I travelled a lot before having a child, and we would have never picked a place like this in the past. But at this point in our lives, this place was perfect! We had a partial ocean view 1 bedroom and den unit in the Konea building (newer - under 2yrs old?), unit 540. The ocean could be seen from the lanai, but unfortunately, the property next door was constantly maintaining their surroundings - leaf blower, lawn mower etc..., so I wasn't always able to enjoy sitting outside (while my daughter was napping in the afternoon) to enjoy the smell of the ocean, the beautiful waters etc..... We did however see whales one eveing from our lanai. If I could request for any part of the resort, I think I would pick the Hoku Lani tower, with a unit facing the Konea tower. You would be able to get an ocean view, and it appeared to be quiet. As other reviewers have mentioned, the unit was new, modern, luxurious and tastefully decorated. We had a very comfortable pillow-top bed, huge living space (inside and out), Bosch kitchen and laundry appliances, huge bathroom, and all the comforts you could ask for. The only downside is the weak housekeeping. I have to say that it did get better as our week went by. We didn't get housekeeping services in the first 2 days there....was it because they came by while my daughter was napping and we had the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign up? Regardless, when we called the Housekeeping line to request for service, the voicemail box was full. No big surprise! I had read about the housekeeping before going on this trip, so my expectations were low. When we called the front desk, they told us that housekeeping services ends at 4pm, so... \"did we need lots of cleaning\"? The fact that we have to pay a $25 daily resort fee which includes DAILY housekeeping, I would expect nothing less. Before booking our accomodations, I did consider renting a unit at the HK directly from an owner (via VRBO), but many of them do not offer daily housekeeping. That was a deal breaker for me, as I figure....if I'm on vacation, why would I want to make the bed, do laundry to get fresh towels etc...? Anyways, as I said, the housekeeping greatly improved after a couple of days (and that's without any complaints to the resort). Perhaps someone else did the complaining for us? The pools were awesome! I do wish they had more \"kiddie\" slides for younger children, but overall, it was great! The pools are heated, so it was the perfect temp to jump right in! (although I think the heater was broken the first couple of days we were there coz' the water was really cold!). Thank goodness they fixed it! Downside....I did get quite a few mosquito bites sitting by the shrubs.......beware!! The valet service was good. Call 10-15mins ahead before going down. Dukes Restaurant was always busy! I would recommend making a reservation (available on OpenTable or directly with Dukes) if you are planning on having dinner. The Lava Flow drink was yummy! For on-line flight check-in, there is a computer in the Hoku Lani tower (not Konea) that you can use to check-in and print your boarding passes. There is a pretty big grocery store directly across the street from the resort - the Times Supermarket. Really convenient! They had everything under the sun! Sunblock, water/beach toys, food, drinks, alcohol.... For those of you with young children, there is also a playground just a one minute (drive) down the road - turn left out of the resort. If you have a car, here are some restaurants that we really enjoyed: Mama's Fish House in Paia (REALLY expensive but a MUST - stuffed Mahi Mahi - simply FABULOUS), Star Noodle in Lahaina (dangerously delicious martinis, Seafood Dynamite was to die for - we went twice in a week!!), Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina (really affordable and good food - very casual), and Maui Tacos in Lahaina (extremely casual and good mahi mahi tacos). We have been to Maui twice, and have stayed in Wailea and Ka'anapali. We enjoyed both areas very much, but I have to say that the beaches in Wailea are amazing! We will definitely consider going back to the Honua Kai on our next trip to Maui. The big question is.....when are we going back??

Likely not. Then again, we wouldn't find cooking on vacation particularly romantic, so we wouldn't pick a condo hotel in the first place. However, for a family vacation with kids (8 & 10), this was the best hotel we have ever vacationed at, by far. Value: We booked this as part of a package with Costco. As compared to other lodging options we had for this package, this was by far the best value. Room: Pristine. Huge refrigerator, great appliances, nice blender, all the utensils/cookware one might need. Very nice washer & drier in the room. Fast Wi-Fi. Pools & Beach: Simply outstanding. Views of the ocean from beach loungers. Convenient walkways between the beach and the pools and a nice paved walkway along the beach. Service: We didn't need much. The Concierge (Sherry) was great. All the suggestions she had (Hike Maui, Pacific Whale Foundation, Old Lahaina Luau) worked out great. Location/Convenience: We walked almost the entire beach walk in Lahaina. While there were other fancier hotels (Westin condos, Hyatt), none of them on balance seemed as ideally located as this place. It was far enough from the strips of hotels in downtown Lahaina, yet not as desolate as the hotels further up north in Kapalua. There is a strip mall across the street with a nice food market, a decent pizza place, and a great coffee/sandwich shop. For our situation, it was ideal. Resort Fee: Yes, there is a $25 per night fee. But for that we got convenient garage parking, and wi-fi that actually worked. Seems like a fair deal to me. My only complaint: While I saw waiters from Duke's roaming around the pools, not once did one of them approach me to ask if I wanted to order a drink, That really has nothing to do with the hotel, but given that it is the only bar on the hotel property, that really was a bummer.

Doubtful we would go back. The property is lovely and well kept. It has a nice location and the grounds are lovely. The service is good, but the maid service is kept at a minimum. This is a place that desperately wants to be an all condo property so it seems they rent out rooms to keep it going. There are several areas where there will be additional building but that seems to be stopped at the moment. The beds were hard as a rock and both myself and husband woke up sore and tired each day. We finally slept on top of the comforter and that helped a bit. The room was nice. Everything is quality and full kitchen were great along with the washer and dryer. Now for the reason we wont go back. KIDS! This place is overun with children. I dont dislike children, far from it, but the noise level here is amazing. We did stay during what is traditionally spring break, but the noise was unreal. Most of the parents I saw had toddlers and that precludes the spring break theory. From 4:30am to 10:30 pm the screaming that goes on is like a preschool gone bad! The older kids arent the problem, its the screaming younger children. The shape of the hotel (think horseshoe) makes echoes that dont stop. I understand that people travel with small children, but this place has the motherlode of toddlers. With the pools that are on the property, people take their darlings out first thing in the morning and dont bring them in until dark. With the time change, many people have their youngsters out VERY early because they are awake with their schedule from home. Also the amount of unsupervised kids(7-10 yrs) was surprising. There was group of kids harassing the koi in one of the ponds in the lobby area. There was never an adult around...........nice parenting. There was a unit across from us (we were on the 5th level) that had it lights on day and night with no one in the room. Made for bright nights. Also the air conditioning is weird. You cant change it. We ended up keeping the doors open all night to cool things down a bit and the neighbors across the way made it way lighther than we like it. It was either dark and too hot or light and a bit cooler. The maid service was a bit strange. They take the towels and trash every day or rather they are SUPPOSED to and change the sheets every third day. We were in and out one day and came back in the afternoon and no maid. We left again and told the front desk we hadnt had any service that and they said they would let housekeeping know. We got back 3-4 hours later still nobody had been in the room. At that point we needed toilet tissue and towels which we got after I once again it went down and told the front desk. Was told the manager would be told but never heard a word from them..................For the price we were paying I expected a bit more professionalism from whomever is the manager. The management should do themselves a favor and have some \"adult\" only areas. They have an abundance of pools and the newer tower is set up a bit differently so it would be easy to make some areas more adult friendly. At this point I would NOT go back.

We were surprised, however, by the $25 a day resort fee for amenities we weren't using (the safe in our room was broken, we didn't use the internet, business center or gym--we were on vacation, duh!) and we weren't able to opt out of access to these unwanted \"amenities\". It just seems like another way to gouge customers for every penny possible. Also, we couldn't escape from kids. They were everywhere and were largely out of control. This would be fine, if there were an adults only area. We went to the bar to seek refuge and sure enough, there were children eating kids meals at the bar! Also, on the resort map they have labeled the \"serenity pool\" which sounds like a fancy way of saying \"adults only\" but it was the pool with the water slide and thus, filled with children. Overall, this hotel has a great location and great food (Duke's was really lovely), but the sneaky fees and shouting children really detracted from our experience. I don't think we'll be returning unless they increase their accommodations for guests who are traveling sans offspring.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Park Ridge, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel We've Ever Stayed In\u201d", "Author": "kidonaki", "ReviewID": "UR102929701", "Content": "HOTEL: Great room. Just as their web site says. No gimmicks. It was renovated. Clean. Roomy. Maid service was weak. That's my only complaint. Other hotels we've stayed at, the balcony is so small we don't use it. But this balcony was HUGE. It had a large dinette AND lounge furniture. 5 of us would go out there to eat and play games. I wish I had upgraded to the ocean view given how much we used the balcony. We got a room on the south side of the resort and we had a view of a big pile of dirt. It looked like a future construction site. You will not be disappointed staying at this hotel. MAUI ACTIVITIES: Beware of the concierge. They try to stare you away from free activities and push the paying activities. If you have internet, highly recommend on-line research. HIKING WAIHEE RIDGE TRAIL : (5 stars) did this hike with my kids ages 9, 10 & 12 and my husband. I was very concerned about my 9 year old but she had no problem with it. In fact she kept up easily and she LOVED it. All 3 of the kids loved it. And let me note here that they hated the road to Hana. They hated being stuck in car for 6 hours to \"look at trees\". But they loved, loved, loved this. This ranked higher than zip lining and horseback riding and it was free! btw, the concierge tried to talk me out of this and do surfing lessons instead at $60pp. So glad I didn't listed to her. ROAD TO HANA: (3 stars) My husband and I loved it. Kids hated it. They also got car sick. Don't recommend for young kids. SNORKELING: (5 stars) All loved it. HORSEBACK RIDING at Ironwood ranch: (1star) My horse got bumped by the guide's horse and had a fit right over the edge of a cliff. Very scary. Otherwise fun for me. Kids didn't care for it. Given the mishap, I would not put my kid on a horse for safety reasons. I called the ranch directly and paid $80 pp. The concierge quoted me $90pp. ZIP LINING: (2 stars) Maui Plantation: This was okay. There were 5 lines. 14 people in our group. We spent more time waiting for everyone to get across than on the line. The lines were very short. Wouldn't do it again. It wasn't worth the money. Kids didn't care for it either. WHALE WATCHING: (2 stars) This is like going to a zoo and overlooking the whale tank for 2 hours from a distance. At first it was cool but it got boring pretty fast. Kids got bored. We saw about 10 whales.

Thanks for your help with shopping bag, groceries, and everything. Not a Con: House keeping does not thoroughly cleans the room. We had a huge room; 3bd 3bth full kitchen. All he/she does is give you fresh towels, make your bed, throw away your trash, provided unlimited amounts of tp, shampoo, and soap. Don't expect the floors to be swept, tables cleaned, or dishes washed. We maybe asking for too much but we wanted the dishes washed. Who wants to wash dishes on vacation. PS: If you are a young African American with an urban look don't be surprised if the concierge or other hotel employees say a few slang word like \"bomb\" instead of great or \"gangsta\" instead of cool to make you comfortable. It's funny. Blacks only make up 3% of Hawaii population and it is even less in Maui. To see blacks is a rarity (I think me my wife and my friend were the only 4) at the hotel but they are glad to see us. Talk to the locals they think we are interesting and want to know more about us. Dont feel out of place if other vacation look at you like \"Why are you in \"my\" Maui?\". Have fun. Feel exclusive and put on that sunscreen. Expectations: There are no resort activities such as Luaus, bar tending on the beach, fireworks and such. Just plain ole vacation and relaxation at Honua Kai. Rating: Cleanliness 4/5 I really wanted the dishes washes and the toilets, shower, and tubs cleaned. Value: 3/5 For $4500 a week. I really wanted more to do on the resort than swim and eat at Dukes. Overall: Loved it. Once they start hiring entertainment. I'll give you that extra point. 4/5 For the readers: Deluxe room are the real Ocean Views. Ocean views are truly Partial ocean views. Partial ocean view are smaller rooms with a corner lanai view the ocean and grounds. Further back though. Garden view is ground level. I warned you.

The grounds resembled one of the mega resorts of cancun and area....not your typical hawaiian pool, chairs, beds and some palm trees. Check out the sites pictures for yourself, they speak for themselves. The 2 bedroom we stayed in was most of the reason we decided to book - brand new in all aspects...even under the sink smelled clean and kept (try to find another condo/hotel with that comment :) Beds are double pillowtop, 3 large HDTV's, fantastic appliances, etc - absolutely perfect in every way We snagged a 2 bedroom with an ocean-view for a 50% upcharge from a partial ($150/night more) - be careful here....from the room itself you cannot see the ocean AT ALL...all there is to see is the rooms on the other side of the courtyard. In order to see the ocean you have to be on your deck. Beach is superb, not really any different than any other W.Maui location (we tried them all for a reason - see below) - snorkling right outside was amazing as well....turtles and fish everywhere - even saw the odd sea snake and eel. Pools, lazy river, water slide and hot tubs were fantastic - service around the pool was a little sub-par though (could have used more staff) The Deli in the main level was fantastic - expensive, but if that meets your expectations you will love it. Had coffee and a muffin every morning (8) Overall service was great, valet car service took about 2 minutes to snag our jeep - bravo! We stayed March 19th to 28th - I would avoid this timeframe and anythign around it if you want to stay at this hotel or anywhere nearby - wind, wind, wind, wind and more wind. I honestly have to say it was the most wind I've experienced in my life, anywhere. For 7 days it blew so hard that the backs of the beach chairs were flipping over onto the chair and flying apart (and yes, they were made of steel). Numerous times during the afternoon you would find the pool area completely vacated...terrible. Now the strange part...if you drove south of the hotel (as little as 2-3 miles) the wind would be reduced considerably...or in 5 of the days, completely gone! From 40mph to zero...immediately. For those you you that know Maui quite well its easy to understand why development took so long to move north of the blackrock area....trade-wind central. The locals in the area said this year was abnormally windy, but they discouraged staying north of blackrock in the late Mar-Apr timeframe. This is not a problem with the hotel or service in any way....simply a recommendation to think elsewhere during these times.

We arrived the night of March 10th for a six night stay. The staff was very professional...especially how they handled the approaching tsunami, providing hourly updates and when the time came, instructing those on lower floors to move higher-up in the building. Our Room 543, of the newer North Building, was perfect. The unit we had was a two bedroom ocean view. While I was a little disappointed in the \"ocean view,\" we could get a limited view of the water if you stood on the nice sized balcony and turned to the right. I was not impressed with Duke's...very high prices, and a split menu depending upon where you wanted to be seated. Some in our family wanted a nice steak dinner while others wanted a burger and to sit closer to the water. We settled for a small table near the bar so family members could order from both the \"upscale\" and \"casual\" menus. Kind of silly if you ask me! Don't spend to much time looking for the Spa...there isn't one. Also, Don't waste too much time in the onsite market located in the south building. There is a very nice grocery store, Times Supermarket, right across the street from the resort which has much more reasonable prices, for Maui anyway. Final Con...No business office! However, they do have a PC setup with a link to all the airlines to print your boarding passes before heading to the airport. The Pools are OK...more of a hit with younger kids would be my bet. The pools lack some of the excitement the teen and pre-teen have come to expect these days. However, for us adults it does keep the noise level down. The hot tubs, and there are several located throughout the pool area, were great. Another nice feature you'll enjoy are the many BBQ grills located around the pool areas.

Our calls to housekeeping have gone completely unanswered. Plus there is no \"Do Not Disturb\" signs and no chain locks. Housekeeping shows up early, gets you up and then often doesn't come back!

To add to the comments already written: 1) View - many units face into each other or face the mountains, a bit disappointing, but not surprising if you look carefully at the building layout. The Hotel staff cannot guarantee where your room will be until you check in, but are helpful if you are disappointed, (and if the hotel's not full). The Hotel management was excellent to deal with. Note - if you book direct from an owner, there's little connection to the hotel staff, and you can't charge items to your room. 2) Beach - there's lots of loose coral pieces, and a solid bed of coral just a few feet into the water in front of the hotel. Many people were getting cut even with water shoes. At low tide, it's not very safe for swimming or body surfing, but better at high tide when the water comes higher up the sandy shoreline. We drove to the other Kaanapali beach (Whaler's Village area) for swimming and body surfing. The ocean area near the Hotel, (directly in front of the Westin Villas and the empty lot) is great for snorkeling. 3) Pools - great pools, good variety, a bit shallow at 3'. 4) House keeping not well trained - even though we hung our towels to re-use them, the housekeepers replaced them every day, but never replenished toilet paper, kleenex, or paper towels, or swept the kitchen which had sand etc. and really needed a sweep. 5) Appliances - the Bosch d/w cleaned so poorly, we had to wash everything by hand. The washer/dryer was very hard on the clothes. The 'delicate' cycle ran longer than most 'regular' cycles, and our clothes came out looking 'pilled'. 6) Building Amenities - There are 2 Buildings, the Honua Kai (first building), and Konea (second building). Aina Market (gourmet grocer, coffee, gifts, take out food, wine etc.) is located in the first building (Honua Kai), as is the Children's Activity Centre. There's no coffee bar, or retail in the second building (Konea), so you must walk to the other building for coffee, sundries, ice etc. The Fitness Centre in the Konea Building is 3x times the size of the one in the H.K. Bldg. 7) Lap pool - there's no separate 'lap pool'. The pool in front of the H.K. is long and wide, and you can swim laps if it's not busy, but with so many families in the pool, it's pretty hard to swim laps unless you go very early before anyone's there. 8) Food Stores - Near the airport there's a Costco and new Whole Foods (better prices than in Canada). Near the Hotel, there's several grocers incl. Times (across the street), Safeway and Foodland Farms (between Lahaina and the Hotel). Foodland Farms is very nice, similar to Whole Foods, cleaner than Safeway, with better produce prices. The Foodland Farms s/c has a Barnes and Noble, and a great Vitamin Shop. All the grocers sell beach toys, boards etc. 9) Concierge - very knowledgeable for booking activities. The Beach Activity rental booth has a full range of beach and sun items to rent or buy, more $$ than a retail store, but convenient. 10) Construction - there was no construction while we were there, but there is an empty lot beside the first Building and guest comments (from those who stayed in February) mentioned construction noise?

Last year, we stayed in a private house on a beautiful property up in Lahaina. Since we have small kids, (6,8) we thought a resort style condo on the beach with multiple pools would be exciting for the kids. WELL, We're totally impressed.. 1) Rooms - spacious 1 bedroom. Yes we face the mountain views overlooking the parking lot but since we are on the 10th floor, it doesn't bother us much. The mountains are gorgeous. Actually, after a hot sunny day, this side is nice and breezy without the hot sun. AND quite honestly we're on the beach each night watching the sunset anyways. On arrival, our room had coffee (couple days worth) , filters (total for our stay), dishwasher liquid, laundry detergent, bounce sheets and shampoo/lotion. The cleaning supplies get replenished daily or as needed so you don't have to go out and purchase a big jug of anything. You also have daily service which includes towel renewal, removal of garbage/recycling, cleaning of your counters and making beds with existing linens. Every 3 days, they change your linens and vacuum the suite. Along with free parking AND Valet, all of this is included in your $25 resort fee. 2) The Property/ pools - Lots of grassy spots for the kids to run around. The boardwalk starts at our condo and goes past the westin, all the way to the Sheraton at Black Rock. Great place for a walk or run. The pools are great with lots of variety (large pool, a water slide pool, a pool with a cave/waterfall and hot tubs attached to all the pools so that you don't have to go too far looking for a cozy spot). You get towel cards for the pool.. exchange your card for a towel and get the card back when returning the towel. Seemed a bit odd at first but it's a no brainer. At the end of the day, give them your wet towel and you can get either your towel card back or a freshly clean dry towel for next time. :) 3) Restaurant - Duke's is GREAT. It's our 10 year anniversary so we went there the first night for supper. The prices were reasonable when compared to other nearby restaurants (and really, cheaper than most) and the food was fantastic. We both had local special fish that just melted in our mouths. The next day we went there for lunch ...the hamburgers are tremendous and only $11 . They come with great wedge fries. BONUS for us is that kids meals were cheap ($5) and delicious. Mind you the drink was not included with the kids meal. We plan to go here one more time before going home. 4) The beach. - sandy in many locations. Many reviewers write about the rocky beach, but right in front of our resort all the way and past the Westin, the beach is very sandy and the water is swimmable. If you stay further north , then the beach is minimal and very rocky. We spent tons of time boogie boarding and snorkeling on our beach. Lots of fish. 5) Aina market - over priced along with all the beachside stuff you can purchase. $15 for beach toys that you can buy at ABC for $8. Lovely family friendly resort with service that is expected at a condo (kind, respectful, helpful, but from a distance (which I love)).

Wonderful bathroom with the bath tub and the shower. There is a barbecue area, so you can grill your own food. Very nice pools. All the staff was very friendly and helpful at any time. The only thing that I will suggest to younger couples, who want to have more fun- you should choose different hotel, since this is more family friendly resort (at least it was mostly young couples with young children at the time when we were there). Even if we don't have any children, we had an amazing time anyway, since we were looking to relax and not go out to much. There is no one thing that I could complain about.

The hotel did a great job and announced status after each siren. We had to be on alert to evacuate but luckily that never happened. Other than that....... I had booked directly with the hotel for a one bedroom ocean view but got upgraded to a two bedroom when we got there. The condo is just beautiful and well equipped. Whale season is in full swing and the first night we we there, while dining at Duke's, two whales came up and breached very close off shore right in front of the restaurant! Couldn't ask for more than that.....and no need to pay for a whale watching trip as the entire time we were there you could see plenty of whales from the view off our lanai. Very spectacular! Assuming you have been reading the other reviews for this place I will try and hit the points mentioned. Beachwalk- great can go for a long way if you like to walk Beach in front of the hotel-yes a lot of coral so not great for swimming but excellent for snorkeling and well worth doing it, lots of fish Pools-good and plenty of room for everyone Times market across street from hotel- Good and well supplied Specialty market at hotel- Good for specialty items Housekeeping- read the card so you know what to expect.They do just a resupply of towels etc each day and clean every 3rd day of your stay. Personally I liked this because it was not disruptive. Duke's restaurant- food is not bad but not great. Atmosphere is great because of location and their nightly entertainment was good. Much better dining available in nearby Lahaina namely MaLa Ocean Club. Decent Chinese restaurant called China Boat right up the street north of the resort.

It was the best vacation I was ever on and the Honua Kai resort was a big part of the reason why. In a nutshell - the rooms were fantastic. The lanai was huge and beautiful (even with the less expensive \"mountain view\" which was spectacular every day.) The kitchen had brand new appliances all in stainless steel. Having a kitchen was great - it saved us a ton of money, mostly because we sleep late so we work up at about noon and had breakfast for lunch in the hotel, and then went out for dinner. The concierge we had (Heather) was super helpful - she set up a snorkeling trip for us and gave us some great advice on local beaches. She also set up a luau for us but that got rained out and was already too late in our vacation to reschedule. Heather was awesome and was there at the beginning of our trip. Later in our trip we made two phone calls to the concierge desk, both were not returned in a timely manner and caused us to lose some time. This is part of the reason why I gave them a 3 on service. Housekeeping at Honua Kai was strange. The first couple of days they came super early in the morning (we were still adjusting from eastern standard time so we were awake and in the room. We turned them away but they came back later and serviced the room, which we thought was awesome. Later in the stay (when we were just sleeping in) they did not return to the room. Also - there was a note that said that laundry and dishwasher detergent would be restocked every day. It was never restocked. When I complained I got one packet of laundry detergent. Since we were only staying a week, this got us through, but it was a pain. We didn't really care that housekeeping didn't come back to our room on the back end of our trip back to our rooms after being turned away, but it says something about the consistency. Also - we weren't really sure what housekeeping did other than replacing the towels and making the bed. The rest of the room didn't seem particularly cleaned up at any time. All of this though is nit-picky, I would totally recommend this place to anyone (and beg them to take me with them lol) There is a lot made of an odd smell when staying at Honua Kai. There appears to be a waste managment plant nearby that I think produces the smell, which is mostly prevalent on the mountain side of the hotel and is most prominent actually a mile or two down 30 closer to Lahaina. I guess if your sensitive to this sort of thing it could be a problem. My wife hated it more than I did but in all honesty it forced us to sleep with the air conditioner on one night instead of with the linai open. Another thing the Honua Kai gets a bit of a bad rap for is the swimming conditions at the beach. It's true that there is a lot of coral right in and that the water is shelly. This is a potentially bad thing if you are a body surfer, I get that and was a bit disappointed myself however I must say that for snorkeling the beach outside the hotel was terrific! I saw more fish and closer to my person outside the hotel than I did on an actual snorkeling trip. Also - on my last day there I wore water shoes and just swam (conditions weren't good for snorkeling). The water shoes protected my feet from the shells, and about 15 feet out the water is too deep for me to stand (at 6 ft tall). There is a good spot though - if you are facing the ocean and take the walkway that is just to the left of Duke's and walk down about 50 yards or so to your left; you'll find a part of the ocean that (when I was there) wasn't very shelly or corally. There was an old broken grill attached to one of the trees there. There you will find a nicer sandy entrance to the ocean - it's totally good enough to swim at as the coral doesn't start until the water is almost 7 or 8 feet deep. I would go to this resort again in a heart beat. My wife and I are considering going again by bagging our normal Jersey shore vacation in lieu of going to maui for another week. Oddly enough it seems more expensive in the summer than in the winter when traditionally hawaii is supposed to be cheaper. All in all, you can't go wrong staying here. One final thing to note. The \"complimentary\" computer in the main tower that they let you use to print your boarding passes is terrible. The internet at Honua Kai was amazingly fast - the fastest of any hotel I've ever stayed at (wired, I didn't try wireless). That being said I while I was using the complementary computer I had nothing but problems. The computer threw up all kinds of java script errors when I tried to print, so I was unable to print. I work in IT and wanted to see if any other processes were running. I did a little snooping around and found that the machine isn't running an antivirus program (or it is disabled) and was running incredibly slow. All potential indicators of viruses or malware. I should have reported this to the hotel, but I was running extremely late for my flight and needed to just leave.

Dukes is alright for the odd visit but it's not fine dining. It is however convenient, reasonably cheap by Maui standards and quite lively. For us one of the big hits was the fitness centre. It has just enough equipment and space to keep you on track. It's air conditioned and has a bathroom and water cooler, towels, stationary bikes, treadmills, a couple of weight machines and a few free weights up to fifty pounds. Another big hit was the boardwalk. At a gentle pace you can go for an hour all the way to the southern tip of Kaanapali beach. That's a two hour walk there and back. If inclined you can stop halfway at Whalers Village and shop or grab a coffee. But do it reasonably early for the sun gets hot quickly.

My husband has celiac disease and the staff were very well informed and accommodating, recommending dishes and then checking over his order with the chef. The meal was expensive (around 100$ for appetizers, dinner, drinks and coffee for two) but well worth it. There is also a gourmet market on the premises. They also were well informed about allergies and carried a variety of foods, including some gluten free. It too was expensive but many of their products, including the coffee, is grown on their own local farm and much in the store was local, supporting local producers. Nice to see. What else can I say.

The lanai with the Nana doors were also amazing. When I travel to Hawaii though, I want to spend my time on the beach. While this is an oceanfront resort, it's true that it's pretty hard to swim/boogie board on the beach in front of the resort because of the amount of coral.

It was memorable because it was the first vacation with our son who is four months old. My wife and I love to travel, but with all the horror stories of traveling with babies out there, we were a little bit nervous, or at least I was. Being our first time, we were bound to make a few mistakes, like forgetting the swaddle that our son uses to sleep at night or the base that we use for the car seat, but those were minor bumps which we handled with ease. The flight was perfect, 5 hours straight, and our son handled the take-off with ease. The pacifier helped him become acclimated to the air pressure, and he was his normal cheery self for the whole plane ride. The people sitting around us were amazed and my wife and I are grateful that we won't have to worry about air travel. Now on to the review of the resort: Arrival: The drive from the airport to the Honua Kai is about 45 minutes usually, but we hit traffic so it took closer to an hour. We knew this going into it. We made the stop at Costco where we bought too much for two people. We chose the Honua Kai based on recommendations on tripadvisor and our friends had stayed there last year. Drove up to the front entrance and dropped the car and luggage off at the valet. Stephen was great. He talked to us about his 2 month old daughter and told us he would have our luggage up at the room when we got there. The valet is included in the resort fee of $25 which is nice, especially when arriving or traveling with all the extras that a child needs. There is also underground parking that we used as well. Check-in was quick, the lobby and view was excellent, and we were off to our room. Room: We booked a partial ocean view 1 bedroom unit as part of our package deal on Orbitz. We figured with the 4 month old we would be spending more time than usual in the room so we wanted something to look at when we were there. We got the Honua tower room 538. It is on the north side and had views of the ocean/pools to the west, the grassy knoll/waterfall to the north, and mountains to the east. You have all the utensils you need, including glassware and plasticware for tropical drinks, wine, beer, and even martini glasses. The appliances were energy efficient which was nice since we had many dishes and dirty clothes to clean. The bathroom was spacious and reminded us of how small our one is at home. Overall, the room was perfect, like living in a modern loft apartment, but right on the beach. Grounds: The grounds were green and worked on daily. We spent most of the time at the pool. There are four pools, but we spent all of our time at the kid pool which has a pebbles that make it like a beach. It was great for our situation. We had bought a PeaPod to use with our son and he stayed in it while we were there. There were waterfalls to listen, watch, and cool off under, water fountains to entertain toddlers, and a small 1 1/2 foot deep pool in which we introduced our son to swimming in. We went on walks on the beach boardwalk that goes all the way down to black rock several times. In the afternoon we would hit happy hour at Dukes from 3-5pm for some $5 pupus and maitais and listen to live music. And in the evening we would cook our meals up at the room. We used the Viking grills on the grounds one night to BBQ our tri-tip. I also, woke several morning to go and work-out in the gym. It is small with 2 stationary bikes, 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical machine, and free weights. It is very warm in the room, but they do have a small floor air-conditioning unit that you can turn on which I highly suggest. Activities: Since we had a four month old in tow, we didn't do many activities. Our daily off site experience was going to Bad A** coffee down the road for an iced drink, and stopping at the Farmers Market which occurs on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the parking lot. There is a Times Market across the street that we used for groceries and would probably fit most two person needs. The cost wasn't much different than what we see back home, especially for sale items. We went on a whale watching expedition through Pacific Whale Foundation in Lahaina and saw many humpbacks up close and personal. Our son slept through the whole thing due to the rocking of the boat. If you get sea sick this might not be the trip for you. Before the trip we got a hawaiian snow at Local Boys which was just as I remembered. I would probably opt to not have the ice cream before the boat trip next time;) We also spent our last day in Lahaina walking around the shops and had lunch at Lahaina Grill before heading back to the airport. Usually we try to make a tropical trip once a year when the weather is gray and stormy. In the past this has been an all-inclusive. However, my wife is sold on Maui. It allowed us a top of the line condo, within walking distance to local places, with great pools and beaches, with attentive service without being overly attentive. All in all a paradise found for this family with a new son.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Springfield, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cI will be staying here again!\u201d", "Author": "MegTheMom", "ReviewID": "UR97842639", "Content": "My husband and I spent a week at Honua Kai in Maui. It was absolutely wonderful! The staff was friendly, the rooms were large (ours had a full kitchen and washer & dryer - I believe all of them do), and the grounds were beautiful! The hotel was at capacity while we were there, but it never felt crowded, whether in the hotel, at the pool, or on the beach. I have a few MINOR complaints about the hotel. First, there were several times we came to drop off or pick up our car and the valet wasn't there. This was simply and issue of being under-staffed. It only took us three days to realize it was a shorter walk to the parking garage (which was direct access from the elevator) than it was to the front of the hotel. Second, the concierge was difficult to get in contact with. Again, it was an issue of being under-staffed. There are two towers to the hotel, and the concierge had to split her time between them. Third, there was a $25/day resort fee we had to pay that we didn't know about. The fee payed for access to the fitness area, pool, and valet parking (we had to pay and additional $2 every time we got our car). I don't like hidden fees. Looking back, I wish we would have put up a stink and requested to not pay it. That being said, I would still go back to this hotel, fee included. The pool area had a very natural feel. It was surrounded by large \"rocks\" and waterfalls, and stretched through the property in the form of several long, skinny, meandering pools instead of one or two large pools. Because of this, there was a lot of pool side access, and finding the perfect place to lounge was never a problem. There is a slide going into one of the pools, but I never got around to using it. Maybe next time... There was easy access to the beach. There were no hotel-provided chairs on the beach. Most people sat directly on the sand, or on a blanket or towel. The sand was very soft, and perfect for building sand castles. The downfall to the beach was that there were rocks right off the shore in some places. It was fairly easy to see where the rocks were, and it didn't stop us from playing in the waves. We loved the location of our hotel. If you're looking for more local flavor, drive up Lower Honoapillani Road. It's lined with small hotels and condos, but also with tiny restaurants packed with native Hawaiians. Otherwise, head south on Hwy 30, to Lahaina. The entire town is one big tourist trap posing as a historical site, but it's a lot of fun.

We had a studio room, which is in the internal corner of the u-shaped building (we stayed in the newer of the two buildings - the Konea building). A great partial ocean view - it's well architected so that I imagine all units get to see the Pacific. Call outs: - Dukes is a good all round restaurant choice down by the beach for breakfast, lunch or dinner, but gets old after a while. You'll need a car to explore further afield - the boardwalk, walking south from the resort, is a great exercise option in the morning with amazing views and breaching whales before breakfast. About 3 miles round trip - there is a Time supermarket right opposite the resort. Really good for stocking up on either basics for the room, when (like us) you primarily eat out, or fully stocking the cupboards to make use of a very well equipped modern kitchen if you'd prefer to eat in. - breathe the sea air. Open up the glass doors fully between the room and the lanai to create a completely open air space. It makes a hug difference. - snorkeling is good from the beach at the resort, but slightly better about 500yds away at the Westin. Earlier in the day = calmer water generally. - you will not get bored of the humpback whales. Recommend a kayak & snorkel trip to get real up close and personal. Griff at www.mauikayaks.com was awesome from Olowalu. - it's a family friendly place with no real designated adult only area. While we weren't there with children neither were we particularly distracted by those of others - all got along well. - happy hour 3-5pm. Mai Tai's are the devil's work ;-) - no spa at the resort & spa as yet, however there is a gym which is well enough equipped, but hey - go run and swim in the great outdoors!

Our car was brought to us within 1 to 2 minutes and when we called for it before we left our room, our car was waiting for us with the air conditioner on high. The valet personal always addressed us by our name and wished us a good day. The beach is beautiful but you must read the signs. If you ignore any of the warnings, then you can not blame the resort. The waves were very large and it was hard to stand up at times. I would not allow a child to swim in the ocean at this location because of this. However, there are two nice size pools and a kiddy pool, pPlus 2 hot tubs.There are also shower poles where you can shower off sand before going into the pools or back to your room. There is a small store in the resort that carries sweet treats, salads and sandwiches that are made up. They also have a wide selection drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic. We ate at Dukes, the restaurant on the resort grounds and never had to have a reservation but if you can plan ahead, I'd recommend it. The only complaint we had was the choices on the room service menu. If you are looking for something simple at the end of a long day such as a sandwich or pizza, you won't find anything from room service. Also they did not post the prices which always is a concern. We stayed 8 days at the resort and the room service menu is the only thing that we would change...so we give the resort an A+ and we will visit again. Housekeeping cleans your room everyday. Our bed was always made and our coffee packets were replaced when we ran low. Our room had a full kitchen with a dish washer. I did not take the time to wash our coffee cups but when we came back, housekeeping had rinsed them out and put them in the dishwasher for us. We found a basket on our table with dish cloths, towels, dish soap, dishwasher soap, laundry soap and conditioner, and sponges. On top of the box was a nice note stating that this was a gift which we were able to bring home to remind us of our trip. The basket had a lid that was decorated in Hawaiian decor. The staff also delivered a bottle of wine to our room because we were celebrating our anniversary. We have nothing but great things to say about the resort. We loved the location of the resort.

The slides & pools we're fun, but between the beach thats right there & the pool we were constantly walking back & forth - so it was nice having such a nice beach close by! There is a nice boardwalk that goes pretty far, that me & my husband enjoyed many RUN's on, it does get pretty crowded so i would recommend going between 7-730am.. We ate at DUKES the restaurant onsite, and loved it - as everything in Hawaii, it was expensive tho.. The little cafe onsite was nice too & we enjoyed our morning Latte's & doughnuts, the cupcakes we're delish! Every employee was very nice & helpful! couldn't say a bad thing about the place! Our room was the FULL Ocean View 2 bdrm Villa, it was perfectly big enough for us 6 very nice rooms, kitchen great - but wouldn't pay the additional price for the full ocean view, as i didn't think it was worth the additional cost once we saw the view... We we're on the 2nd level & their palm trees blocked most of our view of the ocean (during whale season that kinda sucked).. Just wish Hawaii did \"ALL INCLUSIVE\" hotels like MEXICO, we hated spending so much money on food, but thats why you gotta go to the grocery store across the street & use their onsite BBQ Grills for dinners to save money!! There's even a subway & mcdonalds close by thats alot cheaper then most all restaurants! We did eat at a place called \"CHINA BOAT\" down the street, and LOVED IT, price wasn't bad either!

We got a better rate because of view, although ours was still fabulous. We were travelling with a group of 10 adults--many of which are picky and well seasoned travelers. We all absolutely LOVED Honua Kai. My husband, who tends to be frugal, has already agreed to let the two of us book a trip back next February. As to any complaints I 've read on the message board, (1) smell: we had no issue with smells from the nearby sewage plant and (2) what's included: the resort is ultimately a condominium unit with some units rented by individual owners, some rented through property management companies, and others rented by the resort itself. The units are pretty uniform in appearance but vary in amenities. For example, our unit including valet parking, daily maid service, and a supply of laundry/dishwashing detergent, no check-out cleaning fee, etc. The unit our friends stayed in did not include those amenities. Because of the various ways to rent, make sure you understand what you are getting in your price. Travelers shouldn't blame the resort for what they failed to read in their agreements; (3) Coral: there is coral in the ocean--as there is in many other local resorts. There is adequate warning of this on signs leading to the beach. Just wear beach shoes and you'll be fine. (4) Wireless Internet: we never had any issue with getting a strong signal anywhere in our unit. Our friends had no issues in their unit, either. There are three really large pools all with many chairs. It was not like a lot of resorts where you have to rush down to save a chair for the day. Duke's is great. We ate one night as a party of three. We had drinks, two appetizers and three nice entrees. Our tab was $125--cheaper than we could have had that meal on the mainland. They also serve food and drinks poolside. The service at the resort was outstanding. The valets, front desk and concierge were always friendly and willing to make suggestions on anything we asked. We were there during peak whale season. It was incredible to sit on the patio and watch the whales blowing and jumping. It was increadible the amount of whales in the channel between Maui, Lanai and Molokai (Honua looks across the water at Lania and Molokai).

Of course people never think the rules apply to them especially as they are drinking from their glass in front of the sign telling them not too.

Excellent value considering the cost of neighboring hotels. Great for families. Location: Honua Kai is located in the Lahaina area on the northern part of Kaanapali Beach, about a 40 minute drive from the main airport in Maui. In doing research it seemed like the 2 most popular areas in Maui were Lahaina and Wailea. Both areas are laden with resorts and hotels, however I felt that the better beaches were in the Lahaina area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Kaanapali Beach, Kapalua, which was my favorite and DT Fleming). The hotel is located about 10 minutes from Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village which is where a lot of the shops and restaurants are at (I highly recommend Lahaina Grill). Rooms: One thing to note: I thought I had booked a partial ocean view, but instead got a resort view. Definitely go with an ocean view. Resort view overlooked the front of the hotel (parking area + mountains). We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in our room, but it would have been nice to sit on the very spacious lanais and whale watch. Other than the view, the rooms were great. They are like little condos and have a dining area, kitchen, living room w/ flat screen, bedroom w/ flat screen, bathroom along with a washer and dryer, which was SO convenient. Hotel even provides detergent and dryer sheets. Furnishings seemed new, the design was nice and beds were comfortable. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d imagine a place like this would be great if you are travelling with kids. Also, all rooms have WIFI, which is included in the daily resort fee ($25). Amenities: Being a large resort, this hotel had 2 separate, pretty big pools.. one with a lazy river. It had a couple of nice hot tubs as well. It also had a grilling area by the pool for anyone who wanted to grill their own dinners. The hotel had a sizeable food shop where you can order breakfast/lunch or buy your own snacks and ingredients if you wanted to cook in your room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s kitchen. The store had everything from raw fish fillets you can grill, to fresh bread, cheeses, and alcohol. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gym, but it was nice. Hotel provides self-parking or valet parking, which is a service included in the resort fee. The only downside for me was that there was no room service at this hotel. Hotel has only one restaurant on its grounds called Duke. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s located by the beach.. food is ok.

Unit 616 was fantastic.\u201d", "Author": "MGoBlue99", "ReviewID": "UR95082463", "Content": "I'm a heavy travel researcher and once we decided we were going to Maui, I spent a while researching lodging all over the island. While we normally stay in hotels on vacations, we decided we wanted a condo for Maui. First of all, condos are much cheaper than hotels. And since we were going to be there for 6 nights, we didn't want to eat out every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Having a condo with a nice kitchen enables you to save some money while eating healthier. I researched condos in Lahaina and Wailea area. While both areas have plenty of condo options, we decided on Lahaina because we felt there was more to do there. I looked at dozens of condo complexes in West Maui and was dismayed that most of the buildings and units were old-looking. Yes, they did have beautiful views, but we wanted to stay in a condo that was luxurious inside and out. Then one day, I stumbled upon Honua Kai. And I knew I had found our home in Hawaii. The resort appeared to be good to be true- brand new, modern luxurious condos, and a nice location in West Maui. And the rates were very reasonable. We only looked at units that were available on vrbo.com, which provides direct rental through owners. You can go through a management company to book, but then you won't get to pick your specific condo. And going directly through the owner is much cheaper. After researching a bunch of units, we decided on Unit 616. This was a one bedroom, 750 sq foot, luxury condo with ocean views and mountain views. I booked directly with the owners- the Geng Family. The Gengs live right down the road from the Honua Kai and were terrific to deal with. The $200 nightly rate was a fantastic deal, especially compared to the hotels in Maui. The condo had a full-sized kitchen with granite countertops and stainless steel appliances. The living room had a big sofa and a dining table. The bedroom had a big comfortable bed and plenty of space for luggage. There were HDTVs in both the living room and bedroom. The bathroom was gigantic and had dual vanity sinks. The shower pressure was excellent too. There was also a washing machine and dryer, which means you can pack fewer clothes. The view from Unit 616 was gorgeous. There is halted construction next door, so yes, you will see some empty land and equipment. However, you have a sweeping view of both the ocean and the mountains. The lanai was a nice size and had a big dining table. It was great to have your morning 100% Kona coffee and read a book while staring out at the ocean. The other nice feature is that the entire glass wall to the lanai folds out. So you could open up the entire thing and have a terrific breeze coming into the living room (though we never did this because it was extra windy during our stay). Ok enough about the room- Honua Kai itself is a beautiful resort. The pools are amazing. There are 3 different ones and we spent time in each one. There is a water slide that is meant for kids but adults can ride on it too. There is a cascading waterfall that you can stand underneath, which is very refreshing. The resort is relatively new and everything looks clean and modern. On-site, there are two restaurants: Duke's, which is a full service restaurant, and a cafe. The cafe is pretty upscale actually and sells some fancy prepared foods. The location of Honua Kai is in the northern part of West Maui. There is a beach walk that you can use to go to the neighboring resorts. It's some good exercise to walk the trail. The resort is more isolated than the resorts further south, and therefore more quiet. Parking is via an underground garage (it is $10 a day). The resort felt very safe. The only thing I didn't love about Honua Kai is the beach/ocean right in front of the property. It is not swimmable due to the coral. You can go in a few feet but nobody goes deeper than that. You will have to go elsewhere to get in quality beach and ocean time (I highly recommend DT Fleming Beach, a few miles north of Honua Kai). Also, some have mentioned the odor from the nearby sewer plant. The only time we noticed this was during the drive when you leave the resort. We smelled no odor while on the resort. Overall, we thought the Honua Kai, and unit 616 in particular, were fantastic. Our week-long stay there provided us some amazing experiences and memories.

The deck was spacious and fabulous, with room for 4-6 people to sit and eat comfortably. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was large and luxurious. My only complaint about the room is very minor but significant to persons who care about their hair: the hotel provided a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner, as opposed to a separate shampoo and conditioner. I did not like the product and will bring my own products next time. We did smell the sewer smell from time to time. However, it was mild and fleeting and in no way would it affect my rating of the hotel or my decision of whether to return. The staff at the hotel were very friendly. The grounds were clean.

We have always stayed at the Whaler, but this time were looking for a condo with better ammenities that was more appealing to our your children. Honua Kai is the perfect mix.

The board walk extends to all of the Kaanapali resorts, allowing access to all the restaurants, beaches, and shopping areas in Kaanapali. We cooked most of our meals in the condo, bbq and grilled many of nights, and enjoyed Dukes for happy hour. The pools and grassy areas are truly amazing. My 5 yr old and 7 yr old spent many hours every day playing catch and tag in the grass, and swam all day in the pools. There are multiple pools all with a different vibe. Something for everyone.....there is a larger quiet pool for the adults,a kid area which has a lazy river, water slide, sandy bottom area, and caverns with waterfalls. Kids club was the topper for this vacation! While we had not intended to use it, our kids saw the activities and begged us to stay. We ended up dropping off our kids 2 hours each day so they could make arts/ cratfs, play games, teach us new Hawaiian words. I do recommend staying on the inside of the Honua Kai. We stayed in unit #237 and will definitely specifcally request that unit next time. It is truly a perfect unit. It is on the inside of the complex, but on the sunnyside where you can get your afternoon sunshine! I noticed the other side stays shady most of the day (not what I want in Hawaii!!!) Plus we saved money due to it being a partial ocean view, but when you walk out on the huge lanai, you have a wonderful view. Plus it has one of the largest lanais in the whole complex.

My wife and 1 year old son loved this resort for our first trip to Hawaii. When I started researching Maui, I quickly found the Honua Kai Resort and Spa in West Maui on the north end of Ka'anapali Beach (~10 min north of Lahaina, ~10 min south of Kapalua) This resort features two U-shaped buildings, one finished in 2008, the other finished in 2010. Within a half-day's worth of research (I was in a hurry), I booked a 9 day vacation through Orbitz. This resort has units managed through a \"hotel\" that you book through them, a website such as Orbitz, or a travel agent...and also has privately owned units that you can book through say, vrbo.com. I was amazed to see that this place averaged 4.5/5 stars by reviewers. I always look at reviews, and I have found that few hotels, restaurants, or anything for that matter gets such high reviews! It definitely lived up to the hype. Beautiful rooms. Great kitchens. So clean. The floor to ceiling retractable window doors out to your balcony are awesome! Booking through the \"hotel\" gets you daily housecleaning (plus a daily $25 resort fee). I'm not sure what the housecleaning situation is when you book through a private owner. Honua Kai has great landscaping. Beautiful west-facing beach in West Maui with awesome sunsets. Be aware of coral in many shallow areas of water, where many unaware guests lacerate their hands or feet. There are areas along the beach that are more predominately sandy in the shallow waters. Resort lies on the north end of a 2 mile beach board walk. The pools are wonderful. So much fun for kids. We stayed in January, and the water temperature for the pools and ocean was cool, but very comfortable. Tons of great restaurants in the area. Very convenient grocery store, across the street from the resort. We really enjoyed the ambiance and two-tiered menus of Duke's Restaurant, the dining room menu (entrees $25-35) and the grill menu (entrees $12-20). There was live music on some nights. The exercise room is one weakness. It only has 5 aerobic machines, some free weights, and a weight machine. I was still able to get in enjoyable workouts, but the weight room definitely only meets minimum standards. Another weakness, it should only be called Honua Kai Resort. At this point, they do not have a spa, but they can send you over to the neighboring Westin. Finally, the service is excellent. I found everyone to be so friendly and helpful.

Like my mom said, we were there for my wedding, which had the potential of being a disaster because of uncontrollable weather conditions. Being the OCD/Type A individual that I am, I freaked out and started looking for other indoor options. Dave M., at Honua Kai was absolutely amazing! He offered solutions for us, in case we had to have the wedding indoors and these options literally came less than two days before I was supposed to get married. He was patient and understanding while I tried to explain the situation in a \"spastic bride\" type of way. The next day when we were trying to have something that resembled a rehearsal in their lobby area, Dave offered to open up one of the business rooms so that we could talk about all the \"what ifs\" involved because of the weather. His customer service was refreshing and unparalled and I hope the Honua Kai realizes what an extraordinary asset they have in him. Generally, the customer service at Honua Kai was exceptional. Special thanks to Brent for ascertaining the problem with our refrigerator quickly and doing it all with a great attitude and smile! You rock! We started in a 2bdrm/2bath and they upgraded us to the 3bdrm/3bath which was absolutely amazing! My mom was right when she said all our family/friends ran through our room because it was sooo spacious and could accomodate so many of us. My mom cooked a full on breakfast brunch for 30 people in the kitchen! Now this kitchen deserves it's own paragraph. It is simply ridiculous (in a good way). I am an HGTV junkie, so I know a good kitchen when I see one. SS appliances, granite. Stone floors and all the applicances of home. I didnt want to leave. There was also a dining table that seated 8 as well as a bar area that seated 3 or 4. The bathrooms are spacious and huge, including the tub. The beds are completely heaven and very comfortable. The pools are absolutely great for adults and kids. They have a water slide, which my fiance (or husband now) loved! For our honeymoon, my husband and I stayed at the Ritz Kapalua. Although the Ritz upgrades us to a Residential Suite, I must say that after staying at the Honua Kai, I was a bit underwhelmed. The HK is just more modern and beautiful compared to the Ritz.. However because of the great customer service and the exquisite rooms at HK, I think anything else would have paled in comparison. Dont get me wrong, the Ritz is very nice, however when we return, we will stay at the HK because it is just nicer all around.

The rooms had flat paneled LED TV's in every room, and the bathrooms were to die for. The wireless free internet worked fine. They also have in room safe that are large enough to hold my laptop. The pools are huge, the beach is perfect, and you can watch the sunset each day. Everything is immaculate! Above all else, the restaurant on site, Dukes, is unbelievable! We stayed 4 nights and ate there 2 nights. We did not go to any other restaurants. No need to. Why drive? And we love dining out! One night, we saw Chris Berman (ESPN's, \"will he go ALL THE WAY\") hanging out at the bar. He has a place in Lahaina and goes to Duke's. The only negative for us, and we knew this when we booked our room, was that we did not have much of a view of the water. The two buildings are U shaped and most of the units in the U do not have much of a view. When we booked our room, we knew this, and it was a difficult decision because we always want/get a room with a bold view of the water. All things considered, it was worth the sacrifice, and if we go back, we'd stay here again, even without the bold view. I am writing this review today because I feel obligated to do so, as I use Tripadvisor a lot, I rely heavily on the reviews, and I feel an obligation to the other readers to do so. I hope all of you reciprocate too. I have just completed booking accommodations for our trip to Anguilla and St Martin in 6 weeks. I utilized tripadvisor extensively. While in the process of looking for accommodations in Anguilla and St martin, my wife and I said many times, \"we need to find a place like the Honua Kai\" The Honua Kai has set a new standard for us!", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cGreat Birthday Gift For the Blond\u201d", "Author": "genee333", "ReviewID": "UR93822091", "Content": "Booked this resort based on ratings.

When we arrived, it was raining extremely hard, this short of a hurricane and to make matters worse, rain was predicted for the entire week. We were exhausted from our travels and anxious about our outdoor wedding which had a high probability of being rained out. The Honua Kai was/is beautiful and has such a peaceful, calm feel to it. Just walking onto the grounds was therapeutic. The service is impeccable! Everyone we encountered was pleasant and professional. We were upgraded to a beautiful, 2 bedroom suite with an ocean view. Due to the wedding, I had family and friends coming through our suite most of the day and night. We were on storm watch, monitoring the weather hour by hour. At one point, my daughter had spoken to one of the managers at the Honua Kai (Dave?) regarding possibly switching the wedding to iinside one of the banquet rooms at the Honua Kai. This manager Dave was sympathetic to our plight and provided us with possible options in case we couldn't go through with the original plans at an affordable price. On Thursday, the day the wedding was suppose to take place, it was cancelled due to the storm, reschedule for Friday.The vendors couldn't get over to our side of the island due to closure of the main road. In addition, our refrigerator in our wonderful room wasn't keeping our food quite cold enough. Needless to say, the bride was crying, practically in a fetal position. Once again, the Honua Kai came to our rescue!!! Brent from engineering came up to assess our refrigerator, quickly diagnosed the problem and gave a recommendation to Bobbie in management that we should change rooms while he fixes the refrigerator. We were upgraded to an amazing, 3 bedroom, 3 bath, ocean front view suite! This room was not only beautiful, but functional as my wedding guest and family had a lot of room to move around in. On Friday, the morning of the weddng, all I could do was gasp at the mesmerizing view from the large lanai. There in front of me was the beautiful ocean, the pretty manicured grounds, and a bright sun!!!! Friday afternoon, in warm sunshine we had a beautiful, outdoor wedding!! I want to thank God and the Honua Kai for making this time in our life very special!! My family and friends have expressed many times throughout the trip on returning back to the Honua Kai this summer because we were so impressed with the service!!!

The Aina market in the lobby and the Times market a 5 minute walk away were more than sufficient for most of our grocery needs.

We stayed in a one bedroom suite with views of the west Maui mountains.

If you can, get a room with an ocean view, i am sure it is well worth it. The front desk, vallet, and cleaning staff were all excellent. Our room was clean and comfortable. Everything was nice and new. We loved having our own kitchen to cook meals in since we were traveling with our toddler who suffers from severe food allergies. On our way to the resort we stopped by Costco for food and to a couple of grocery stores nearby. The washer and dryer was really convenient when staying for an extended period. The resort was never too crowded. The various pools were lovely, which brings me to our only bad experience at the resort. While pool hopping with our toddler on our last evening in Maui, we were approached by security. We were told that babies were not allowed in the hot tub area, but during our entire stay our toddler and every other toddler staying at the place were in the hot tubs... ALL OF THEM! We were then asked \"Are you even guests at the resort?\". The fact was that we were targeted because we looked more \"local\" than the other guests. We left the pool area and did not talk to anyone at guest services, although I do regret that now. The bottom line is that although we enjoyed our stay on the most part, I dont know if i would stay again because of our experience in the pool.

I too have nothing but praise for Ted at the front desk. He was my 'Christmas miracle,' when we checked in very late Christmas day evening and decided we wanted another unit. He found us the last unit available in the complex, which turned out to be such a blessing. While the two bedroom has ample space for six, you would need to utilize the sofa sleeper, which my husband was not wild about. He likes everything neat and tidy at all times, and having someone on the pull out sleeper sofa meant that would throw the dynamics off. Thank goodness we were able to get a separate room for the girls, and everyone was happy! Thank you again Ted! The concierge Kimmy was very prompt and helpful, and always willing to look for whatever we inquired about. She suggested a whale watch with a company I didn't know a lot about (only because it isn't reviewed alot, but is well deserving of high marks) that was truly like something out of a National Geographic show. (I will review that later, but it was Captain Steve's Lanai Snorkel trip with Jonathon and Jeff, the only two I will ever go out with again!) so thank you Kimmy for that! We booked our unit through Unikta Vacations, and Nikta made sure every detail of our trip ran like clock work, not to mention that she is one of the nicest, more sincere people you will ever meet!

The property is gorgeous and situated on a beautiful beach in North Kanapaali. The condos/suites are brand new, have beautiful and spacious porches/patios, oversized bathrooms and very nice kitchens and living room areas. The bedrooms are a bit small (access to the closets are actually blocked by the entry doors) but, overall, these units are first rate. The amenities are fine, too. Duke's restaurant is much better than the old Duke's, there are tons of pools on the grounds (though the slide and lazy river are misnomers... unless you are under the age of 4!) and the fitness center is fine, for those who can't find enough to do outside. Here's the downside: the service is so bad it's comical. At check-in (for 2 ocean view suites at the most expensive rate of the year), we were met with a woman who tried to give us a downgraded room, spent most of the time explaining what we couldn't do, and then forgot to give us our \"towel passes\" without which you can't get a single pool towel! We were starving when we arrived so after checking in ordered 4 sandwiches in the Deli which, despite the efforts of the very pleasant crew working there, took 30 minutes for them to make during a slow time of day. After we went grocery shopping that evening, we pulled up to the front to see if we could get assistance or even just access to a dolly. The bellman proceeded to tell us they didn't have dollies(!), then \"stealthily\" put the 2 luggage dollies resting not more than 20 feet from us into a storage closet. But, there's more. We had a couple items of clothing dry cleaned, and they were returned a day late and only after we called the front desk to remind them we'd turned clothes in for cleaning 3 days earlier. We called the concierge to book a Luau at Royal Lahaina and spa appointments at the next door Westin (there are no Spa facilities at Honua Kai, but they advertise the Westin Spa as if they have an arrangement with it). No one called us back for, literally, hours following both requests for assistance. In fact, when the \"concierge\" did call back, we were already at the Westin, where the concierge there was kind enough to book a Luau for us while we used the Westin's Spa! And last, when one of my son's ripped his feet open on a reef outside the hotel, pool personnel called an in-house medic--who didn't even know to clean a wound before taping it up (thankfully, our oldest is beginning his surgical residency, and took over the process with supplies from a local supermarket once we realized that the medic wasn't trained for much more than a toddler's \"boo boo\"). The bottom line is: if you are self sufficient, like to book and generally take care of things yourself, yet want to be in a great location at a brand new facility, this is for you. But, if you are used to having some level of service component to your vacation, book a real hotel.

We booked directly through the resort on the phone which is the way to go I think. I hear that the others have problems because they get zero service. Intrawest owns some of the properties and manage others, but for those that book 3rd party they must rely on the 3rd party to take care of any issues or get any service. And the 3rd party is not on site nor is service their core business. Speaking to the staff they get a lot of flak from those that book through 3rd party but it's not their fault. I am assuming the owners have a choice to pay for Intrawest to manage them but choose not to. Therefore you get what you pay for. The service we received was very good throughout. They grabbed all of our luggage and the Costco shopping for us and brought it to the room and then gave us a tour, explanation of the appliances and the features which was a very nice touch. The rooms are gorgeous, kitchens modern and with every appliance you could need. Even the pots and pans are high quality. The washrooms are large and clean and the linen was of a very high quality. The rooms were cleaned very well everyday and they even did the dishes that we would sometimes leave out. They took out the garbage and our recycling. They had a bottle of champagne and two flutes waiting for us in the room (because of our wedding). Laundry detergent, coffee, and some other necessities were gifted. We would have really liked if they had salt, pepper and sugar as well. The lanai doors open up fully, there is a great accordion style screen door to keep the bugs out at night. The air condition works very well. The washer and dryer we were not used to and warned that because they are energy saving they take a lot longer, but it was a little ridiculous. It took hours to dry. My sister and parents got a 3 bedroom, and it was crazy how nice it was. Marble countertops and backsplash, Viking appliances (gas range), two stoves, wine fridge, washing sink on the island. I love cooking and for those that also love to cook these condos are very nice.

We were not disappointed...the resort is brand new. The suite was very modern with nice appliances, nicely furnished and a huge balcony. We stayed in Unit #924 which faces the mountains and the parking lot. We didn't care that much for the ocean view but it was a little bit noisy with the traffic on the Hwy, even in the evening. The Honua Kai has two towers with common grounds. There are 3 pools, a lazy river and a slide...all of that with the ocean steps away. The resort also has a decent gym, a kids activity room and an on-site market with local produce...and the ocean front Dukes Restaurant. The location is also great with a few restaurants closeby, Times Supergrocer across the street and Lahaina just 10 minutes away.

Overall, we loved it and would love to go back in the future....especially with our daughter being old enough to use the kids activity room on our next trip! *Family activity tip: The Sugar Cane train is a fun activity to do.

Cons: -LOTS of little kids. Obviously good or bad, depending on your viewpoint. The kids seemed to love the pools and the grounds. But for a couple on vacation like us, being around lots of kids can be tiring. Fortunately we were out and about nearly every day and didnt spend much time at the hotel anyways. -$25 \"resort fee\". Supposed to cover parking, internet, the room safe, use of the pools, etc. I think this is just nickel and diming you.

I cut myself a couple times. -the hotel was relatively empty when we were there. I'd say about 20% of the rooms were occupied. Made me wonder why.

The bell/valet and front desk staff were wonderful and we got an upgrade without even having to ask. The room was clean, comfortable, spacious and exactly as pictured. The kitchen was fully stocked with all gadgets, serveware, and appliances. It was really great to have all of those amenities in the room. We loved the accordion doors. It was very quiet in the room, but it appears that they are preparing for some major construction next to east tower. My husband once smelled the sewage smell, but I never did. We only got the maid service once (and only for a change of sheets/towels and trash removal), so I can't comment on that. Two things I did not like about the room, though: 1) no full length mirror...weird and 2) the bathroom was not accessible from the bedroom. The fitness center was barely adequate... only two treadmills, an elliptical, free weights, and a very basic universal weight machine. The grounds were beautiful and well kept. The pools were really great. We don't have kids and wanted some peace and quiet, which we got at both of the end pools. (The middle pool attracts the kids with the slide, sandy beach, and waterfall.) It was never crowded at the pool, we always had our choice of chaise lounges. We found the chaise lounges really uncomfortable (no padding) and there was no way to secure a towel, which was problematic due to the serious wind some days. I was also annoyed that they did not have any chairs or chaise lounges for the beach. For this type of resort, I would expect these amenities. I also found it outrageous that they charge $25/day for the padded 2-seat cabana (which I never saw one person use) especially since the resort was nowhere near full. The pool attendants were very friendly and nice. However, one day the slide attendant screamed at a little child (no more than 6 y.o.) so loudly and angrily that literally everyone at all three pool areas heard him. I think the child was sitting on the end of the slide, which is dangerous, but this guy was really out of line. The parents were understandably quite upset. We liked Duke's a lot... the staff were awesome and the food was very good and not as pricey as other hotel restaurants. The mai tais were great! One weird thing: they closed for an entire day for the staff holiday party. We were pretty irritated by this since it is the only bar/restaurant onsite. We didn't get anything from the market inside, although everything looked good and not outrageously priced ($10 for sandwich + chips, which is about what you'd pay at a sit-down restaurant). They also had frozen meals, wine, beer, liquor, and other groceries as well as some cute gift items. There is a supermarket right across the street which was pretty good. I was able to find many items for about the same price as at home... look for specials!

There are soooo many rules - and they're not afraid to give you warnings. Our big mistake was to leave a bathing suit over the back of a chair on our balcony over night. The horror of horrors!!! That warranted a warning note under our door the next morning. Want to bring a beer down from your room while you go to the pool? Nope - you'll be warned about that too.

We rented a privately owned studio room through Kaanapali Beach Rentals management company & our room was exactly as stated on the website. On the 8th floor, interior courtyard, great ocean view & pool view from our room. Studio room was a perfect size for two people & the full kitchen is great just for fixing simple breakfasts, snacks and light lunches even if you don't plan to do much cooking in general. Washer & dryer worked well and came in handy - dryers do take a long time to dry things though. Shower head was high enough for my tall husband and water pressure was great. Nice modern amenities/finishes throughout the room and bathroom. Decent bedding and comfortable bed and seating throughout the room. Underground parking was nice. We had wireless internet service that was only spotty a couple times. Lanai with door that opens completely was very nice to extend your living space. The grounds were immaculate and so beautiful. Tiki torches lit up everywhere at night added to the night time ambiance. We did find ashes on our lanai table one morning so someone above us was smoking one night but since it didn't happen again, we didn't bother reporting it - I'm pretty sure there is a no smoking policy even on their lanais. Duke's Beach House Restaurant was great the first night we ate there, was good for breakfast both times, and was just \"ok\" another night we were there. Overall, great restaurant and the ocean front setting and relaxed atmosphere was perfect. The little store/market in the lobby was great to pick up morning coffee or anything you might need that you don't feel like driving elsewhere for. The beach walk starts in front of Honua Kai and will continue all the way south to Black Rock - great for my early morning runs. I think it was between 2.6 and 3 miles round trip from Honua Kai to Black Rock maybe? Winds were pretty strong for three days, then died down completely for the final five days of our visit. Definitely enjoyed this area (less crowded) north of Black Rock over the crowds we witnessed at the resorts south of Black Rock. Lahaina is just a few short miles drive away. The water treatment plant/sewage smell everyone talks about? Well, we smelled it but never at the resort. It was no big deal to us though. We always smelled it while in the car on Hwy 30 right in front of several of the resorts on North Kaanapali beach & smelled it while walking on the beach walk between Honua Kai and the Westin Villas. Maybe depends on where your room is at as we didn't have any smell from our interior courtyard lanai or on the grounds or at Duke's.

We walked into the lobby of the Konea tower build our home for the next two weeks. There were gentle breazes flowing through and you could see the ocean from the lobby. We checked in and were in our suite in no time. We had booked a two bedroom two bath ocean view until and the pictures of the units on line don't do the real thing justice. Our suite was on the 5th floor and had a huge lani that ran the length of our unit. The kitchen had new Bosch appliances and the stove was so new it had never been used. Eatch bedroom had a master bath that was connected and had a large deap soaking tub and a stand up shower and marble floors and counter tops. The resort is really large and has 4 large swimming pools and several hot tubs and even a water slidge that I fell in love with ( it brought out the child in me). I was concered first when I saw comments about out of control children but I'm happy to report that I didn't find that. The beach is a few years away from the pools but it's not the best if you want to swim in the ocean since there is to much coral but there was a nice swimming beach about a 10 min walk down the path.

We were so sad to leave, as it was a fabulous family vacation, mostly due to the magnificent Honua Kai!!! Simply put, the resort is gorgeous and immaculately clean. Even after two weeks I was still awe struck with the beautiful grounds every time I wondered the resort. The variety of pools are great. We spent the majority of time at the lazy river pool. My 3 year old adored it! The hot tubs were lovely as well. The evening ambience of the resort is really enhanced by the torches lining the walkways. Dukes restaurant turned out to be our favorite restaurant to dine at after trying multiple restaurants in both lahaina and whalers village. So nice to have it on site for take out or eating lunch poolside! Prices are great too! The grocery store across the street is handy and is within easy walking distance. The resort is close enough to drive into lahaina or whalers at a moments notice, yet secluded enough to be quiet and relaxing. We never once had noise or disruptions around the resort. The sunsets were gorgeous from our 7th floor lanai, as were the many rainbows we saw day after day. Of note, we did notice the smell from the sanitation plant nearby, but not often and not for more than 5 mins at a time. No big deal at all. If the honua kai smells is, so do the other hotels nearby. Our suite was huge and the lanai was massive too! We loved beingr able to cook in our room in the well outfitted kitchen, as it can get tiring eating out in Maui everyday. Not a huge number of restaurants. We checked out a few other resorts while there including the westin, westin villas next door, Marriott villas, and the sheraton. NONE of them even came close to the honua Kai. The beach is the most beautiful golden sand and lots if it. The water is very pretty too. Didn't swim so can't comment on that, but others were swimming in it. The pools were so nice that we swam there all the time. The pools could be a tad warmer in my opinion. My only complaint is about the wind. There were days that were so windy you couldn't enjoy yourself outside at the Honua Kai. Drive up to whalers and the wind was nearly gone. Apparently is has to do with a funnel In between the mountains at that spot. Nonetheless, many days were hot without a breath of wind. I would return to Maui simply to stay a the Honua Kai again, and only would stay at the Honua Kai.

Smart layout of the pool and hot tub areas means that there are several pools and hot tubs spread out around the grounds instead of one large pool in the centre of the property. DISLIKES Spotty internet service. On our first two days we had to call a 24 hour help desk because the wireless and the wired access only worked when we were outside on the lanai. Also an in house technician was supposed to come up to check the connection in our suite but never did despite the fact we were told someone would come. $25 resort fee is a pain but I guess that is the industry practice now.

The hotel is fairly new... its spiel is that it is luxury condo real estate in a luxury resort setting. The resort itself is simple and clean - nothing ostentatious or lavish - yet beautiful. The grounds are well-maintained with beautiful gardens and pools. We stayed in a studio suite with a partial ocean view from our lanai, though our \"partial ocean view\" was semi-obstructed by Duke's restaurant. Our room was spacious and, most importantly, very clean with a large, fully-equipped kitchen with Bosch appliances and a spacious (but plain) bath. The best part about our room, however, were the folding Nana doors that opened up to a large lanai with a breakfast table, seats, and a lounger... the lanais really are a selling point. The Honua Kai sits right on North Kaanapali Beach and boasts a fabulous beach with beautiful views of the islands of Lanai and Molokai as well as beautiful sunsets. The beach is really what I appreciated most about this hotel. We must've visited Maui at a really good time because the weather was perfect and it was certainly not overcrowded on the beach, particularly in front of the Honua Kai. It seemed like we practically had the beautiful beach to ourselves at times! The only downside, for those of you who care, is that they did not have any beach cabanas nor have any beach service with just beach chairs and umbrellas. We were told by the concierge and front desk that they don't have a license to put out chairs or umbrellas on the beach. We ended up purchasing beach chairs across the street at Times Supermarket. (They do, however, have poolside cabanas). The service at the hotel is above par, though not excellent. The staff is friendly enough. The Wi-Fi worked on our Macbooks the first day, however, it stopped working on the second day. When my bf asked the front desk about it, they had us call a 24-hr IT service for troubleshooting. After nearly 30 minutes on the phone with the help-desk, they were not able to figure out why WiFi wasn't working and I had to use the internet cable. My bf's WiFi worked most of the time, but was also occasionally hit or miss and noticeably stronger when the lanai doors were wide open. Our room was also a little on the warm side at night even with the use of the AC at night, set at 65 deg, its lowest setting. So if you require a cool room to get a good night's rest, be forewarned. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a simple, laid-back, West Maui luxury resort with a beautiful beach without the crowds.", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cTop Notch Accomodations with Resort Amenities\u201d", "Author": "roxian", "ReviewID": "UR88690859", "Content": "We stayed here for 5 nights after 5 nights on Waikiki Beach. I chose the Honua Kai based on Trip Advisor reviews and pictures. After seraching on VRBO and other online booking sites, I called the HK directly and inquired about their rates. I was told they do rent some units through vrbo and the rate was slightly less. I was very happy with the rate quoted and received good suggestions regarding room types, views, and locations. I was also given a list of the actual room #'s that were available during my stay so I could choose the exact room. I stayed in a studio, #837 Hokulani Tower. Location: I used the maps provided in Maui Revealed to get to the Honua Kai without any problems. No wrong or missed turns. It only took about 40-45 minutes from the airport and is in a quieter area. Although not right on the main part of the beach (near Black Rock), we didn't mind the location at all. No problem. We had a car and drove around daily. Check-In/Check-out: It was very quiet when we arrived although we were told the occupancy was quite high. Valet greeted us and helped unload luggage while I checked in. Front desk staff very nice and helpful. Fast, concise check-in. Bell staff took us to our room and explained various aspects of the room, including the AC system and the folding lanai doors. I agree with others who dislike the $25 resort fees being charged by many resorts but I was aware of it going in. And although the Outrigger Reef in Waikiki did not charge a resort fee, which I appreciated, I still got hit with a $25/day parking fee. The $25 resort fee at the HK does include parking, self-park or valet. We opted for valet (why not? you are paying for it) and tipped them daily as they retrieved the car. The valet staff was so nice. On our way to dinner one night, before retrieveing the car, the staff suggested we needed our piture taken. It was the best picture of us on our entire trip. They were very friendly, fast, and full of suggestions. Check-out took a little longer as I had to wait on change. There is a small business room to the left of the front desk where you can print boarding passes. For some reason, I got checked into my airline and although I told it to \"print\" my boarding passes never printed (the printer was turned on). We needed to head out quickly to finish some last minute shopping on the way to the airport so I did not ask for help with this. I suspsect at some point later in the day someone received multiple copies of my boarding passes! Room: Exactly as seen in the pictures. Very nice. And thank goodness for the washer and dryer since something exploded in my luggage on the way from Honolulu. The room was nice sized for 2 people. The bed and pillows were great. We did have a problem with our AC the first day but it was fixed immediately. It shuts off when you open the lanai door and you have to restart it every time. I think we could have survived without any air conditioning at all anyway. The folding lanai doors are very nice and easy to use. The balcony has table, 4 chairs and a lounge chair. It did get HOT on the balcony as this unit is on the side that receives sun all day long. The kitchen supplied everything you would need. You can tell the rooms are practically brand newThe bathroom was nice with separate tub and shower. This particular unit (and I imagine all in this stack) has a larger bathroom sink/counter area than others. I was happy with the extra room for toiletries. The safe was in the owner's closet. It was not locked down, however, so someone could walk away with it if they wanted to. The view from the room was just as the pictures showed. We liked being on the higher floor. The elevators were always quick. You could hear some noise from below if anyway was being semi-loud down on the ground or out on their balcony. The u-shaped design of the buildings lends itself to some echoing. It was bad and I never heard anything when we had the balcony door shut. I never heard anything from other rooms or the hallway the entire time. Housekeeping: GREAT! Since we booked with the resort, daily housekeeping was included. This was supposed to be a minimal service daily with extra cleaning every 3rd (or 4th?) night. Well, we got a complete cleaning everyday, even doing the dishes for us. We did tip them a few dollars daily and it was well worth it. We asked for extra detergent/drier sheets on the first night and received it right away. One day they didn't even take their tip. Never had that happen before. They deserved for cleaning our dishes every day! Grounds: The grounds were immaculate. The pools were plentiful and gorgeous. We thought they were quite cool, it would be nice if they were heated. And if I had my way, I would remove the grassy courtyards and convert those areas to more pools, one flowing to the next with a swim-up bar maybe. Then it really would be perfect here! And I would suggest some music playing, lightly, around the pool area. It was windy with extreme winds a couple of times. It only lasted a short while but you had to hang on to everything. I noticed the smell once and wouldn't have paid any attention to it if it hadn't been mentioned on here. I was in the front of the building waiting on the valet when I noticed it. The beach is beautiful and if it is too rocky for you, move over a few feet. The lot next door is empty and next to that is a public access beach (before you get to the Westin). And the snorkeling in front of this area is great. We saw more coral (even spotted eagle rays) here than any other place we snorkeled in Maui. I do think they should include the beach chairs in the resort fee (as should all resorts). Small things like that are how you can keep repeat visitors and keep your resort sold out (although I'd like to keep it all to myself). We ate once at Duke's for lunch. It was good and we recieved a coupon for a free Hula pie when we checked-in. They did have live music in the evenings. Friday night it was packed. A lot of people had lawn chairs out next to Duke's listening to the music before sunset. We used the grills one night. There is a notice asking you not to linger in the grill area (no more than 30 minutes? I cannot remember the exact time). We thought it would be nice if they had an area to eat down by the grills but I understand why they don't want a lot of congregating. In summary, we had high expectations going in and the HK did not disappoint. I chose the resort and made all the arrangements with my travel partner going in blind. He was very impressed and happy with my choice of the Honua Kai. When we return to Maui we will stay here again.

One of the best features of the living room is the glass doors that open to the lanai. They are designed to fold back so you have total unobstructed access to the lanai. It was great because there was always a nice breeze. The kitchen was amazing with granite counters and high-end appliances plus a washer and dryer. Bathrooms have glass enclosed showers plus a separate deep soaking tube. The sink countertops are also granite. There were king-sized beds in each room. They were a little soft for me but our other family members loved them. Both bedrooms and the living room had big screen TVs. The property has a little gourmet deli/store that will deliver to your room. At the front of the property is Dukes restaurant. I didn't eat there so I can't tell you about the food. There is also a very cute childrens playroom with all kinds of activities. They do have a fee but well worth it. They also will have a spa but it was not open yet. Everything about the property is first-class. The staff is very friendly and the place is spectacular. The units are for sale but it is not a time-share. It is pretty pricey but they are running a special at 50% off the rate plus the 5th night free. That won't be forever but if you want a very special vacation then stay here.

A refreshing beverage from their fresh juice and smoothie bar is an imperative part of your afternoon visit to the pool. There were times when we would take drives up and down the coast to see just how good of a decision we had made with our chosen accommodation. In the end it was concluded that no superior alternative to the Honua Kai exists for miles and miles. As far as condos go, I felt that we had chosen the very best. Many of the hotels along the coast were dated and noticeably past their prime. I also was slightly put off by the touristy vibe emanating from certain areas of the island. It could have just been a slow week at our resort, but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel as saturated in touristy ignorance as in other areas nearby.

We all fit comfortably during the day , and used the pullout for the little ones at night. 301 has outstanding furnishings with all the amenities you would expect in this price range. Being on the end certainly added a nice amount of exclusivity, and made relaxing on the lanai quite pleasant with beautiful views of the water. The property has a very 'resort' feel to it. We have stayed at condos before (see my earlier reviews) and this property was much different. There is poolside service offered from Dukes, concierge service, tiki torches, and just general helpfulness at every turn. Oddly, there are no complimentary beach chairs. There is a stack of them at the edge of the property yet they are chained together. We were told that they were $10/day rentals. We never saw one used during our stay.

No ability to print boarding passes No spa (yet) Intermittent sewage smell New property = still getting the kinks out Overall, we were thrilled with this property and will stay here again. The Konea '01' stack is decadent and well worth the extra money. Note: 1. The courtyard area off the lobby's scream for a casual bar. Hopefully they will find somebody to open one. 2.

The great service started the minute I pulled up to check-in and never stopped. I was given the proper directions to the free underground self-parking. Check-in was seamless and I was even given an upgrade! When we opened the door to the room, our jaws dropped. This was larger than some people's apartments! The kitchen was gorgeous with Bosch appliances and granite countertops. There were 3 flat-screen TVs - one in the living room and one in each of the two bedrooms. This was a 2 BR/2 BA unit. The beds were very comfortable. There were ceiling fans in each room. There was also air-conditioning! That is hard to find in beach-front condos in Hawaii! The lanai was so large that it accomodated a dining table for 6 and 2 other chairs. When out on the lanai there was a nice view of the ocean. Looking straight ahead was an inner courtyard. The pool was further towards the ocean so this made it quieter than lots of other properties. We received calls from both the front desk and the concierge just a short-time after we settled in (a nice touch.) Everyone on the staff is friendly and helpful. Nice to have the parking, internet, and free local and toll-free calls included in the $25 resort fee. There is an organic bakery in the lobby which is quite well stocked. There are fitness centers in each tower (the one in the newer tower is nicer and better equipped). In the tower where we were, there was also a kids club and just by the pool was a Duke's restaurant and bar. We went down there almost every night and had a lava flow while watching the sunset. (we were in withdrawl over this when we got home!) I only had a few suggestions to make this perfect. The staff received them well and actually said two of the three were already being worked on. Wow. A place that really does care about the quality of the customer's stay. Just across the field there is a grocery store, a few restaurants and other things you may need. We do stock up at Costco on our way from the airport though. You can stay at a great property and still save on the provisions. They also have a computer with a printer down by the front desk so you can print out your boarding passes when it sadly comes time to leave!

The rooms are fantastic, so roomy and because the hotels brand new all the Bosch appliances are also brand new. We stayed in a 2-bedroom suite. The master was huge! These rooms are enormous! The amenities are also fantastic, there's a nice basket when you get there filled with soaps from Hawaii and you are allowed to take it with you when you go. Our balcony was a shared one and it was huge! Every morning we had lunch out there. We certainly saved on dining out by going to the grocery which is within walking distance and just cooking in the room.

We did the Costco and Safeway runs shortly after arriving. The unit is spectacular as we had a wrap around lanai that provided great sunset views. The windows are floor to ceiling and are a nanawall system that opens up the lanai completely to open up the living room. True Hawaii living with the outside coming inside. It almost doubles the living space. Beds, sofas and lanai furniture was all top notch and comfy. We did rent from a private party and not the hotel itself. The staff still treated us great and gave us a wristband at the pool. Speaking of the pools, they were great for our little 2.5 year old. He made all kinds of friends at the sandy bottom kids pool. Great thing is, most of the pools were 3-5 feet at most so it was easy to carry him around and catch him jumping in. The beaches were beautiful but not the best swimming beaches. I saw one guest get cut from coral after jumping in at sunset. It is a great walking beach and the sunsets there were awesome. We did some fun sandcastle building on the beach so it is fun near the shoreline and my son was able to run back and forth in the shallow waves. i snorkeled 3 mornings and found it great right in front of the hotel, but even better the more South you go towards Black Rock and in front of the Westin. We did eat at Dukes and its a great place for a sunset dinner. The food was really good, but Happy Hour was lacking in regards to the drink special selection. Not one Hawaii brewery on you Happy Hour list? I find that just not right for a place named after a Hawaiian icon. Even though we cooked and grilled (on Viking grills!) on property, We did get the chance to eat out. Suggest the Gazebo in Napili for breakfast and if youre a sushi fiend, you have to go to Sansei in either Kihei or Kapalua. Don't miss Aloha Mixed Plate too. Cheap local grinds and scenery to die for. Good happy hour starting at like 2pm with surprisingly great mai tais! Honua Kai is a short drive to Lahaina and Kaanapali, but far away enough form that hustle and bustle. The path in front allows you to walk (a long one!) all the way to Whalers Village and the south Kaanapali area.

There is not millions of staff roaming the property which would be overkill because the real treat about this property is that it is very resort-LIKE but condo comfortable. You can live as \"sloppy\" as you prefer on vacation and yet have access to high-end appliances to cook or clean or dishwash your own mess on your own timeline. The maid service won't do it for you so there is no surprise around this. You also don't lose mounds of tip money each day which would easily happen at a 5-star resort if staff had to take care of your every move. Our 3-year old enjoyed the Family Fun Club and was the only child that the morning while we went and surfed. A good deal for $30 if you ask us as he had the full attention of the child care manager. I would recommend a 1st floor courtyard facing room if you have toddlers like us. The Lanai-style opening doors really made it fun to watch our toddlers play on the patch of patio grass that comes with a first floor room while watching the other guests stroll by, and not have to worry about traveling daily via elevator. We loved this place - it was comfortable, clean, quiet, not in the heart of Kanaapali and Lanai and definitely not tore up like those high-traffic tourist spots.

We were pleasantly surprised by the beauty of this resort in person. We looked at other ratings on trip advisor and honestly were not disappointed by going in with such high expectations. First of all, the pics online do not do justice. Our room was only used once prior which was so great. We stayed in one bedroom suite with kitchen equipped with Bosch appliances. Even though you may not like to cook or buy groceries on vacations, you might change your mind! Maui is relatively expensive to eat out, not to mention mediocre food. The kitchen was spotless filled with every thing you would need: salad bowls, coffee maker, wine opener, dishwasher, washing machine and dryer. In addition, the linens were crisp, duvet and pillows very comfy. Our patio was overlooking one of the courtyards and made for romantic sunrise/sunset moments. It's located about 45 min from the airport and is quite accessible to the rest of island. You are minutes away from Front street ( big shopping area, night life and restaurants). The staff is friendly and helpful. The only thing that bothered us was the 25 usd per day fee which was added on to our bill ( ie . For towels, Internet, local calls, etc). I just felt that was a bit tacky to add on. It should have been in the original price. Also, their spa is not yet opened ( probably why they are only rated four stars instead of a deserving five!). You get a small discount by going over to the westin spa (5 min walk) which was quite good. Other than that, enjoy Maui by staying in this elegant, functional and romantic resort. Get here soon before more people find out about it . It truly is a hidden gem on paradise island.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marietta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGirls week at the beach - all you could want\u201d", "Author": "Delta3MM", "ReviewID": "UR81084910", "Content": "Our trip had 3 adult women and 3 college women. Our requirements were a 3 bedroom- 3 bath condo on the beach in the Kaanapali area. After lots of research, we selected the new Honua Kai complex - but it was out of our price range. So we waited until about 3 weeks before our arrival in off-season and started contacting owners and property managers. We got a great deal AND a great condo. We rented #201 in the Hokulani building. The condo is less than 2 years old and showed little sign of wear. The kitchen was well stocked - and we used it, cooking in 2 or 3 meals a day. The Viking gas cooktop was quite an experience. The oversized refrigerator held all of our fresh produce. And the wine cooler was useful for keeping the bear, water, and wine cool and at our finger tips. We moved the coffee pot onto the incredible wrap around lanai which overlooked both the pool (on the side) and the beach. This was definitely a beachfront condo. We would stumble out to the lanai each morning. Sip our Kona coffee and watch the surf, people, and wildlife jog by. Early after sunrise, the rainbows were stunning. Nearby are neighborhood fish stores, open air produce markets, and a grocery. We bought fresh fish and local produce. Grilled them on the lanai on the Viking outdoor gas grill. The outdoor kitchen was well used all week long. The ONLY complaint is the lovely Maui wind that strengthens after sunset. The bedrooms and baths were large and luxurious. Well stocked with towles including beach towels. We used the stacked Bosch washer/dryer all week. There was no maid service but we didn't miss it. The complex has a property management company - and really wants you to rent thru their service. If you don't rent thru them, there are some limitations to services. The valet parking and pool-side linens are not offred to \"3rd party renters\". That was us. We did pay an additional $10 / night for self parking in an underground, secured deck with an elevator right up to our unit. There was no need for valet service. And we didn't need the pool-side linens as we had our own beach towels provided in the condo. The other service that was restricted was free internet to outside renters. Our unit included free wi-fi and it worked effortlessly. We were told that only one of the fitness centers was open for 3rd party renters but we didn't test it. Your condo key was supposed to open the fitness door. Overall, we loved the location, the amenities, the luxury, and the quiet. This complex hasn't yet been \"found\" and doesn't have a recurring set of regulars. I regretted the attitude to 3rd party renters - they should be focused on getting the complex popular regardless of the source!! Market share!! But after arrival, it was actually something we laughed at and ignored. We highly recommend Honua Kai if you're self sufficient yet want luxurious surroundings.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cDeserted Island\u201d", "Author": "hallfarr", "ReviewID": "UR81081707", "Content": "We were on the 3rd floor on the inside of the 'original' bldg (2b/2b) with a beautiful view of the ocean as well as pool and Duke's.

On past trips to Maui, we've stayed up the road at the Ritz Carlton, or Four Seasons in Wailea. Coming from those 2 properties, we had high expectations for HK. Instead of paying $400-500 for a standard room at the Ritz, or FS, we got a beautiful 2 BR with lanai at HK, which was exactly what we needed. The pools, common areas, rooms are all up to par with the other 2 hotels mentioned. The service isn't bad, but since it's not primarily a full-service hotel, you're a little more \"on your own\" in terms of getting your own pool towels, setting it on a chair, or cleaning up your condo day-to-day. On the flip side, you now have a huge condo with a full kitchen and nice balcony, so it worked well for us. The restaurant, Duke's is great, but not for 7 nights in a row, so we went to some other local places, all about 5 min away. Duke's does offer poolside service for food & drinks, so this was wonderful and convenient! HK is perfect for families with small children, but I think honeymooners, or families with teenage kids would find it a little boring and lacking some of the \"busy-ness\" of a larger 5-star resort. I guess all things being equal, we would love to have a $1000 suite at the FS or Ritz, or 2 joining rooms (again, about $1000/nt) instead of HK, but for less than 1/2 of the price, this is a WONDERFUL alternative and I did not feel anything was really missing. I did not feel that spending more than twice the amount for equal accomodations at the Ritz or FS would have made our vacation \"twice\" as good, so I would recommend HK for families with small kids in lieu of the luxury hotels.

We (extended family of 9) reserved this as part of a package via AAA. 1) Location: North Kanapali Beach. 10 min drive to Lahaina. This area is very windy and this year apparently has been windier than usual. Close to everything but not walking distance. 2) Buildings are new and well kept. There are two of them called H and K.This is really not a resort in the full sense. It is more of a condo-residence with some amenities of a hotel. There is front desk and a valet/bell and a minimarket in the building. But not a full service resort which was fine by us. 3) The entire place and even the pools were never busy/crowded. There was never a problem finding chairs by pool. We even met a family who moved out of Westin b/c of overcrowdedness. There is one pool that is not as big as some megapools you see at major resorts but was good for kids since it ranged from 3-4 feet at most. There were other minipools and some waterfalls etc spread further in the grounds between the two buildings. So there was never a problem of overcrowding. 4) Because of the building's design, most rooms face each other across a wide garden area with views of ocean from the balcony. The closer you were to the ocean, the more ocean you saw. Only certain units have uninterrupted views from inside. 5) we had rented via Honua Kai itself via AAA Travel as part of package. So our units came with housekeeping BUT in contrast to hotel style housekeeping, it was very limited at Honua Kai. They only tidied beds and took garbage out. Linens were changed every 3 days. No real cleaning such as vacuuming or wiping the counters in bathrooms or any adiditional cleaning. They are upfront about it. So that was a let down. A 5$ tip per day helped a bit but it was not spotless as you'd expect. (quirk 1) 6) Kitchens in the units are fully equipped with high end Bosch appliances which require a college degree to figure out the details. Plates and silverware and othe knickknacks were available too. Oddly enough, if you ran out of coffee: it would not get replaced for free. $5 charge (quirk 2) 7) Staff very friendly. Concierge, as with other places, lose interest in you if you are not buying something from them. (quirk 3) 8) Extra $25 per day for resort fee which covered discounted pool/beach equipment; wifi; parking etc. You'd think they won't charge that in this economy to promote a new hotel but they did. (quirk 4) 9) last quirk was that eventhough we had requested nearby rooms, they did not pre-arrange that (in contrast to our experience at Hilton Royal Palms in Myrtle Beach) Overall, I would have rated this place a 5 had it not been for these small but definitely annoying quirks.

We truly can't wait to go back. We stayed in #742 (rented through VRBO - Jacki Motto and got a great deal) which is a 2 bedroom, 1 bath. The 2nd bedroom is technically a den but with doors enclosing it which worked great for our teen. The living room has a sofa sleeper which was used by our 3 year old and it was actually rather comfy. The main bedroom had a king size bed which was super comfortable and the pillows were awesome! The kitchen was fully stocked and we even cooked a few times. The kitchen/fridge was very helpful to have with children. The bathroom was AMAZING -- separate bath/shower, double sink, super large, etc. I loved having a washer and dryer in the room. The balcony was large and spacious with a large table to eat on and lounge chairs. The view from the balcony was just amazing. To your left, an amazing view of the beach and to your right a great view of the mountains; we saw rainbows daily on the mountain side. Just amazing! We ate at Duke's a number of times and their food inside is better than outside (when you go you will understand what I mean - can't remember what exactly they call it). Their mixed drinks were okay, could have been a bit stronger but they were acceptable. It's great that Duke's has pool service during the day too! When we were at the condo, it was definitely not at capacity. This made our stay super pleasant; no overcrowding like the condos just down the road that we saw on our walks. So I want to address a few things that I've read in previous reviews. First, the smell from the sewage plant. We were on the property for 7 nights and not once did we smell anything while on the property. As we drove out to the main highway, it did smell funky but NEVER while on property. We hung out at the pools and beaches daily and never smelled anything. Granted, it was windy so that may have helped push the smell elsewhere but I can attest to the fact that we never smelled anything while on property. Secondly, I read something about the property being dirty. No way! This place was immaculate. I saw people cleaning windows, vacuuming, fluffing pillows, etc. and never saw one piece of trash on the ground anywhere. They have an amazing pond with koi fish that my 3 year old loved. Lastly, the cleaning service / daily maid. If you rent from a private owner you will not get this daily maid service. Be aware of where you are renting from so that you know what to expect. You will get your maid service if you rent directly from HK and not from an individual or property management company. If you rent directly from HK you will pay a premium and you will get your maid service. We paid hundreds of dollars less by renting from an individual and I dealt with no maid service (not a big deal since we are rather clean people anyway). Yes, the front desk is for those that rent directly from HK but I felt we were treated no differently by anyone on property. Any issues I had I was asked to deal directly with the property manager that introduced to me upon check in. Bottom line, if you want to save $$ and I mean big $$$ rent from VRBO or a property management company. Our contract was clear on what we got and what we didn't get. I have to add the pools were AMAZING! We loved the water slide and the lazy river as well as the kids section of the pool. We had the most beautiful time in Maui and this condo complex completely impressed our family. We can't wait to go back.

It has many good aspects but even more problematic ones. Firstly, it is marketed as a luxury resort property but it is in fact a condo complex. It doesn't offer the amenities of a resort and definitely doesn't have the feel of a resort. It felt more like a newer airport hotel (i.e. Hampton Inn, Holiday Inn Express) in that yes there is a fitness center, multiple pools, a restaurant, etc, but they bear little resemblance to what you see on the website and they're not on par with what you would find at a true luxury property. This property is strictly a do it yourself place. The fitness center is very small and not staffed, there are unending numbers of pools, tiled with beautiful glass mosaic tiles, but they are falling into disrepair quickly (many tiles missing, very filthy water and bugs galore floating in the hot tubs). The major reason this hotel is not meeting it's potential is due to management in my opinion. The place is gorgeous at first glance because everything is new, yet the signs of deterioration are evident everywhere. The grounds are lush and sprawling, but there is garbage floating around all over, and the pools, common areas and rooms are dirty. After a six night stay in a one bedroom ocean view suite, this is what we came away with: Room: The best part of this property. The room was well laid out and appointed.

Small washer & dryer and full sized fridge and dishwasher. Hotel provides powdered dishwashing & laundry detergent daily. Doing laundry is a bit of a hassle because the detergent and the machines do not work well. We had to wash some items multiple times to get them clean and the dryers are impossible, taking as many as 4 cycles to get items dry.

Separate shower and tub and double sinks in the spacious bathroom. Rooms are not well lit however and the bathroom gets no natural light. Our particular unit had very dirty carpet. There are blu ray players in the rooms but there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no dvd library at the hotel, you can rent from the Red Box at Times grocery one block away. Ocean view rooms actually look directly at other units, the ocean view is actually just a partial one. Because the units are dimly lit it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to see into other units so the privacy is maintained in spite of this. We paid 63$/ night to upgrade from a resort view to so called ocean view. Resort view is of the west Maui mountains and is nice during the day, but at night (when you are more likely to be on your balcony) all you can see is the parking lot/ highway. The balconies are large and a great place to relax in the evenings, complete with screens hat span the length of the unit. Amenities: A very overpriced \u00e2\u20ac\u0153gourmet market\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is located in the lobby. It actually does have a great range of stuff so if you check in late as we did you can at least stock up on what you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need for the night. You can also order sandwiches & small snacks there. They have a very full selection of wines & beer. Be aware that you will pay 3-6 dollars for bottled drinks that are 1-2 $ at the grocery store. They have a wide variety of sundries so if you have no problem paying more than you can find everything you need there. For example, we saw they had swim diapers in all sizes for 22$- we bought ours locally for 14$. We bought combs, hydrogen peroxide & band-aids, and tin drink bottles there. Fitness center is lacking as described above. Restaurant is great as far as food & ambiance, and the only place you will find decent service within the resort. Tiki torches surround it and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the focal point of the resort at nighttime. Ample seating but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very busy. Hard to get a reservation but easy to get in as a walk in. It seems to function independently from the hotel. Internet is fast and included in the 25$ a day additional resort fee. Good self parking with the use of your room key. Underground and outdoor lots available. Location: On the northern part of Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali Beach. It would be more convenient to stay somewhere more central in my opinion. Good supermarket one block west. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s very windy here and the lobby creates a crazy wind tunnel. This is annoying if you want to eat or read outside, but enjoyable if you are out in the hot sun. There is a walkway you can follow that will take you all the way to Whaler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Village. Someone on here stated that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a 20 min walk, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say only if you jog it. I walked it with my son, who, granted is under 3, but it took us an hour. We took the bus back. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 1$ per person, and lets you off one block west of the resort so you have to backtrack, it took 5-10 mins walking with my son to get back from the bus stop. Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122anapali itself is pretty old school. Lahaina is interesting at nighttime. Next time I would rather stay in Wailea. Kids particulars: The pools are great for kids of all ages. Very difficult to find programming on tv for young kids. There are windows that open in the bedrooms that are at toddler eye level and are of some concern. We noticed a room called the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcfamily fun club\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 which was not explained to us and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ever see anyone come or go from there, nor did we formally check it out. The beach isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t great for little ones, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bit too wavy & deep and full of coral. The beach near the Sheraton is much better. Pools: Heated and lots to choose from, most from 3-4 ft in depth with 2-3 areas that are toddler friendly/very shallow. Kept at a perfect temperature, you get relief from the sun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s heat but it never feels cold. At least 3 hot tubs, all are quite dirty. Ample seating, there is never a fight for lounge chairs. If you want the covered seats you have to pay for it. The loungers are also all very noticeably stained with suntan lotion. There are 2 towel cabanas where you exchange towel cards for towels daily, they also sell water wings & floaties and suntan lotion, sunglasses etc. The signage says the pool hours are from 6 am -10 pm but we were asked to leave when we tried to go in the pool at 7 am, and told that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open until 8 am. The children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool area is marketed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sand bottomed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd pool but the floor is actually covered in rocks and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a little tender on the feet. Service: This is the biggest problem with this property. We arrived an hour early (3 pm) to check in and were told our room wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready. We were told we would be called on our cell phone when it was ready. We returned at 8 pm without having been called, and were escorted to the wrong room. We were traveling with our 2 year old son and had reserved a one bedroom butwere given a hotel style room without a separate bedroom. We then had to wait for a new room to be readied. We ended up switching rooms one more time, the next day and the room we settled in was a very noticeably smaller than our first (second) room. I called the front desk to inquire and they vaguely said that the room sizes vary within the same category from 700 to 920 square feet, and our new one was only 700. That is a huge difference so I suggest finding out the specifics when you book. The staff here are mostly hesitant to resolve issues., you will have to figure it out on your own. Housekeeping is NON EXISTANT. I want to emphasize that during our weeklong stay stay, our room was not cleaned even one time. We called several times to have the room cleaned and were always met with indifference. They would occasionally leave more detergent in our room and bags to change our own garbage. We even left a note one day specifically asking if we could have our counters and tables wiped down and our carpets vacuumed but found the note gone and nothing had been done when we returned after a long day out. You must do everything for yourself at this place so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mistake it for a hotel and expect to be served at any time. No pool attendants, long waits at the understaffed front desk, etc. Nothing is executed well or promptly. All of the phone extensions are hard to get through to, we were met with many, many answering machines, from the restaurant, to housekeeping to the front desk to the concierge. The concierge was extremely helpful when they were actually present. Grounds: Large, but very dirty. This was a big disappointment. The common spaces and hallways and elevators are filthy, the walls are scratched and stained and the carpets are unacceptable. Everything got filthier as the week went on and I saw garbage and mess accumulate in places over the week and it was never removed. This place is so new it should be in much better shape than it is. Overall I would not return and cannot recommend this property just based on value. For the price (and we usually stay at places that are double the price of this place) there just isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t enough substance.", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat place.

Walking distance to good shopping for the condo (i.e. food). Probably the only real complaint, would be the beach. Fairly steep drop off and decent size waves during our visit.

The service, from the minute we walked in the door, was friendly and welcoming. And genuinely friendly and welcoming. The Honua Kai is new, 7-stories, and has the features of a hotel and the rooms of a condo.

The hotel is quiet, and there are 3 pools with a slide. Also, the grounds are extremely well-kept.

However, if superior service is a major consideration for you, one of the more established resorts on Maui might prove to be a better option. We did a lot of research for our trip and selected the Honua Kai based on reviews, photos and value. We rented our unit 423 through an off-site property manager (Kaanapali Beach Rentals) instead of directly through the resort which did result in a great price, but also in a lack of service. We loved the room and the view, but we had an issue with the guests in the unit below us smoking on their patio during our weeklong stay. (They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even attempt to hide it and could be easily seen from the courtyard as they were only on the third floor.) Unfortunately, we couldn't enjoy our own patio at times and--even worse--had to close our sliding doors to avoid the smell coming into our room when the smokers were out. Now, we're not prudes when it comes to smoking, but since the resort is billed as \"smoke-free\" we really didn't expect to have to deal with the problem daily. (It was especially bad in the mornings when we wanted to either sleep in with the windows open or sit on the patio and enjoy our coffee. The smoking started daily at about 6:30 a.m.) Although the staff at the front desk initially told us they'd take care of the issue, nothing ever changed during our stay. Once, our call was transferred to \"Security\" but our message was never returned. Another time we called the front desk we were told that they couldn't help us because we didn't rent our unit through the resort directly. Huh?? The property manager we rented through was also of no help--they said they'd speak to the guest, but either they never did so or they were ignored. We were very disappointed in the response from both the resort and the property manager and consequently will reconsider staying at the Honua Kai in the future. That being said, the positive features of the resort marginally outweighed the lack of service regarding the smoking issue. The pools, Dukes restaurant and on-site market made the Honua Kai a definite cut above the standard Maui condo rentals in the price range. One note about the sewage smell mentioned in other reviews--we did not find it to be a problem at all. We were in a courtyard-facing room and never once experienced the smell in our room. However, we did smell sewage at times during our travels through Maui in general--but nothing specific to the Honua Kai.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Port Orchard, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful property - do not book through Maui Vacations.com or Chase 'n Rainbows\u201d", "Author": "Annielovesboats", "ReviewID": "UR74062874", "Content": "This is a gorgeous property, and the rooms are exquisite. However, if your room is in the even-numbered teens, such as ours was (218), your \"partial ocean view with view of the 'beautiful' grounds'\" will include a large dirty, dusty construction site, complete with orange barricades, bulldozers, trucks kicking up dust (which will cover your lanai furniture).

We rented direct from an owner on VRBO and stayed in a 2 bedroom 2 bath inside corner unit #539.

I would highly recommend them as the ocean view was far better in person than any of the pics posted and the lanai's are over 300 sq. ft. We were in the Konea Tower and while it was only about 1/3 full at any given time, we enjoyed the less crowded feel and ease of access to the pools and other amenaties. The units are off the chart as far as cleanliness, newness and the high quality of everything used in their construction. We have been to Maui a number of times and our jaws dropped when we walked in, it is head and shoulders above anything in it's price range or above it's price range as well. The pools were very nice and never over crowded, plenty of chairs and cabanas available just about any time of the day and there were plenty of hot tubs scattered thru out the 3 pools. Our condo was stocked with snorkel gear, boogie boards, beach chairs, games, coolers, beach bags, pretty much anything you could need for a day at the beach. The parking garage is $10 a day and we parked right next to the elevator that went straight up to our unit, so it was very well thought out as well as very secure with card key access. The beach out front is very nice and not crowded at all, decent snorkeling and boogie boarding though we liked nearby D. T. Fleming beach best for boogie boarding and next door to it was Honulua beach for great snorkeling. We walked each morning on the boardwalk down to black rock which was a nice 3 miles round trip. Duke's was about a 1 minute walk from our door and we loved having breakfast there almost every morning and several dinners there as well. Never had anything but good service and great food.

We stayed in July for 10 days. Our party of four consisted of DH, DS(19), DD(16). We had been to Maui before and stayed in Kaanapali Beach. I was worried about staying in North Kaanapali but it turns out that the beach is less crowded, has more sand and the snokeling is better than at Black Rock. We loved the area. The Honua Kai is located in a section that seems to have more condos. You have the Westin Villas to one side and another complex on the other side. The two towers are closer to each other than I thought, the pools area actually joins them. There is a supermarket called Times just outside the gates of the parking lot. We had done shopping at Safeway on the way in from the airport but found that the Times had better prices. This was a great place for lunch because they had fresh sushi and sandwiches daily. Our Unit was a 2-bedroom unit on the 5th Floor of the Konea Tower. We were in the inner courtyard and had a spectacular view of the ocean, pool and the inner courtyard just underneath our balcony. The view was spectacular. I had stressed over the room location and had even switched rooms twice but once you are at the resort you realize that the place is beautiful and every view has something to offer. I would even say that the mountain parking lot views were striking. The only downside would be at night, since the front of the hotel and obviously the mountains are not lit. The inner courtyard rooms had lovely night time views of the lit pools and tiki torches surrounding the pool area. Our unit was furnished like any luxury unit. Beautiful furnishings and impeccably clean. We rented from an Owner and did not opt for the daily housekeeping. We did not need it at all. We had a vacuum in the unit and the place was immaculate to begin with. We loved Honua Kai so much that when we return we will be returning there. It was peaceful, beautiful and luxurious. Here are my top 5 recommendations: #1 Stay at Honua Kai- wonderful place for families that need the extra room #2 Shop at Times-best prices #3 Eat at Dukes-good views and good food #4 Eat at Leilanis- Best meal we had. Better than Hula Grill #5 Do a Luau- We did the one at the Hyatt because Royal Lahaina was booked and the Hyatt Luau was great. Book it early #6 Do the Road to Hana and be sure to leave early so you can enjoy all the stops. #7 Enjoy the Pineapples- they were supersweet! #8 Explore the whole Island- It is a safe and lovely island to explore #9 Watch the sunset. The sunset from the Honua Kai beach is spectacular. #10 Be warned that the walk from the Honua Kai to Whalers Village on the beachwalk will take you 50 minutes.

BOOKING TIPS booking here can be a bit confusing, and it might be helpful for prospective guests to know that the suites fall into one of three categories. - owned and managed by Honua Kai (high standards and full service, but they seem to offer fewest deals) - owned by a private owner and managed by Honua Kai (high standards/service and good deals) - owned by a private owner and managed by a private owner or other manager (some have high standards but others don't seem to, but you may find best deals here) many of the other reviews said the deals were to be found via VRBO, so that's where I looked. but there was some risk, because some of the non-Honua Kai managed properties didn't appear to have the same standard of furnishings and decor. i ended up calling about 10 different places and ended up booking a privately-owned suite through Honua Kai and got a good deal for a great ocean front suite. also make sure you ask for a map of where the suite is situated - one property manager said we were getting an oceanfront suite, but on the map, it was clearly on the side of the building and she said, \"well, if you go out on the patio and put your head around the corner, then you can see the ocean!\" that might qualify for oceanview, but not oceanfront! PROS we traveled with 3 families and stayed in a 3BR suite. we were all very happy when we swung open the doors to suite #729. to my relief, it looked exactly as the hotel photos pictured, down to the sheets, dining table and sofas. it was very spacious and well appointed and they didn't spare any expense when building this resort. the retracting glass doors/wall wow-ed everyone in our party. the AV was wired in every room so we could play our iPod music in every room if we wanted to. the details like the Hawaiian Soap Factory laundry detergent was awesome. the pools were fabulous and the beach was great. there's a different pool to suit everyone's needs. we loved the stroll up and down the coast and ended up using the beach in front of the Westin resort more often than the Honua Kai beach because the kids could see gorgeous fish from the shallow waters without even snorkeling - unlike in front of Honua Kai during our stay. we also noticed that the Westin was much more crowded than Honua Kai and we felt fortunate (also obvious from the 70% - 80% empty parking lot). Duke's and Aina's Market are great, if not a little overpriced, but isn't everything on the island? the location is also a short drive to Whalers Cove where there are a few nice waterfront restaurants. CONS the place feels a bit sterile. it lacks character and if it weren't for the gorgeous ocean view and location, you'd be hard-pressed to know you were in Hawaii at all. we poked our heads into the Hawaiian-owned hotel nearby, the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, and that place, in contrast, exuded Hawaii, with women making leis in the lobby, though it might not be as modern and luxurious as Honua Kai. the staff seem new and inexperienced. when we arrived, there was no valet to take our car or take our bags. a member of our party needed to fax something out and receive a FedEx package and that was very difficult. another member of our party asked the concierge for dining recommendations and all she knew was Dukes, the on-site restaurant. the whole towelcard system is really annoying. it's not fun to have to keep track of everyone's towels when you're on vacation. at one point, we turned in our 4 towel cards for 4 towels to use by the pool. my husband returned to the room with 1 towel while i was in the water. i went back to our chaises and all our towels were gone. i assumed he had taken all 4 of them, but he hadn't. when i went to the front desk to ask for more towel cards, they wanted to charge me $25 for each one. i explained and the woman said she'd do us the favor of giving us more towel cards, but \"only this one time.\"", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Marshalltown, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "lrm44", "ReviewID": "UR71287213", "Content": "Honua Kai gives the best of a resort with condo living.

Traveling with me was my husband, our 6YO and my MIL. We had a 2 BR oceanview in the Hokulani tower. Our unit was managed by the hotel (Intrawest) and we booked directly through the hotel. As such, we did receive daily maid service -- new towels, beds made, vacuuming, dishwasher loaded, etc. One of the reasons I sought out renting directly through the hotel was for the daily maid service, which we did get. Also, the hotel was in fact negotiable on the rate (they have to check with the owner first), so just ask. The resort, the unit, the grounds, the pools -- everything was immaculate. This resort is absolutely stunningly gorgeous. Our unit was very clean, our beds were very comfortable, and this unit had everything we needed in it. There was a stackable, front loading washer/dryer in the unit tucked away in it's own utility closet. It's not quite a full size machine, but it did handle decent sized loads and the hotel supplied us with detergent. The kitchen was fully stocked with glassware, dishes, utensils and gadgets. There was a toaster, a blender, a coffee maker (for which the hotel gave us 2 bags of Kona coffee, filters, sugar packets and instant creamers), all of the appliances were stainless steel high end appliances. The dishwasher (detergent was also supplied by the hotel) was the quietest one I've ever heard and I now have dishwasher envy. Our unit was a corner unit on an upper floor. The lanai was L shaped and wrapped around the living room. We had an amazing view of the ocean from it. While it wasn't classified as an oceanfront room, it most definitely was. The lanai was fully furnished with 3 chairs with ottomons and a large table with 4 chairs. We spent a good deal of time on our lanai enjoying the view. Also, the doors fold open completely, so you get that open air feeling in the unit itself. It was so nice!! The bathrooms were clean, huge and accommodating. We had 2 in our unit, and both had double sinks and large showers. A large soaking tub was also in the master bathroom. The towels were clean, very soft and plush. The beds were soft, the pillows were comfortable and the linens on the bed were soft and high end. Large closets, 2 nightstands with additional drawers and a large dresser in each BR. Each bedroom had a large flat screen, as did the living room which also had a dvd player. An in-room safe was in one of the BR closets as well. We found all the staff to be very polite, friendly and helpful. In our building, the front desk was staffed 24 hours a day and everyone we encountered greeted us by name. The concierge was helpful and responsive - she made all of our dinner reservations, tour arrangements and made suggestions as to where we should take our son snorkeling. I have nothing negative to say about this resort at all, we were truly happy with the location, the facility, the amenities -- all of it, we absolutely loved it here! I do have to comment on \"the odor problem,\" as previous reviewers commented on it. Never once during our entire stay did any of us ever catch a whiff of anything even remotely resembling a sewage smell. We visited all 3 pools at different times of the day, nothing. We spent a ton of time on our lanai at different times of the day, nothing. MIL is a smoker, I went with her downstairs, out to the front of the building (where there is a designated smoking area) and again, nothing. I'm not discounting others' experiences, I'm just saying that we never once encountered any odor problem at all, and I was looking for it because I had read about it here. The wind wasn't that big of deal either. Yes it was windy, sometimes it was gusty, but you're visiting a resort on a tropical island that is directly on the ocean and also basically at the foot of the mountains -- it's going to be a bit windy folks! It was nothing that ruined our trip -- quite the contrary! I think the breezes were a nice buffer for the very warm July sun and probably allowed us to stay out in direct sunlight for longer periods of time each day that we would have had there not been a breeze. Don't let the wind scare you off. We have traveled extensively throughout the Carribbean and found this resort to be among the very best that we've ever stayed. It's absolutely lovely, my family thoroughly enjoyed this resort and wouldn't hesitate to return.

We have three kids ages, 5, 4, and 2. We stayed in a one bedroom unit overlooking the dormant construction site next door. We booked through the Honua Kai vacation rentals on VRBO. We were originally going to book straight through VRBO, but had heard that the service was different if you booked through a private owner. So we called Honua Kai and talked to someone in their property management office and booked a private unit through them. She told us that we would receive the same accomodations cleaning, charging priveleges, fancy soaps, wireless internet, etc. as booking through the hotel and the amount was over a 100 dollars less a night. Well, it wasn't the same, as stated in previous reviews, the maid service really lacked. The never cleaned the dishes, unloaded the dishwasher, vacuumed or mopped. We walked into the place with a stain on the tile floor. There were no L'Occitane bathroom soaps/shampoos at all. However, the service in every other part of the hotel was awesome. The valet/parking guy James was awesome...he always asked where we were going and gave suggestions. He helped us out all the time. Also, the market on site is great, however, it is all healthy food. For those late night cravings, there is not a lot to get. It is wonderful having a washer/dryer combo in the room so you don't come home with lots of dirty laundry, however, they were hard to figure out how to use and there wasn't any manuals. Duke's Beach House on the property is great. Good food, dinner is overpriced, but you can also go at dinner, but eat on the lunch menu. Maui pie is awesome! Pools are by far the best we've seen. Perfect for little ones! The only downside is the cabana waiters don't start until 12 noon and that can be a pain while on vacation and wanting a cold beverage. The lanais off the rooms are the best on the island. We walked all down the boardwalk and the lanais off the other hotels are hilarious compared to the Honua Kai. The beds are so comfortable too...great mattresses! Our kids shared the pull out couch which was plenty big for the three of them. I am extremely picky about hotels, but even with the lack of maid service, we did receive new linens each day....I would definitely stay there again. I really think it is just a new hotel and they are still finding their groove. There isn't anything run down about the hotel. Paint is still new, furniture not scraped up and floors pretty clean. People describe an odor from a sewage plant, we NEVER smelled a thing and it was COMPLETELY windy our entire trip. I have a strong sense of smell and I was completely worried about booking this hotel based on previous reviews stating the strong smell....again, I NEVER smelled anything. Honua Kai is a great place if you are traveling with kids, especially little ones. Their pools start at 3 feet which is great with little ones. The water slide is fantastic too, although the attendants that are in charge of it don't really do a good job of timing out the kids, a few accidents because of two kids going down too close together. We thought about staying in Wailea, but we ended up going down there for a day trip. The wind was a little more calm, but it's a sleepy little area. Much more to do in Kaanapali/Lahaina area.

We were placed in the new 2nd tower of the resort and since peak season was just over, it was a really calm peaceful retreat. We were placed on the 2nd FL with a partial ocean view our room was kitty corner from the lobby and initially we were concerned about noise from crowds hanging outside the lobby at night. But it really was not a problem at all. We literally felt like we had the resort to ourselves. We saw more workers there than guests. They really take care of the grounds there. The room service was spotty, one day we had an excellent maid who unloaded our clean dishes from the dishwasher and reloaded the dishwasher with dirty dishes and cleaned them for us. She also made our bed, cleaned the bathroom, replaced our bath towels and gave us extra dishwasher detergent. The next day it must've been a different maid because she didn't do anything, didn't make our bed, didn't clean the bathroom, she only took out the garbage from under our sink. That was the only displeasure on the whole trip. Both times we left a small tip on the coffee table but they never took it. The daily resort fee must cover their tip, go figure. Everything in the unit was new. The appliances were barely used, large refrigerator with icemaker, dishwasher microwave, and the best part was the washer dryer. Great for a beach vacation. Everything from the appliances, furniture, linens, pots & pans were high end and name brand. I'm name dropping now - stainless steel bosch appliances, cuisinart toaster, cuisinart pots & pans, andrew morgan bed throws, fleetwood furniture, nanowall foldable doors for the lanai. The unit was a really good deal for the price we paid. The view from the lanai is priceless, you can see the beach and the ocean.

There are also a few larger units of about 2700 sq. ft. and a few penthouses. Most of the three-bedroom units have direct ocean views. Some of the inner courtyard two-bedroom units also have direct ocean views from the living areas in the unit. Other two- and one-bedroom units have ocean views from their lanais. Some of the units are on east side of the building and only have mountain views. Check the interactive floorplans on the Honua Kai website. A construction site immediately adjacent to the south side of the Hokulani tower is scheduled to become another Westin property. This is the newest condominium property built in Kaanapali in the last 25 years and it is very well done. The location allows easy access to the large and uncrowded north Kaanapali beach with great sunset views toward the islands of Lanai and Molokai. Honua Kai is the last resort on North Kaanapali beach with direct access to the boardwalk that connects Westin timeshare properties and other resorts north of the Sheraton Hotel at Black Rock. Honua Kai has two large u-shaped buildings\u00e2\u20ac\u201dHokulani and Konea towers\u00e2\u20ac\u201deach with different entrances, lobbies, amenities and decors shared by guests and residents. The Spa is yet to be opened in the Konea tower but will be easily accessible from either tower. There are multiple pools on the grounds with a more formal pool in front of the Hokulani tower and more playful pools with slides and waterfalls in front of the Konea tower. The pools are located near the beach with large lawn areas for other outdoor activities. There is an activities center near the pools for pool flotation devices, boogie boards, fresh towels and other options. Partially covered cabana chairs and fully covered gazebos around the pool areas are available for daily rental. Duke's restaurant is located in front of the two towers and offers good quality breakfast, lunch and dinner menus. A future fine dining restaurant is planned for the Konea tower. There is a gourmet market in the Hokulani tower with a smaller express version in the Konea tower. The units are furnished with very comfortable king-sized beds and linens, complete kitchens including Bosch appliances (Viking brand in the premium ocean-front units) dishes and utensils, stacked small washer/condensation-dryer units (longer dry times than traditional vented models), granite countertops, big screen TVs and more. The three-bedroom units have one king-sized bed that can be separated into two twin-sized beds. The lanais are separated from the interiors by retractable glass walls with optional screens. Opening the glass walls creates the indoor-outdoor living environment that is so pleasant in Hawaii. The finishes include granite countertops, solid wood doors, halogen lighting, ceiling fans and comfortable contemporary fabrics. There is a bellman to help with luggage upon arrival. Parking is conveniently located under the building with key card access (daily fee paid directly to the resort). The front desk and housekeeping services are available to units that are part of the Honua Kai rental pool. The property is conveniently located between Kapalua and Lahaina.

My only complaint is that given how low the occupancy is right now, they don't always have full staff around, and we weren't able to get someone from housekeeping one afternoon. But, on the whole, I would highly recommend this place, especially now while everything is still brand new and it's not crowded at all.

I get tripadvisor emails that alert when flights are cheapest and used that to guide a less expensive trip because we had visited Maui 4 other times in the last 7 years and I know how expensive it can be. I checked all sorts of sources to find a great deal and I found a RARE deal for a 4 star resort this time to be AAA travel and they use Pleasant Holidays. And since I was trying to do it on a low budget, I booked the Special Resort View Ohana room. We stayed for 7 nights. Due to it being sooo reasonable I set my expectations very low on the room view and I expected a mountain or parking lot view for the price. I was sooo happy to find they had upgraded us to a partial ocean view room located at the inside back corner on the 3rd floor of the Hokulani tower. This was located on the same side as the Aina Market store and that made it very convenient for groceries we forgot to get at the bigger grocery store on the way from the airport. We had always stayed at the Hyatt in the past and this was our first condo-style resort stay. I've got to say that we kept staying at the Hyatt because we loved the comfy beds and ocean/water sounds at night and their adult pool with waterfalls is right next to the beach. The Honua Kai met this expectation as well plus the doors open all the way up at the lanai giving a very open air feeling and it made the room feel even larger. It had a very nice fully equipped kitchen that made cooking breakfast very fun, but we ate breakfast at Dukes the 3rd day and loved their breakfast sooo much we didn't cook it again (great omlets and banana mac nut pancakes). I am one of those folks that often goes out for lattes but the drip coffee supplied was sooo good in the room that I made it almost every day and I even found a little creamer cup in the unit that I filled with my half and half. It was very windy the first several days of our trip but very nice the last few days. My parents and sister were staying at a resort near black rock in Kaanapali beach area and it was very windy there too. Last few days were perfect though (no wind) so we went snorkeling at the beach in front of Honua Kai and it was very nice. As well, the pool was great. Cutie pie (Ryan) from Dukes was serving us drinks at the pool on our first windy day and he quickly replaced a few of the drinks that got away at no charge. We also loved the pupu at Dukes (crispy coconut shrimp, crab and macnut wontons, and mango BBQ ribs) and the Mai tais were great as well as dinner one evening plus they have a happy hour menu from 3 to 5pm with $5 mai tai's and discount beers. One night we took our good bottle of wine down to the edge of the koi pond as it was very romantic there with the tiki torches lit. What else can I say, I love Maui and I loved this resort. Oh and we found no unpleasant odors on windy days and on calm days. Plus the hotel staff was fantastic, the parking convenient and valet quick and friendly. And they allowed my parents and sister to enjoy the pool with us with free parking tokens supplied to them by Dukes. Perfect for families. I still prefer the Hyatt pool due to the adult-only side with the new pool-side bar for adult only/romantic trips and the hammocks by the beach but I gotta say, I love the Honua Kai condo-style rooms better than the Hyatt rooms and I loved Dukes drink prices.", "Date": "May 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cNice, but.......................\u201d", "Author": "wrnandwonderful", "ReviewID": "UR65847108", "Content": "We had booked our trip at Honua Kai through our travel agent. Unfortunately, using a travel agent ultimately means you end up booking the room using the management group that mans the front desk and generally runs the resort. First off, this was a trip we had booked to celebrate my 50th b-day as well as my son and husbands birthdays (all are within 8 days of each other!) After much deliberation and reading all the glowing reviews on tripadvisor, we decided to book a 2 bedroom with a partial ocean view. When we booked a few months before, I made a request to have a room with a pool view realizing that, although we may not be getting a dead on ocean view......we would at least have the ambience of a water view. What we ended up with was one of the biggest dissapointments of our vacation. After being handed the keys to a back corner suite with a view of the ocean to the side of the lanai (when you leaned over the railing) and a full on view of a grassy field with a noisy highway (nothing like the sound of cars and semi-trucks to say your on vacation....right?).......we went back to the desk and asked for other options. The next was a room on the inner court on the ground level. Big lanai, a barely there view of the ocean on your tippy toes over the overgrown foliage in the garden next to the lanai. It also had the added benefit of giving anyone walking by a full on view of our resort experience. I tried one more time with the front desk, thinking maybe the third time would be a charm. They handed me the keys to another suite and said that this was our last option. It was on the same side as the first unit but a little further up to the front of the building with a slightly better view of the water. So we walked in, went out to the lanai and well......I felt my eyes well up. The wind was whipping around and we got the distinct scent of sewage wafting up to meet us upon our entrance outside. We still had a view of the pasture with the main highway noise. At this point we gave up. I tredged back to the front desk and asked for the keys to the unit on the inner court first floor. At least we would be somewhat protected from the winds and the scent of sewage (or so we thought.) We asked to be kept on a waiting list for a unit that met our request when we booked months earlier. That was the last time I had any contact with the front desk. They never got back to us (I think our request was probably tossed in the garbage after we left the lobby.) First off, this unit does not have a viable view of anything other than the other guests walking past the lanai and a grassy courtyard. Great for people watching, but if I wanted to people watch I would have booked a trip to New York. I felt as though the big $$$$ we spent to book this unit was a huge rip off. My husband thought that this unit was probably not a sold unit. In other words, no comforts of home. No condiments (come on.....at least some salt and pepper), no foil, plastic wrap, nothing. The money we had hoped to save by cooking a few meals in the unit was never seen. We ended up at the grocery store across the street and by the time we payed the bill, we could have easily eaten out and saved ourselves the money, as well as the headache of trying to make up for the lack of even the basics for cooking a meal. After reading the reviews here on tripadvisor by people who had units much better equiped than ours, it seemed viable that indeed, we were probably in a unit the resort owned and hadn't sold yet. Maybe I'm wrong, but after thinking about it, it made sense that they might push you into one of these unowned units. It would stand to reason that the potential for the management company to make more money with one of these units might sway them to push a customer into occupancy. Regardless, it was such a bummer to come to the realization that the money we spent a night in this unit was what we would leave Hawaii with........the feeling we were taken. I do think Honua Kai is a lovely resort. The three pools are nice, none however are deeper than 5ft. No diving here, but they are refreshing none the less. You will not completely escape the smell of the sewage plant across the highway. Many times, as we sunbathed at the pools, we would catch the scent of sewage. The other thing that has to be mentioned was something I only briefly touched on. THE WIND!!!!! It dominated our trip. The trade winds here are crazy and while I do not believe it is a problem everyday of the year here, it certainly should be considered when you are trying to plan your vacation. It was a constant source of irritation. You couldn't go anywhere on the grounds without having to contend with the wind. It blew our clothing on our lanai out onto the the grassy courtyard, it toppeled over our cocktails at the pools, it made reading at the pool a challenge as well. Lastly, housekeeping needs to step it up. I felt the need to sanitize when I looked around and realized there were fingerprints and smudges on every surface. From the cocktail tables to the faucets in the restrooms. They leave a message that all the units are lightly cleaned everyday and on the third day the rooms are given a deeper cleaning. While they were really good about refreshing towels and making our beds, I can say without a doubt there was never a deep cleaning during our stay and many times I simply took it upon myself to take care of the deeper cleaning. At least what I could, given the lack of cleaning products. The nice thing though was that the resort was definately at a low occupancy. One need only walk around to see that this was not a crowded place. Most of the rooms on the inner courtyard were not occupied (adding to our ire) and there were many times we could go to the pool and only a handful of people would be lounging around. You could easily find a chair that wasn't surrounded by people and feel like you were by yourself. All in all I would say that Honua Kai resort is indeed a beautiful facility. The scent of sewage wasn't always there so I might have been able to overlook it if our overall experience hadn't been one of regret about our suite. Take my advise........go thru the owners of these condos. Absolutely, there should be no surprise as to what you are buying for your money and hindsight being 20/20, I now realize I could of spent a whole lot less and gotten a better unit overall. The owners will give you a much more precise description of the unit and what the view entails. I also think there is more of an incentive for the owner to make sure your experience is a good one too. There are even a few privately owned companies on the island that advertise some of the owner owned condos for rent. But, vrbo really seems to have the best of the best and is a more reputable avenue to deal with owners directly. As I said before, my experience was definately skewed by my attempts to have an experience that lived up to what the resort claims. Being at the mercy of the management company to live up to those expectations was disappointing. If I ever go back it will be armed with the knowledge that I do not need to be led by a faceless entity deciding how my experience will evolve. Next time, if there is a next time, it will be with the knowledge that I have other options. You do too!

Full kitchen completely outfitted with all cooking equipment. Great Viking BBQ's outside near the pool. Great gyms. Duke's Restaurant in front of Resort on the beach!! I promise....that you will love this Resort and the prices are introductory and exceptional. The beach is not crowded and great for snorkling. There are great reefs right in front of the property. Beautiful Koi pond and public area's with 4 pools. I wud recommend requesting a room facing the ocean. Go for the one bedroom, minimum (sleeps 4 easily with fold out queen sofabed in livingroom). The 2 bedroom can sleep 6 easily with 2 full bathrooms. Or, if it's just 2 of you the studio is better than any other hotel room anywhere on Maui. Just try to get one with a view. Dukes is fun, great food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Great nightly entertainment too. There is a beach walk that you can take all of the way to Whalers Village. Only drawback is that the Spa is not complete. But, you can spend your spa time at the pool sliding down the water slide. Or stroll next door to the spa at the Westin.

The owners have made sure that everything was included in this condo, from the two big flat-screen TV's to great bed linens to the L'Occitane products in the bathroom, as well as secure underground parking. Free WiFi is included, and they even sent us a big welcome basket loaded with fruits, nuts, etc., thanking us for spending our Silver Anniversary at their condo. They've also loaded up their storage area with beach chairs, boogie boards, etc. All very thoughtful. The condo looks out on both the ocean and the West Maui Mountains. We came here to do a little sightseeing and to chill out, and we were successful with both. The resort, including pool and grounds, is gorgeous. We ate at Duke's, an open-air restaurant on the beach, several times while we were there - great food, and even better MaiTai's. The on-site concierge, Kimmee, is extremely helpful. She helped us plan a helicopter tour (pricey but worth every penny) and encouraged us to take a sunset cruise since the humpback whales were still there (saw a TON of them on the cruise). She was also able to print out our boarding passes for our trip home. We had rented a convertible for the trip, so spent some time cruising all around Maui. There is some spectacular ocean scenery going north towards Kapalua. We passed on driving to Hana since it eats up an entire day, but we saw a lot of waterfalls and scenery on the helicopter tour that we would never have seen otherwise. Lahaina was loaded with shops and art galleries, so we spent a fair amount of time there. We took in the Feast at LeLe luau as well - front row tables for couples - and that was a lot of fun. The only downside was our flight - Atlanta to Maui is a long way. We booked first-class tickets using frequent flier miles almost 11 months before the trip, so that helped a lot. We would make this trip again in a heartbeat, and wouldn't hesitate to stay in the same unit.

For my 40th birthday and our kids' Spring Break, we wanted to visit Maui and stay at a beachfront resort with plenty of amenities (fun pools, mainly) for our two boys, ages 2 and 8. After months of research on tripadvisor, we wanted to stay at Honua Kai since it was brand new and had great reviews. Being north of Black Rock also made it more appealing since there are mainly vacation condos (and not hotels), making the beaches and pools seem less crowded than at the mega-resorts. We first tried booking through Intrawest, the rental management company, but they only had \"Mountain-view\" units that also overlooked the parking lot and main road. Their condos in the courtyard were nice, but more than we could afford to spend. Instead, we found a owner on homeaway.com at $250 per night for a one-bedroom Oceanview condo. We stayed in unit #514 of the Hokulani Building, its on the fifth floor and had great views of the Pacific Ocean and West Maui mountains. It had very nice furniture, a beautiful kitchen with Bosch appliances and granite countertops, a large bathroom with two sinks (you'll need it for four people), a washer and dryer, two LCD TVs, and a big lanai to relax and enjoy breakfast. The owners were very nice and accommodating throughout the whole rental process. They stocked the condo with beach towels, boogie boards and beach chairs so that we didn't have to buy them while we were there. They also had movies, games and a pack and play for our two year-old. These were extra conveniences that we couldn't find at hotels. That side of the resort is next to an empty lot that was to be the third phase of the Westin Kaanapali Villas. They finished the foundation and won't start up again for another couple of years, according to the staff. I guess the timeshare market has cooled down a bit with the rest of the real estate. It was nice and quiet, and we had a lot of sunlight in the condo. You can also see a lot more of the Ocean and the entire island of Lanai in the distance. The other condos in the courtyard overlooks the pools and nice landscaping, but they really are in a \"fishbowl\" as another review mentioned. The lanais face each other, so its not as private. The staff at Honua Kai were very nice. We got to know everyone from the bellhop, front desk, Kimmie (the concierge), and the waiters at the pools. Its hard not to be friendly when you live on Maui! We would eat lunch at the Aina Gourmet Market near the Lobby. They have great sandwiches and gelato at reasonable prices. There is even a recreational office near the pools where you can rent or buy snorkeling gear, sunscreen, or set up a whale-watching excursion. The three pools were amazing and each had their own flair. The one at our building was more relaxed, with an infinity-edge looking into the Ocean. The kids' pool had a waterslide, grotto, sand area, and some shallow spots for the younger kids to play at. The third pool was more of a lazy-river type with bridges and lush landscaping. There were also spas at every pool. With the resort of this size, it never felt crowded. I know that people are still closing escrow in the newer Konea Tower, maybe that has something to do with it. There are also Viking grills near the pools that you can use, and they were always cleaned by the staff. It was nice to swim all day, cook your dinner, eat it poolside and watch the sunset. The beach in front of Honua Kai was nice. There are coral reefs as you enter the water, which is great snorkeling but you must pack your sport sandals to protect your feet. The water was fine, and we even saw a couple of whales out in the distance. You don't want to miss Duke's Maui restaurant. We ate there four times during our stay, three for breakfast and one for dinner. Great food, friendly service, comfortable atmosphere, and reasonable prices. The Hula Pie truly lives up to its reputation! We got to see Henry Kapono, a famous Hawaiian musician, performing there on Friday night with the sunsetting behind him.

Appliances were top notch, furniture was clean and comfortable, bed was great as well. Toiletries were provided. I would defiantly recommend this property. My wife and I are not big nightlife people so the low key, quite and laid back atmosphere of the resort fit us perfectly. Because the property is a condo type property there is not a high density of guest for its size. If fact my wife and I rarely saw anyone in the elevators and only and handful of guest at the pools and beach. This made it feel secluded and romantic. Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant is an added pleasure, great fish and drinks. The main dining room is pricey but the food is very good. The bar menu is more reasonable with great selection for a lighter casual meal. Great place to have a beer and watch the sunset!!! Location was great as well. Kaanapali beach with all the resorts, shops and restaurants is just a 20 minute walk down the beach walk. Some nice snorkeling spots are just a 5 minute walk. You can also do a beach scuba dive from this location as well. Lots of sea life included turtles and Humuhumunukunukuapaa. Couple visits you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to miss while on Maui. The road to Hana\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. Fantastic!!! Just get a guide first and scope out the sites you want to see. Snorkeling at mile marker 14 on State Highway 30 (the one that goes through Lahaina), beach is not much but it is easy to get into the water, lots of fish, the coral is only about 2 to 3 feet below the surface and you can swim out 50+ yards. The Gazebo restaurant for breakfast at Napili Bay. And if you are looking for a great scuba dive shop I would recommend New Horizons, great fun. Lahaina is just a 10 minute drive. I would definitely recommend the Honua Kai Resort and Spa for a great Relaxed Holiday.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver", "Title": "\u201cPossibly a great condo, but didn't work out for us.\u201d", "Author": "Nat022", "ReviewID": "UR59742964", "Content": "The trip started out great, we were all having a great time.

They will not help you with anything. Any and all requests had to go through the property owner including room cleaning, towels, pretty much anything you can think of. If you say you are 3rd party they won't even let you use the computers at the business center. Which apparently you can only print boarding passes with. The spa was advertised to be open but wasn't. The weather is also not as good at the north end of the beach so we often had rain either in the morning or afternoon. It was also very very windy. The beach in front of the hotel was pretty rough and not really a place for kids to play. But the pool more than made up for that. All in all, a disappointing vacation but mostly because we got sick.

We loved this beautiful resort. It was a great stay, from the time we walked into the luxurious yet comfortable lobby - with gleaming floors, cosy lounge nooks, fresh flowers, staff by your side and a beautiful Koi pond, we felt like we have stepped into paradise. Everything was perfect and it's well worth the hefty price tag to stay here. The suite we had was functional, roomy and had a very homey feel. Kimmy, the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s concierge was extremely helpful, gracious and welcomed our family to Maui with opened arms. It was my favourite hotel we stayed in all of Maui (and we stayed in 4 other hotels), which says allot about the quality of this place. The pool and beach areas where relaxing and never crowded unlike so many other resorts. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s market and Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant where great places to dine. We had the best Lava Flow drinks at Duke\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Just some things to keep in mind if you stay here and some travel tips: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 If you book a resort-view suite, make sure to ask for the south-east side and a high floor (as for now, there are no construction going on) and you should be able to see part of the ocean if you have a room above the 4th floor. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like street noise, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to book a resort-view suite, as you will get this no matter where your room is located. So, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like street noise, pay up and get an ocean-view suite. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s spa isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t opened yet but I'm sure it will be a great place, it was to bad we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try it out yet (it should be opened in mid-April, 2010) \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 In the Canary Mall, (about 4 stop lights south of the resort) Safeway is a great place to buy groceries, wine, beer, liquor etc. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Go to the Old Lahaina Luau, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lots of fun and is a great way to learn about Hawaii\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s culture \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Take the scenic drive up the Kapalua trail, past the Ritz-Carlton, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s well worth it \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Try out the island\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s banana bread and the shave ice, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great treat. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 Take the road trip to Hana, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so worth it but make sure to stay overnight at Hotel Hana, as you will need this after the drive. \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 On the way to Hana, stop in Paia, a great chic little town with neat shops and places to dine at Happy travels.

Toiletries, laundry detergent, kitchen, soaps, paper towels in adequate supply. Bedding was changed everyday. I suggest room service do a thorough daily polish of the Kitchen and bath counter tops, and a light washing of the floor. (They do provide a mop and pail in the broom closet.)

We will return, and will highly recommend your Condos to all our family and friends. We have friends who are arriving next week. We booked with Expedia, where we found the best deal. We felt the $25 resort fee covered the parking of our rental Jeep, awesome pools and decks, and the numerous beach towels. However, many other guests have mentioned the fee was steep. Most hotels charge this much for daily parking. Maybe Honua Kai should re-look the fee if guests are not using full services (Parking/Towels?) We enjoy good family dinners, and I prepared most of our awesome Hawaiian ingredients meals in. There is an awesome fish shop, and produce shop less than three blocks away. One block away is Times market, I would compare to a great Save on Foods. Look no more further, the Meat, Produce and Fruit are awesome!!! We went out to dinner at Dukes Restaurant on our first night. Unfortunately only two of our four meals were delicious. The Risotto, and Ravioli were very good, however they should really take the Chicken & Mahi Mahi off the menu. PERIOD! The Ice Cream Dessert is Awesome! Everyday we drove approximately 10 minutes and spent our mornings and early afternoons at the Beautiful, D.T. Flemming Beach Park, rated as the Best Beach in America in 2006!, Great Beach, waves, and peace, why go anywhere else? After having a light lunch back at the condo we spend our entire afternoon at the onsite pool decks, awesome sun chairs, great pools, and incredible beach whale views. The Concierge was great, we booked the VIP Hyatt Luau, beautiful show, awesome meal. Our daughters even had pictures taken with the handsome young dancers that came out to meet everyone at the end of the show. The Concierge also booked our daughters surfing lessons at Royal Hawaiian Surf Co. The girls are awesome swimmers, so they were up and surfing the waves real quick with the excellent instructor. We watched and took pictures close by. Whalers Village Shopping Mall is close by, a quick walk or drive. We did a bit of shopping here, and also picked up sun tan lotion, and Chocolate gifts at the ABC Store. We spent a lot of time on Front Street, great shopping, Best Shaved Ice, Ululani's Hawaiian Shave Ice, see David and his staff, very friendly customer service!!! Ono's Gelato has the Best Italian Ice Cream!, (friendly gentlemen service.) We ate another dinner out at the Hard Rock Cafe, great food atmosphere, and service! We ventured out to Kihei for some quick good deals, on chain's and gifts. Our daughter's favourite Mall, Queen Ka\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ahumanu Centre where they found \"Forever 21!\" Great shopping even with no big sale. The Best Coffee, Visit the MauiGrown Coffee Company Store and sample the famous Maui Mokka tm and other varieties of coffee grown by MauiGrown Coffee. The MauiGrown Coffee Company Store offers both green coffee and roasted coffee as well as coffee from other parts of Maui and Kona coffee. They are located in Lahaina at 277 Lahainaluna Road next to the famous Lahaina Smokestack. We brought a few lbs home for us and family.

The units are big and beautifully decorated. Duke's restaurant is reasonable and family friendly. It is a perfect location to take nice walks along the north kaanapali boardwalk and the Times supermarket is only a 10 minute walk away. The main drawback here is the beach. There is coral all the way up to the point where the sand meets the waves. I was not comfortable swimming here and wouldn't let my kids play in the waves. This means that we were driving south to the Eldorado beach or over to the Whaler's village side. I missed not being able to jump in the water first thing in the morning.

I had a big fall on some slippery pool deck on the day after we arrived. We saw numerous other people wipe out on on the pool deck. It was new and hadn't been roughed up yet, I guess. When I fell, I had been carrying my son and, luckily, he was not hurt. I was banged up with some bruises and scrapes and couldn't walk well for a few days.

In summary, our stay was ruined by the fact that we could not take a hot BATH even after being transferred to different rooms - creating a large waste of time during our once in a lifetime event. We are so disappointed. Specifically, let me start by saying that we stayed in the OCEAN view room, we paid for ocean view but instead of the ocean you get to see other people's rooms with a bit of the ocean as an aside. The design of the hotel is such that NONE of the rooms have a pure ocean view except for very few rooms on the corners. I would not recommend anyone stay here that wants a worry free get-away experience. Almost everything you have to do yourself. the daily housekeeping only replaces towels and throws out the trash. For the price of the rooms, I would expect that they would at least do the bed daily as well, but sorry no can do. Finally, these rooms all have very bad water heaters. we stayed in a room that had a nice bathroom with a bathtub and shower. You would think that you should be able to take a bath, but not so as after just 5 minutes the water becomes less hot until almost cold. We had them transfer us to a different room, but SAME problem there too -- you would think that they would have checked this before having us pack and relocate.

Having recently opened up their additional pools, waterslide, Duke's restaurant, the resort has everything you need with the exception of an on-site spa (which is coming mid-2010). The architecture of the resort, the building construction and many other technical aspects of the resort are all finished at the highest level -- far surpassing the Westin Villas, updated Marriott suites, and other updated versions of the many 25yr old+ properties in Kaanapali. Some of this might be more subtle than the extreme luxury that is more easily appreciated. The kitchens are all fully equipped with high-end stainless steel Bosch (quiet) appliances, granite counters, glass-tile backsplash, full glassware, placesettings, pots/pans and all utensils needed to produce a gourmet meal at this gourmet resort. The living rooms and bedrooms are all appointed with high-end furniture, large flat screen LCD's with HDTV (and premium movie channels) and a Blu-Ray DVD in the living room with I-pod docking station/system. The bedrooms have extremely comfortable king-size beds with high-end linens. All of the bathrooms have double-vanities with granite, separate soaking tub and large glass-enclosed showers. All units are equipped with unique \"nanadoors\" which fully open to blend the indoor and outdoor -- for the larger units (we stayed in a 2 bedroom) with large lanais, this translates to having an open window space that can go 20-30 feet long. The multiple pools are great (infinity pool, family pool, lazy pools) each with 2 hot tubs and the recently opened family pool that comes with a waterslide, waterfalls (and enclosed caves), a sandy area for real little ones and natural stone-enclosed hot tubs all with high-pressure jets and beautiful views to the ocean. Dukes restaurant is on-property and just opened a week before we arrived and produces a good-quality breakfast, lunch and dinner with full pool food and tropical drinks service -- nothing is spared in providing the luxury hotel experience in this condo resort. If you want to grill your own fish or steaks for dinner, there are many Viking grills with marble counters (We grill at home all the time and have never experienced grills this nice -- not to mention my grill at home doesn't come equipped with direct ocean views). Great swimming at Honua Kai beach with snorkeling (and scuba) -- top snorkeling at Blackrock a 15 minute walk down the boardwalk -- a boardwalk that goes all the way from Honua Kai to Whalers Village shopping down to the Hyatt. I've saved the best for last: the service/staff without exception were great! This applies to the bell staff, the front desk, the concierge, the pool staff, all the way to the engineering and landscaping staff -- they must have all gone through great customer service training because everyone seemed focused on making sure the customer experience was unparalleled. This almost brand new resort is firing on all cylinders! One of the most amazing things is that you can stay at Honua Kai by renting from owners at vrbo.com at prices less than the much older, lesser quality properties/resorts on the island.

Very comfortable bed, nice kitchen with granite counters, Bosch appliances, etc. Full size Bosch washer/dryer. Our lanai was a good size and we spent most of our time out there. The staff are all very helpful and friendly. We loved having Duke's restaurant right on the property. They have a small fitness room. Better to walk on the boardwalk which goes about 6 miles. They have a great deli on the ground floor which was was perfect. There are a few minor negatives about the property. But I think if you know about it, they're easily avoided. They nickel and dime you to death. You pay a daily $25 resort fee. That was fine as it includes valet parking, etc. But if you go to the pool and you want a cushion on your very hard chair, that's an extra $10 a day, per chair. If you want to have a chair at the beach that's also another $10 a day, per chair. The chairs were not comfortable and supposedly had an attachment that would block the sun, but they were all broken. So if we go back, we'll stop and buy some beach chairs and an umbrella. And at 5pm they take up the cushions and chairs. No exceptions. Also, when you check in, they have you take chits for how many beach towels you're going to use during your stay. You can change them out every day, but you need to make sure you turn in the exact amount of towels at the end of your stay so you don't get charged $25 a towel. I found that incredibly annoying. I was always having to make sure we had 4 towels. At the end of your stay you turn them in and they pool person gives you chits back for your towels that you turn in when you're checking out. It was annoying and unnecessary. Who wants to go on vacation and worry about the number of towels you're using. They don't have a computer available to use. They used the excuse that they had just opened, but they've been open for almost a year. So bring your computer if you need to use one. Hopefully not.

They do supply you with a few packets of dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, dish soap and some fabric softener (Bounce). There is also a washer and dryer which is very handy. The lanai was spacious and we had a great ocean view. Basic housekeeping (taking out trash, making beds and replacing towels) was done everyday. However a better cleaning (cleaning floors and bathroom) was only done every third or fourth day. Pool: The pool was great for us as the deepest part of the pool was 4ft as we had a 22 month old with us. There was also an area of the pool which was only 1/2 ft deep so great for her to walk in. It was pretty much empty most of the time we were there. Beach: It was good for the most part, however it was not good for young kids as the tide was very strong and could easily pull them in. When you walk further up the beach there are calmer areas. Tip if you are travelling with very young ones, Baby Beach in Lahaina is great as there are no waves at all and the water is very calm.

I guess our attitude should have been checked at the door because we wanted to go to Kaui but it was sold out due to the short time period that we planned our vacation and Maui was on sale...so we headed to Maui. Now this isn't our first time there but our last visit was 8 years ago and it has definitely been built up over the last 8 years! Of course from my first time to visit Maui in 1989 it has changed dramatically and become like a Hawaiian Beverly Hills or Newport Beach. We do like Kona, Kauai and Oahu much better since it still has the island feeling although Kauai has lost a little of this over the last few years. The staff at the hotel was great we had several problems and they addressed it immediately \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so they were incredible. I had reserved an ocean view and most of the rooms are partial ocean views but sold as ocean view. So I was shown another room that had a great view of the ocean but looked over a lot with unfinished construction and dirt which was all over the patio because of it being a high wind area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so the dirt would blow into the hotel room during high winds which is most of the time on the north part of the island due to the valley.

Oh and if they tell you that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need air conditioner then they are lying because it is hot in September! Even though they wanted to move us at 1030 at night we stayed and moved into a fantastic upgrade 2 bedroom condo the next morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this one had an ocean view. So again the staff was incredible and addressed problems immediately.

The only rooms with true ocean views are the 3 bedroom suites at the end \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are no ocean front rooms. My husband and I could not figure out why someone would design the hotel this way since they have plenty of property (and spent a great deal of money on the d\u00c3\u00a9cor) and all of the other hotels in the area are curved to where they face the ocean and certainly do not face other rooms. So when this hotel does become busy (it is new and still under construction) there will be little privacy. The rooms are fantastic again and are high end from appliances to bedding. So we were very comfortable and felt like we had never left Orange County \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in fact next time we will just book a room in Newport Beach, Malibu or Santa Monica \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have the same effect without the flight! Overall the staff and accommodations were great but we were looking for more of a tropical feel to get away from where we live now. So if you are looking for a California get away in Hawaii then this place and island is for you!", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cFantastic time, can't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "winelovinlady", "ReviewID": "UR42265107", "Content": "We stayed at Honua Kai for 6 nights, and rented one of the one bedroom suites from the VRBO website from someone who owns room 514.

The location of Honua Kai is great, 7 minutes to Lahaina and to Kapalua. The room itself was awesome, the bed was sooo comfortable and it was relaxing to be able to hang out in the room, one person could be taking a nap in the bedroom, the other could be taking in the view or watching tv. The pool was never too busy since the hotel was pretty empty. Loved the Aina store on the main floor, I got Gelato there several times and coffee. We loved our time here, and would definitely recommend for anyone to check out the VRBO website...great deals from people who own the units and are trying to rent them out, our transaction went very smoothly.

This complex will truly be amazing once it is completed. First the positives. The rooms are gorgeous with granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, and other amenities of a 5 star hotel. The location is also great and we felt like we had a private beach as there were only a couple of people there. If you walk 5 minutes down the beach path to the Westin Villas it is packed. The people who worked there are extremely nice and helpful. The current negatives (which should be fixed once the second tower is opened) is there is moderate construction noise which starts early (7 AM). Some days you could not hear a thing and other days there was significant noise with a lot of work vehicles there. There is only one pool which (although beautiful) is just a pool. We had the luxury of having friends stay at the Westin Villas at the same time and the Westin was packed (to crowded for my liking) but they had a pirate pool with waterslides which the kids loved. The Honua Kai has plans to have a kids pool and water park in the second phase. The other negative is there is no restaurant at the current time. Other comments: My parents got a room at the Honua Kai direct while we rented through an owner on VRBO. There were pros and cons to each of these. Renting direct was more expensive but you got daily made service and other amenities (shampoo, laundry detergent, etc.) you'd find in a hotel. They also got complimentary towels at the pool and free parking items which we had to pay extra for. They also were shown several rooms and got to choose which one they liked best. Our room through the owner was cheaper and had things such as spices, coffee filters, other cooking items as well as full sized beach towels and other things you'd associate with a condo. Additionally, our key got demagnetized while we were out (were told this happens if you keep it to close to your cellphone) and we could not get security at the complex to let us into the room (where we had other keys). We had to sit around until the offsight condo manager drove over and let us into the room. Overall: A great place to stay and will be awesome (and more expensive) once the second phase is complete.", "Date": "July 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SF Bay Area", "Title": "\u201cParadise Found - redefines excellence at Kaanapali\u201d", "Author": "MauiWowii", "ReviewID": "UR33755401", "Content": "Honua Kai is an incredible and new resort in north Kaanapali.

We had been planning a trip to Maui (3rd to the islands) for some time. I first read about the Honua Kai in the New York Times in January. It did not disappoint except for one little location issue. I booked an Ohana Oceanview room directly from the resort for a six night stay. The photos the resort has on flickr were very helpful and accurrate. We were very happy with the room. The building that we stayed in is fully open with a small cafe/gourmet store, a small but adequate fitness room, and one pool (two more under construction). The major construction of building #2 is complete, so no major construction noise...they are just working on the interiors. We actually forgot that there was a construction zone near by. The room was amazing and very luxurious, and we might have been the first to stay in it. The Ohana room is large with tile, marble and all the appliances you could need, including a front-loading stackable washer and dryer. This room is great for couples, or families with one small child (there is a pull out sofa bed that looked great.) The main bed was very comfortable. You can order breakfast and lunch items from the 'Aina store in the lobby, but we went off property to some great little restraunts for all our meals. We essentially followed the dining recommendations from \"Maui Revealed,\" and those recommendations were very accurate. The beach at the resort is very calm, which is nice since the pool was a let down. It's great if you have kids, but very shallow and not very big (which should change once the other two pools open up). There are some reefs and rocks at most points on the beach in front of the resort, but it is great for snorkling. I snorkled all the way down to the Westin Kaanapali Villas and saw some sea turtles. Great walking beach, too. It is just up from the Black Rock and Main Kaanapali resort area, so it is close to many things to do. The service from the concierge, front desk and bell staff was excellent. Tim at the front desk was especially helpful. Our only problem was that housekeeping would NOT replace the most basic items. Nightly, we had to call down for shampoo and soap, as well as toilet paper and kleenex when we ran out of those. Within minutes of us raising this issue with the front desk, the items were always delivered and apology provided. So, no major issue, but it was odd and got annoying after the third+ time. The only real caveat is the odor from the West Maui Water Treatment plant. Let me start by saying that you can't smell anything while in the resort, i.e. in the lobby or in the pool / main courtyard. However, you can clearly smell it in the parking lot. It's a trade-off and something to consider. We might stay elsewhere if we return, but we didn't mind it too much while there, nor was it a major issue. We drove by all the other major Maui resort areas, Kapalua, Kaanapali, Wailea, and stayed in Wailea for our last three nights. Wailea was the best resort area in our opinion, but its hard to be unhappy in any of them. This is a great resort to use as a base from which to explore all the wonders of Maui.

The hotel is stunning. The beach is closer than it appears in the website photos, you can hear the waves crash on the beach from the rooms. The landscaping is lovely, including a koi pond that is surrounded by beautiful patio seating. The pool is large and there are two hot tubs which are open until 10pm (at night the tiki torches surround the pool and gounds). I loved the location, it is an easy 20 minute walk to Black Rock along a direct boardwalk & paths. The beach in front of the Honua Kai is pristine and there are very few people who hang out there. If you walk 50 towards Kaanapali you can enter the ocean on the sand and swim. Otherwise, there are low rocks and reefs right in front that make it difficult to swim without a snorkel mask. However, the snorkeling is really good. I would recommend bringing your own snorkel set or renting a set for a week from the Maui Dive Shop (many locations inc. Whalers Village) as the Honua Kai rental rates were way too high. The staff were so friendly, especially the greeters who stand outside the lobby. Everyone was so nice and happy. There is a small but very adequate gym and a kids area. Our room was a 2 bed/2 bath with a large patio. The furnishings and decor are modern & beautiful, the kitchen was gourmet and made eating-in a treat, and I haven't slept on such a comfortable bed in ages. I actually took a photo of the mattress label so that I could buy one when I got home! We had no problem with the construction noise but we did have a room looking into the center of the hotel & pool.. the rooms that face the second phase directly (on the outside North side) would not be great right now. We had such a great experience at Honua Kai that we will return this year and are considering purchasing a unit in the second phase. I wish the large gym and spa, which are in the second phase, were open but we look forward to experiencing them in the future.
