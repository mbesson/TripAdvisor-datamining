{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Terrific find in Tokyo This hotel is a terrific bargain in an expensive city. It's clean and attractive, with a small garden visible from the lobby. Rooms are small but not terrible by Japanese standards. Only a few blocks from the Yamanote Line so easy to get around the city. There are small restaurants and a grocery between the hotel and the station, and Ebisu is within walking distance. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR834922753", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Feistygal"}, {"Content": "Centrally located to station  This isn't going to be your Prince Hotel or a Hyatt. This is primarily a business hotel with businessmen staying to conduct business - it appears to attract a wide range of nationalities from Japanese businessmen to Koreans and European/Americans. The hotel is an older hotel - it's immaculately kept but the benefit of the older hotel is that it has rooms that are larger than the standard Japanese hotel that was built in the 80s and 90s where the room is barely big enough to open up your suitcase (i.e. Washington Hotel or some of the Prince Hotels).Location wise, it's in a quiet area but within a 3 minute walk of the Meguro JR station. It's got a beautiful garden with a koi pond in the lobby that is also very nice. Nothing fancy but a good base from where to travel. There's a supermarket up the street and a convenience store that's across the street for your munchies and the room has a refrigerator to put your goodies.For the price, it's a decent hotel with clean rooms and showers. I'd forego the breakfast or the breakfast package - even for me being Japanese, I was sorely disappointed by the choices for breakfast which consisted of a large tureen of miso soup, some cubes of cold tofu, seaweed, cold egg omelet and pickles. The western side fared even worse with not even a toaster and some stale rolls, runny eggs and what passees for ham in Japan. Give it a pass for the $15 for breakfast and go down the street and get yourself a breakfast at a coffee shop near the station.", "Date": "May 31, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR674370727", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Spahkee"}, {"Content": "Tr\u732bs bien situ\u8305 mais \u813f r\u8305noover   showReview(21662524, 'full');", "Date": "Nov 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR190667346", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ScootR47"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066854-d505872-r4344176-Princess_Garden-Shinagawa_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "505872", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
