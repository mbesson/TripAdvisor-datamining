Many of my clients ask about the Andrew Jackson Hotel and I tell them the little I know. I have never been inside the this hotel so I am limited on what I can tell my guests. On one of my few days off I was at the vet across the street waiting for appointment with my wife and the vet was running late. I thought I could take this time and check out the Andrew Jackson Hotel. I walked in and said hello. The desk clerk flashed me a nasty look and was even more rude with his verbal tone. I ignore all this and told him my reason for my visit. He refused to tell me his rates, refused to tell me anything about the hotel, I went to peek at the courtyard in the back and he yelled at me and told me to get out. If this was not weird enough, I called and e-mailed the manager to complain about the horrible experience. If I owned a buisness I would like to know if this type of thing goes on. I did not get any reponse. On my third call the manager he was in and I explained what I experienced and everything was going fine and the issue was almost over, then Mark started to tell me he could not figure out who was working the front desk yesterday at 3:30 PM and even if he could \"there is always two sides to every story\". When he started this speal I lost my temper. Who has ever heard in this day in age when a manager of a big hotel in a major tourist town has no Conflict Resolution Skills? (Manager. If you did not care, which i think is crazy.) Lets just say that not caring is actually acceptable. All you need to say is \"thank you for your concern. I will look into this and I assure you I will deal with it.\" Then ask me about something personel; such as \"Do you enjoy being a tour guide?, How did you fare with the hurricane?, Ready for summer to be done?\" Then the call is done and I am happy. Why would you bring up there is two sided to any story even if your thinking it. You just called me a liar. Why would I call you if it was not true. Read some of these reviews and there is tone of people calling the desk clerk rude. Should we post a reponse that they are all liars. No wonder why there is always a vacancy sign up even during Mardi Gras season. I take over 10 thousand tourist by this place every year. I told more than 9 buggy drivers about my expeirence. That is over 100,000 tourist that will not be told anything about the Andrew Jackson Hotel.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Location": "5", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sarasota", "Title": "\u201cGreat room at a great price!\u201d", "Author": "Pam C", "ReviewID": "UR138802483", "Content": "I used to stay at the Andrew Jackson hotel all the time when I was younger however it seemed like every time I wanted to stay there in recent years it was always booked up. Finally got a chance to take my husband there this past weekend. We paid a little extra for a room with a balcony and it was well worth it! The price we paid was about the price we would pay for a simple room with no balcony anywhere else in the French Quarter. Yes, the hotel is older... and hence there are things that need to be repaired. I'm sure they have a running list at all times. We loved the history behind the place ourselves. The room was clean and the hotel is SO close to anything and everything. It had a small 19\" TV but we weren't there to watch TV. The bathroom looked like it had been updated recently. The staff.. Well, they are a little rough around the edges. The guy that worked pretty much the whole time we were there was pretty good once we buttered him up a bit but the guy that took his place on Monday did not have a bit of personality. We didn't want or need much so it didn't really matter to us at all. Hurricane Isaac was coming in the day we were leaving and friends of mine were forced to leave and I'm sure he could have made it more pleasant for them. I would reccomend this place to anyone that really wants to \"experience\" New Orleans. If you are a chain hotel type of person then don't go here, actually for that matter, you may not want to go to New Orleans.

This is lovely historic building has been lovingly decorated 'New Orleans' style. The colour of the building and paintwork is what first attracted me to it. Being a couple of streets away from the main French Quarter, it is close (and safe) enough to walk, but far enough away that you don't hear the late night music and activities. The only drawback for us is that we were travelling around the States with two big heavy suitcases. Our room was located outside, up the external staircase. My partner, who is 63, had to carry both suitcases up the stairs, then down again at the end of our stay. It would have been a nice touch if the man at reception had offered to help. We didn't realise that breakfast was included until the last day - just as we were leaving! We weren't told.

As our friend says below, we were definitely pleasantly surprised. We had an upstairs, courtyard room. Our room was definitely spacious enough for our needs (sleeping & getting ready to wander about the French Quarter) and they were very clean. I wasn't expecting The Ritz for the price we paid and I was prepared for the lack of parking because of the reviews posted, so no surprises there. The hotel is old - built in 1888. If you want new or want something fancy, go somewhere else and pay more. Of course, you won't have authenticity or be as close to all the fun. The only complaints I have about my room are: 1) the bathroom was small and it was difficult to shower without hitting your elbows on the walls repeatedly and 2) you could hear every noise in the courtyard. Late Friday night/Saturday morning (Feb 24/25), while we were trying to sleep, some loud, drunk people were talking to someone on the cell phone with the SPEAKER TURNED ON. If you are reading this review, please tell the person on the other end of the phone that we miss her too, as you apparently wanted everyone in the hotel to hear the entire conversation. The courtyard itself was adorable. My husband and I grabbed a coffee at Community Coffee on the corner, came back and just sat there together for a bit before starting the day. The staff at the hotel was friendly, helping us get a parking space at the sister hotel, suggesting places for breakfast, and always ready to help answer any questions we had. Our friend posted below about our \"encounters\" with whatever it was. She did forget to mention the tapping I felt on the mattress next to my head. I asked my husband what he was doing. He said he wasn't doing anything and when he moved his hands, I realized they were on my leg. I look forward to our next visit and hope to get the chance to stay here again.

I selected it based on photos and reviews on the site and the Andrew Jackson website. I confirmed the room shortly after buying the deal and again a few days before my departure. They were very friendly and courteous. The exterior was charming and the hotel's location was perfect: close to attractions and public transportation, and just far enough from Bourbon Street to limit the noise. Their sister hotel, about 3 blocks away, had 2 small pools, which we were permitted to use. Our room was another matter and a huge disappointment. The door opened off the marble floored hallway that led from the lobby to the courtyard rooms. This door was the only ventilation for our room, as the bathroom window was painted shut and there was no bathroom fan. The lone AC vent did not offer any relief and a couple of nights we slept with the door ajar, on its little safety chain, because the hallway was dramatically cooler. This lack of AC and ventilation is why there was so much mold on the tub's surround. The bedspreads were cute, but the rest of the room was dismal. No real decor (undersized and mismatched garage sale pictures) and there was some sort of storage area or utility access bulkhead with doors that jutted out about 3' and stretched across much of the room. A tall dresser (not an antique and not charming) prevented the bathroom door from opening all the way and the closet was small and oddly shaped. The bachelor party occupying the remaining rooms off the interior hallway woke us up repeatedly for two nights in a row. Suitcases rolling down the hall between the lobby and the courtyard rooms beat a loud and reverberating cadence, followed by the slamming of the exterior door that was adjacent to our door. The reverse order was repeated for early morning departures. The chandelier above the doors shone brightly through the glass top of our door (which did not open for ventilation), despite a cheap mini-blind installed obviously to block it. The continental breakfast was a thermos of coffee and a box of donuts in the lobby. One morning there was a selection of small cereal boxes on the sideboard. I poked my head into a courtyard room one morning, while the maid was cleaning. Much nicer, with 2 big beds and cuter decor. Don't know if the AC was any better.

Very informative and very proud of their property and the history it represents. Yes, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are smaller, but they are adeqaute, clean, and serve their purpose. We came to the French Quarter to celebrate our anniversary, so we didn't plan on spending alot of time in a room anyway, however when we were there, everything was fine. We had a problem with the bed the first night we were there, and after reporting it in the morning to the front desk it was quickly resolved by replacing it with a new bed. We have traveled extensively and stayed at many 5 star resorts and hotels, and had slower service with mixed results. Not here, the staff bent over backwards to make sure our stay was satisfactory. If anything could be improved, it would be the breakfast. Coffee and dougnuts and some cold cereal, but then again, you're in New Orleans and the Cafe Du'Mond is only a short two block walk away and a diner just around the corner serves 24 hour breakfast at very reasonable rates (around $6 for a full breakfast). All told, it was a great stay. The location is the best, we parked our car when we arrived and never went back to it until we left. Everything was in walking distance. When we return to New Orleans, we will stay here again.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "northern virginia", "Title": "\u201chappy camper!\u201d", "Author": "tevagrrrl", "ReviewID": "UR99014801", "Content": "my friend & i met up in new orleans for a long weekend in the french quarter. we are a couple of old girls that enjoy good food as well as casual, relaxing evenings. we wanted to stay somewhere convenient to good restaurants, that was pleasant & had french quarter character. we got just what we needed at the andrew jackson hotel! our room was comfy & clean. right outside our room was a sweet & cozy courtyard with the occasional neighborhood cat passing through...perfect for chilling out with a glass of wine while resting our feet. last, but not at all least...the staff! they were awesome! they made us feel like we were staying with family!", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Ridgeville, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cA good joint.\u201d", "Author": "Ironchefmeister", "ReviewID": "UR93749472", "Content": "Its in a great location just down the road from the crazy part of the French Quarter so its quiet but still within walking distance to everything.

This hotels days should be numbered and they have limited parking so eventhough it is advertised with free parking, I guarantee you will not get free parking and when you find a parking spot you will have to walk 7 blocks to get back to the room.

(please check my other reviews). My wife & I really wanted to stay at this hotel, instead of a chain hotel. I called the hotel on Dec. 26th to confirm my reservation of a double bed room. The staff said my reservation was fine. I told the staff we would arrive at 10:00 p.m. on Dec. 29th. The moment we checked in there was a problem. The staff told us the heat was broken in our double bed room. (the hotel web site states that the rooms are heated, it was 40 degree weather). I was told they were working on fixing it. Fine, we took a single bed room, our friend was not arriving until the next day. The next morning my wife asked about our double bed room. My wife was shown a double bed room and the front desk clerk stated the maid needed to clean the room first, then it would be ready for us. We went to breakfast, then returned to the hotel an hour later. Upon arriving, the same desk clerk informed us that we could not have the room. When we asked why, we were told we had to call Travelocity, since we did not have a contract with the hotel. My wife asked if their sister hotel St. Pierre had any double bed rooms. The clerk said no. In all the years and places I have travelled, I have never heard of being shown a room, then told I could not have it. Usually, if there is a problem, guests are upgraded, not downgraded. There was no physical way 3 grown adults could even fit into the small single bed they gave us the night before. I called my credit card company with whom I reserved the room with. After they contacted the hotel, they told me to check the hotel St. Pierre. My wife & I walked 3 blocks to that hotel. They indeed had \"2\" double bed rooms available (we were just told by Andrew Jackson Hotel staff there were no rooms available). We stayed at hotel St. Pierre until 12/1/08. Please read my review of that hotel. To be fair to the Andrew Jackson hotel, I emailed the G.M. after we returned home, asking why we could not have a double bed room that we had reserved. He replied that he was \"vaguely familiar with the situation\" and that he would get back with me. I never heard from him again. My credit card company contacted the hotel & the G.M. stated he would resolve the situation with me personally. When I told the credit card company he had not gotten back with me, they contacted him again. The G.M. told the credit card company that the hotel server crashed and he had no information about what happened during my stay. He offered me a 2 free night stay at the hotel. I declined. Why would I go back to this hotel? First my room wasnt available, then it was available, then after it was shown to us, it wasn't available. Their sister hotel had no double rooms available, then it had 2, but the one room with heat (in 40 degree weather) was an extra charge of $20 a night? It has taken me over 1 month to get this situation resolved & I still have no explanation of what happened.

Our only issue was that the carpet seemed a bit sticky, so we just kept on some type of shoes. Not a real issue. The location is FANTASTIC! We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.

I was told I would receive an email confirmation of my reservations, but I never received any email from the hotel. Upon checking in, I had to present my credit card. I used my BankOne debit card which also serves as a Visa credit card. I was charged for the full room price plus $30 for using a debit card. I was unaware of this $30 charge, because it was not explained or even mentioned to me. I signed the paper agreeing to pay the full amount. When I checked my bank balance the next day, this amount had been taken out. I then realized I was not given a receipt for signing, only my two room keys. Upon attempting to check out, the woman ran my debit card again without asking me for my card, because she already had the card numbers in her system. I was this time charged for the full room price, minus the $30 debit card fee. At no point during check in or check out or my visit was I informed they would run my card twice for whatever reason. When she presented me with the card receipt to sign, I asked her if I hadn't already signed one when I checked in. She said yes but this was the real charge. She then informed me the first money debited from my account was being \"held\" or \"frozen\" then told me I could call my bank with my receipt information to have them release the first charge from the hotel so I could have the money back in my account. I asked her to clarify why they were double charging me, and she said they were not. However, I had already signed two debit card receipts at this point and had her tell me I would have to call my bank. I didn't understand how this could not be double charging, so I asked for her to explain again. She attempted twice, and the first explanation sounded as if the money from my account was just being held and when this authorization went through, it would be released to them. Upon further questioning, the woman said it was being held by the bank but this charge would be taken also and I would have to still get my first amount of money back somehow. It was during this I was told that I had incurred a $30 charge for using a debit card the first time. The second receipt did not include this charge, and I was not told if it was still going to be taken from the account or anything. I finally just took my receipt and left in utter confusion. I still do not understand any of their logic as it seems to change every moment. The room was expensive enough with all of its problems then to have to deal with this issue was ridiculous. Please see below for a list of room problems. I was also charged $1.50 for long distance telephone charges when checking out. The phone number was a toll free 800 number. The hotel also employs false advertising. On their website, the hotel is shown in the pictures as white. The hotel is actually yellow. There were no hair dryers in the room, I do not know if you had to ask for one or not. There is also a promise of \"Lush and Beautiful Gas-Lit French Quarter Courtyard with Exquisite Fountains.\" There was one fountain, and no evidence of gas lights anywhere. Parking was also an issue. I was told there was limited self parking at their sister hotel, the St. Pierre at 911 Burgundy Street. When I asked where to park, I was told that the St. Pierre's lot was full and I would have to go elsewhere. Room Problems: Fire sprinkler on western wall was painted over. Electrical outlet on western wall do not work. Mirror on northern wall was not firmly attached to wall and wobbled at slightest disturbance.

This was my 20th anniversary and I was assured that this would be a great room overlooking the street. Room greeted us with beer can and cigarette butts on the balcony. Room was so filthy that I requested new sheets. Take off your shoes and the socks turned black INSTANTLY. The next morning painting and wallpapering took place.. called three times in advance never told about this. Did move to sister hotel which was slightly better, BUT only slightly. Shower terrible, bathroom door didn't close..the only relief we got from the room was when we left. Thank goodness New Orleans was great -this place is the worst!", "Date": "April 25, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Andrew Jackson Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60864-d281614-Reviews-Andrew_Jackson_Hotel-New_Orleans_Louisiana.html", "Price": "$120 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">919 Royal Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New Orleans</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">LA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">70116</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "281614", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/47/88/4788e5fbb23065b0f1263044a2fd19601large.jpg"}}
