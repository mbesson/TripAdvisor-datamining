We were assured this room would be quiet but It was so incredibly noisy with cars, trucks,scooters and police/ambulance sirens screaming by all night that sleep was impossible.Also parking costs 30 Euros per night and as there is no parking allowed in this area there is no alternative to paying this fee if you have a car. It would have been nice to be told about that at the time of booking.There is no meal service at this hotel so it is necessary to make other arrangements for breakfast.Even though the rooms are nice and the hotel is central it is just not worth the price for such an uncomfortable and ultimately expensive experience.Very very disappointing.", "Date": "Jul 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR120577680", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "JGSRichards"}, {"Content": "excelente-magnifico       Ba\u5e3do", "Date": "Apr 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR308550824", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "JoseLG"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d944682-r20404646-Firenze_Suite-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "944682", "Price": "$273"}}
