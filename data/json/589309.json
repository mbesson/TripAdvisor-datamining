While still in the timeframe where I could cancel, we had a change in plans so I contacted the the hotel directly to cancel the reservation. When I called, their answer was \"hello?\". Not \"Thank you for calling Knights Inn LA\" or any indication that I had reached a business. I had to confirm that it was in fact the Knights Inn. I then asked her to cancel the reservation. She asked me what the arrival date was and when I told her she said \"did you book this on your own?\". I told her that yes, I booked online, and she then refused to even try to look up my reservation. She said I could cancel online. I wasn't near a computer, and just wanted to cancel it through her. She would not. I found this terribly rude and inconvenient. I manage a hotel myself and was appalled by this customer service. I am glad we didn't have to actually stay there after the way they handled their cancellations.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Darlington, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAnts in Bathroom\u201d", "Author": "Catherine W", "ReviewID": "UR119477848", "Content": "The hotel is drab and dull and there were ants in the bathroom.

The lady running the front desk is out DOING LAUNDRY. I end up having to wait half an hour before the lady comes back. Meanwhile, while the lady is gone, the maintenance decides to wash his face with the hose, leaving a stream of water, MAKING MY LUGGAGE WET. The lady comes back and is very rude and does not even apologize for being late (Perhaps because she appeared to know NO ENGLISH). Throws me my room key and then disappears. I enter the room to the dismay of NO TOILET PAPER, A TREE IN MY WINDOW, and UNMADE BEDS. The TV WAS BROKEN TOO. Despite all this, I paid for it so I decided to give it a try. At night, I was sleeping and was awoken first by BED BUGS. It was really itchy. The second time I woke up, some locals arguing and FIGHTING outside my window. Two GUNSHOTS sounded. I decided it was my best hope to sleep under the bed. When I was under the bed, there were ANTS. Really annoyed and sleepy, I decided to wake myself up in the shower. When I turned on the bathroom light (it took 5 minutes to turn on), there was a LOUD BUZZING SOUND. I turned on the water, and a jet of BROWN water came out. There were also COCKROACHES in the bathtub. I left the bathroom and went and tried to use the internet to the dismay that THE INTERNET DISCONNECTED EVERY FIVE MINUTES. I ended up falling asleep IN THE CLOSET with towels and bug repellent on the floor. When I woke up, I felt really NAUSEOUS. I decided some of the free breakfast would cheer me up. I went to find the breakfast room and found MOLDY BREAD and INSECTS in the cereal. In addition, there were HALF EMPTY cups. At that point, I had enough (and I have a very high tolerance for hotels), I left without caring about the other three nights I had booked. I had enough and I was out. Don't make the same mistake I did and waste several hundred dollars on this hotel.

I stayed in the hotel on 20, 21 and 25 in Dec, 2007. I saw a complain even on the first day (20,Dec) when I was checking in: A room was open when the guest went out (he locked the door). The front desk explained that maybe the cleaning person forget to close the door after the room service. Unfortunately I did not pay too much attention on it since I was thinking about to find a place to eat and shop. I went out with my GPS and had a dinner nearby (less than 2 hours for sure about 5pm to 7pm) at. The next morning after taking the breakfast in the hotel (first floor), I packed my luggage to go to the tourist site and found out my laptop and digital camera were gone. At the first thought, I had thought I was stolen in the morning. But finally found out they were gone in the previous night because my laptop, camera and GPS were put together but the GPS was not stolen. They take my laptop and camera on the first when I moved in but did not take my laptop case so that I even did not realize it was gone. Furthermore, the service there is very poor too and the front desks are very rude. All the guests (mainly from China) in this hotel were arranged by the tourist agent (sea gull group) and they knew few about this hotel till moved in. I communicated with them, most of them were complaining the trip too.
