However, there were a couple of negatives which I will get out of the way first. We booked direct with the hotel online and took advantage of a 'special' advance booking deal. I was a bit miffed to find that, after paying over 30 days ahead, that the prices subsequently dropped significantly due to a cancellation. We paid nearly 30% more than the later price, but were happily rewarded with a slightly better room after e-mailing the hotel. The second negative is the price of food and drink. We paid \u20ac9.50 for a bottle of mineral water which is steep in any country. Thankfully, these were the only bad points and the splendid staff and attention to details more than made up for the niggles. Our room as on the second floor overlooking an inner courtyard which, although wasn't a great view, it was blissfully quiet. Decor in the room and throughout the hotel is opulent, yet slightly 'corporate'. There seems to be quite a high number of business customers, but as it is surrounded by embassies, it's no surprise. Check-in of luggage was seamless and bags were taken and reappeared in our room on our arrival. All staff at reception spoke faultless English and the number of 'Greeters' was quite overwhelming. Bar staff were charming and efficient. Location is spectacular, with the Brandenberg date, literally a stone's throw away. The hotels right on Unter Den Linden, the main road into the city centre and shops and restaurants abound in nearby Friedrichstrasse. The Reichstag is just around the corner, through the gate and the pretty Tiergarten is a few metres away. We would recommend taking a tour bus on day one to orientate oneself as it's a large, but walkable city with many of the sights and museums in the centre around the hotel. We would certainly recommend the Adlon for a truly first-class stay, but be aware \u2013 it's not cheap", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm", "Title": "\u201cWOW\u201d", "Author": "Sven A", "ReviewID": "UR127664068", "Content": "Stayed for just a night for a quick stopover in Berlin and am totally impressed.

And the movie star tag sync'd very nicely with this hotel as we soon found out when we checked in. Excellent front of house culture, pristine lobbies and meals areas. The location is a real winner, literally at the foot of the Brandenburg gate, providing not only exceptional viewing, but in addition the opportunity for early morning walks or runs around the gate and the surrounding gardens. The cafe in front of the hotel also provides the opportunity to sit and take in the passing world with magnificent views, whilst sipping on your favourite hot or cold beverage. Our room was wonderful, twin balconies providing a third floor overview of the gate and surrounding areas. Old world in style, but still with all the mod cons you need. Huge bathroom with the suite as well as a large entry foyer. - Very \"Grand\" in terms of style. We would have to say that the breakfast was one of the best we have ever had anywhere. \"snappy service\" is also a standard feature of the breakfast experience. It wasn't just the range and quality of the food that made it so good, but the attention to detail with what you ordered was of note. - They went out of their way to make sure you got what you wanted the way you wanted it. Breakfast is served in either an airy atruim area, or the restaurant at the front of the building. Depending on usage requirements. - There was a large group staying when we were there and they were allocated the atrium for breakfast. The vast lobby lends itself to a variety of areas for sitting, eating and also relaxing in the bar. Nice layout with a good look and feel to it.

He took care of the luggage and accompanied me to the reception. A friendly young man checked me in and even upgraded me to a nice Junior Suite. A Russian hostess brought me to my room and showed me the amenities. Some people may like this but I personally find this a touch too much as she was talking all the way not realizing I was just tired and not in the mood to chat. Luggage was delivered promptly. The suite was very clean and on the 4th floor on the backside of the hotel (very quiet). Nothing was missing really except for international power plugs and maybe a larger TV in the living room (only 32in). The bed was very comfortable and I had a good night's sleep. A nice feature in the shower stall is a steambath which you need to turn on about 10mins before you want to enjoy it. The amenities are of very good quality and the bathtub has jets. Very nice.

My gay male cousin was staying on a different floor. In a town where almost everything is \"alternative\" (as Berliners like to call themselves and their city instead of grungy, vanguard, etc.) this place is a bation of bourgeois more suited to Munich or Frankfurt. The location is great, central and amid all the sights. The lobby is nice, traditional but not distinctive. Front desk service is friendly and competent. The room was spacious enough, except that it looked into a courtyard where the hotel employees came to take their cigarette breaks. But hey, I'm all for people watching and workers having breaks. The bathroom and amenities were cool. They had the bubble bath for the tub in a little honey pot, too cute! However, housekeeping wasn't that great. I stayed from a Tuesday through the week-end. On no night except on Friday (when the hotel gets crowded with locals either with wives or girlfriends) was the bed turned down. I thought, this being Berlin turn down service must've been too bourgeois :) of an expectation. But it had been offered regularly once I checked, although for some reason not in my room. Also, the bottled water wasn't replenished regularly or consistently. I called and asked for flat water, but got fizzy instead. I called back but never received any. Finally, I had to take it from the mini-bar. Annoying when the place is 5 stars, charges as such and the water is supposed to be complimentary. I guess if I had complained, they would've rectified the matter, but it just wasn't worth it. Upon my return they sent a survery to a \"Mr.\" I completed it, letting them know that I was a female and had stayed not for a single night but a week. No reply back.

We choose this hotel because of its affiliation to the LHW Leaders Club and because of it's reputation and history. Indeed we imagined this hotel as being Germany's landmark property. The hotel is nicely located just on the Pariser Platz facing the Brandenburger Tor. Location is certainly one of the hotel highlights. Upon arrival: check-in was friendly and efficient. The lobby and lounge area are a little dark and and feel a little crowded. We took lunch in the lobby bar. Typical hotel choices like Burgers, Club Sandwiches and some specialties. Food was decently priced, drinks a little overpriced (7\u20ac for some water). Thnx to my Leaders Club membership we were upgraded to a superior room. The room was nice; yet don't expect antique furniture or belle epoch appliances. The room feels very much like a 5* chain room or like on a cruise ship: very much interchangeable and nothing that underlines the hotel's history or heritage. It could have been in Hong Kong, Frankfurt or Washington. Same in the bathroom: elegant luxury yet again: nothing charming or with personality. The hotel gave us a leaders club welcome gift that consisted of some fruits and some hang made chocolate: again very nice yet nothing German or berlin-like. Sleep quality was okay. Cleanliness was obviously excellent, just like in the rest of the hotel. The spa area is standard for a 5* euro-city property: a little indoor pool, some canvas chairs and a sauna and steam room area. Again nothing to write home about yet does the job. We were given complimentary continental breakfast: service was slow and breakfast room was rather crowded and busy: yet still enjoyable. A highlight about the breakfast room is the view towards the Brandenburger Tor. The continental breakfast was a nice typical German selection of vienoiseries and bakeries, ham and jelly, some cheese and some cold cuts. All in all a nice hotel, very friendly staff on a great location yet without any particular charm or personality: it feels like a chain hotel and not at all like Berlin's landmark property. To compare this hotel to the other Berlin LHW properties: yes it is better than the Berlin Kempinski Hotel Bristol. But there are much more charming alternatives like the Schlosshotel im Grunewald or the Hotel de Rome. I would probably choose a different property on my next Berlin visit. +location +staff -value for money -interchangeable property", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWe got engaged in this Berlin hotel. Most romantic, festive, beautiful and elegant hotel I have ever stayed in.\u201d", "Author": "StephanieFrasco", "ReviewID": "UR122392520", "Content": "I entered this hotel as a girlfriend and I left as a Fianc\u00e9. What more can I say. Our three night trip over the Christmas Holiday was the best vacation I have ever experienced. I love this hotel and want to come back year after year. We probably will. First of all my boyfriend and I met in Berlin and coming to this hotel after being absent from Berlin for 2 years was quite the treat. For those of you who don't know Berlin is an amazing city that is torn between a few personalities. One side is artsy, another entrepreneurial, and another elegant. In other words there is something for everyone in Berlin. That is what makes it so magical. The elegant side I hadn't seen before and because we stayed in Berlin at the Adlon I love Berlin even more than I ever did before. THE HOTEL: It was christmas and the entire place was decorated to the nines. It was elegant and classy with a large sitting area in the center of the hotel where guests gathered over beverages, snacks and tea. I loved sitting in this area. You can people watch, admire the sights of the hotel and just take it all in. THE ROOM We were upgraded to the nicest room I have ever stayed in, (and we travel alot). It was a 3 bedroom suite. The bed was super comfortable and the room as a whole was super high tech. You can control all the lights from the bed area so you don't have to get out of bed to turn them off. Of course you can control them from other places in the room as well. I am a big bath person and the bathtub was super. The bubble bath was in a honey bottle which was cute as well. The shower was also amazing!! There was a vanity seat so I can blow dry my hair and do my makeup sitting down. Such a luxury. There was also a walk in closet that would make any girl cry! The sitting room was also nicely decorated with high class touches, but nothing was over done. It was just right. THE STAFF They are the nicest people ever. I even gave one of them a hug! Definitely make you feel like you are welcomed as their personal guest. 10 thumbs up for the staff. The LOCATION You can't get a better location that the Brandenburg gate. It is the entrance to the city. There is an S bahn and a Ubahn outside the hotel as well. Many of the most famous sites are also walking distance. Best location in berlin! WIFI! As my fiance and I travel alot for work we have to have consistent internet. The Adlon provides free wireless internet throughout the whole hotel! it always worked and was fast! I love you Adlon for this! FOOD Nothing beats a German breakfast and this one is top notch. Literally I have never seen so many jams and jellys provided or so many choices of meats, cheeses, breads, etc. at a breakfast buffet before. We also had english tea there which was wonderful and we ordered room service. All the food was great. Overall I felt like Pretty Woman while in this hotel.

Our stay was absolutely unforgettable! I actually chose this hotel as the location for my proposal to my girlfriend (now fianc\u00e9) and I am SO HAPPY I did. The Professional Staff There are so many amazing things about the Adlon Hotel, but it all begins and ends with their charming, professional, and uber helpful staff. Every single person working at this hotel is on his or her \"A Game\" every single day. Before our stay, I booked the reservation directly on their website and added flowers, champagne, and limousine airport pick-up service. Then, I contacted the hotel staff by email to let them know about my marriage proposal plans to see if they could assist in co-ordinating the details so I could make my proposal as spectacular as possible. From the very first email (and the 10 or so messages that followed) the staff was AMAZINGLY HELPFUL and treated me like a VIP guest. I want to give specific thanks to Paula Lena Lensch and Susanne Exl -- both from the reservations (\"behind the scenes\") staff who helped me make everything happen. Also, the lady who checked us in and the gentleman who guided us to our room both did an outstanding job. I simply cannot thank these people enough for their creativity and their helpfulness. THANK YOU SO MUCH! Upon arriving on our flight to the Berlin airport, our driver was waiting at the very front of the passenger exit door from the luggage claim. He was immediately very friendly and carried our luggage to the car. While driving to the hotel, he provided really insightful comments about Berlin and the sights as we passed them. Very informative guy! Once we arrived to the hotel, we felt immediately like royalty. If you've never seen the Adlon Hotel, it's located right on Pariser Platz next to the Brandenburg Gate. As our German friends put it so well, staying at the Adlon Hotel is like staying at the White House. You feel like a royal guest and a diplomatic figure of international importance all at once! The front desk staff checked us in speedily and treated us like old friends. They upgraded our room and took us directly upstairs. We always felt like they knew us and we'd stayed there many times before! Our Immaculate Suite What can I say? Our room #508 was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! This two-room suite looks out directly to the Brandenburg Gate and, since it was Christmas time, the beautiful Christmas tree and menorah out in the open square of Pariser Platz. We also had a direct view of the United States Embassy near the Brandenburg Gate. Our suite included a beautifully decorated entry way, full-size living room, large bedroom, walk-in closet, and full-size bathroom. We've stayed in lots of hotels all over the world -- and many of them very nice as well -- but nothing compares to the room we had at the Adlon. We will never forget it! The Cozy Lobby Area While staying at the hotel, we took advantage of the charming & cozy lobby area many times. We enjoyed coffees, wines, beers, and even the famous \"Afternoon Tea at Adlon\" experience. Everything was delicious and carefully prepared. The staff were all incredibly nice and helpful all day and all night long. Despite working during the Christmas holiday, everyone did an exceptional job and made us feel comfortable and welcome every single minute. Bravo! Even if you never stay at the Adlon Hotel, I highly recommend just stopping in to enjoy some wonderful people watching in the lobby area. Worth every euro! Location, Location, Location One factor that really makes the Adlon Hotel so ideal for staying in Berlin is its location. Sure, maybe other hotels offer similar access to the sights -- maybe some are even better located for that purpose. But I can't stress this enough -- staying at the Adlon is like staying at the Buckingham Palace. You just feel part of everything in a very special way. Near to the hotel, we easily found nice shops, cafes, and restaurants to enjoy. This place has it all! And you never get tired of looking at the Brandenburger Tor. Wireless Internet Wifi is really important to us when we travel. The wireless Internet at Adlon was reliable, easy-to-use, and widely available. And... it's FREE! The Epitome of \"Grand Hotel Luxury\" What more to say? I love grand hotels, and I've stayed at some really great places, but NOTHING tops the Adlon in these terms. When Lorenz Adlon created this grand palace, he wanted to make sure the guests felt exceptionally important but also right at home. That's a rare combination and this hotel pulls it off in spades. It's grand luxury at its finest without all the pretentious side-effects. If you love grand hotels and you're planning a trip to Berlin, there are simply no other options.

So many museums! So classy and such good taste. Not snobby at all. Very friendly staff, always ready to help. The buffet breakfast at 39 euros per person had everything one could want, a huge varied fare of very good quality. Just for a change we went to Caf\u00e9 Einstein, on the right after leaving the hotel, and it was really good too but at half the price of Adlon\u2019s but at Adlon there is so much luxury and service that we just had to have our meals there. The room was spacious and there was a beautiful shower. Luxury bathroom products as is to be expected. Only thing we found strange was that there was nobody who would come in the evenings to turn down the bed for the night and with a little chocolate or something. This is what normally happens at this type of hotel but to tell you the truth, we were quite happy with that. Sometimes we find this a little bit too much, depending on our moods. Wonderfully placed so close to the Brandenburg Gate and if you get to the dining room early, (it opens at 6) you can enjoy your breakfast in such an idyllic setting, looking at the Brandenburg Gate just in front of you with nobody on the road. Bliss. The personnel catered to our every needs. There were quite a few receptions going on at the far end of the hotel and unfortunately it was here that we took the lift to get to our room faster. Due to this, we were not allowed to cross over to the far end and had to take another direction to get to our room. But this was not a big problem. There is a small room downstairs where you can smoke but it\u2019s preferable to go outside as even though it\u2019s aired, it\u2019s quite smoky in there. Internet was free. Didn\u2019t have time to use the spa or the pool. Buy a Berlin Card public transport ticket to take you everywhere without the bother of always looking for change. You just hop on and hop off any bus, tram or tube. My husband got stopped once (but not me even though we were together) by a security guard at the entrance who wasn\u2019t very tactful or gentle in his way. I didn\u2019t like that at all. Lots of tourist traps as with everywhere. 2 euros, fixed price, to be photographed next to the \u201csoldiers\u201d, Checkpoint Charly, false Berlin wall stone \u2026..

Kudos to the Kempinski management for not giving in to this temptation. This hotel is just excellent in every respect and is improving further - e.g. the hotel spa is OK but nothing spectacular. Now there is a day spa in the same building as the hotel that is really impressive - I am not sure if it actually belongs to the hotel, but it's worth booking a treatment just to soak in the atmoshere. Also, while not cheap, I think the Adlon is a very good value for money, considering this is the top hotel in an capital city. Compared to good hotel London or Paris prices, Adlon actually gives you a very decent deal on the same level of service. There is just one thing one needs to get used to: the entrance lobby area appears to be something of a magnet for a certain type of slightly upscale tourists who come in for a cup of coffee or just to have a look and make a few pictures. This makes the lobby always crowded and often noisy. However, all this stops few meters behind the lobby bar and the rest of the house is quite a bliss. Maybe the street visitors are the reason why Adlon recently introduced the institution of red-coated young women called \"guest relationship managers\" who hang around the lobby and appear to have no other task than to engage in small talk with arriving guests and help them with the check-in procedure. Since I feel like I am spending at least a third of my life in hotels, I am well able to check in on my own and when arriving at a hotel, my priority is to get the room key and to get the luggage delivered asap.

The front desk staff was was also very welcoming and the cleaning service did an excellent job. The room was very large and well-appointed. Actually, that's an understatement. The room was beautiful. Having each nightstand able to control all of the lights in the room was an excellent touch. The bed coverings were very comfortable and the bed itself was quite decent. I also found it extremely convenient that there were some plugs in the room that would accept US style chargers. I had travel adapters, but I tend to travel with a lot of gadgets, so this really helped out. There were also little touches to the room that were fantastic, such as an umbrella and a scale already in the closet. The location of the hotel was also superb. When you step outside you can see Brandenburg Tor a hundred meters or so away and you are surrounded by many restaurants. Right across from the rear of the hotel is more shops, more restaurants, and the Jewish memorial. Across the street from the hotel is also an extremely convenient bus line that stops at a number of the interesting places in Berlin and ends right in front of the Zoo. I will absolutely stay here again. I enjoyed this hotel greatly. There were a few small things that I think could be improved, but keep in mind that these are all fairly trivial. 1. The breakfast is far too expensive. I simply skipped breakfast each day when I was there, but I would have happily paid something like 20 euro. 40 euro is simply too expensive. 2. The surf and turf from the room service is quite disappointing in size. It was well prepared but for the cost (I think 40 euro?) it was a tiny tiny portion of meat and a claw from a tiny lobster. 3. It would be nice to have a power outlet very close to the nightstands. I use my cell phone as my alarm clock and I like to have it charging and next to me as I sleep. 4. The chair at the desk is reasonable, but could be more comfortable. I think a nice classic-looking executive chair would suit the room. 5. It would be nice to have an easy way to request what kind of water is left on the table when the room is cleaned. For example, I enjoy still water very much but do not enjoy sparkling water.

I booked a deluxe room, which was on the 3rd floor. The view from the window looked on to the building next door, although as this was a modern glass building it wasn't too bad. The room itself was very big, with the bathroom being the same size as many hotel rooms I've stayed in. There is a lengthy hallway, that has warbrobes on one side, that leads into the room itself. The room had a large bed, a work desk and some extra chairs next to the window. Flat screen TV was discreetly placed in a large cabinet next to the work desk. I had free wired internet connection, due to my GHA discovery member card, which was very fast and enabled me to watch my Sling Box with no issues.

For example, the person who escorted me to my room was a bit nervous, at times concierges seemed to be very busy and had little time to actually serve you - room smelled horrible. The contrast was huge when you entered to you room from the hallways which, like majority of 5-star properties, have a nice fragrance. I think the room I was staying can be given to both smokers and non-smokers. - the hotel has a nice sauna and pool area but it was very crowded as were the public spaces at times.

There are so many positives and superlatives that apply to this legend that I can only focus on a few, and to be fair, a few minor blemishes too. The location is as good as it gets. Sandwiched between the British and American embassies, directly outside the Brandenburg Gate this must be one of the choicest pieces of real estate in the world. The connections are superb too. If the S-Bahn stop \u201cBrandenburg Tor\u201d was any closer, you would be inside the hotel. There are always taxis and private BMW limousines waiting outside the front entrance. The doormen at the hotel are slick and professional. At the outset you need to be aware of the legendary status of this hotel. It is where royalty chooses to stay, along with Hollywood stars, billionaires, heads of state and other famous names. As a result, the doormen are constantly dealing with curious tourists and often need to firmly turn away unsuitable sticky beaks! The check in procedure is flawless, again with a degree of professionalism, warmth and knowledge that only rigorous training can bring. Checkout was equally impressive. English is easily and unhesitatingly spoken. A member of staff actually escorts you to your room, pointing out features of the hotel and your room. In my case, the young lady in question was an absolute delight, easily imparting professional elegance. The room itself is outstanding, even though I wasn\u2019t lucky enough to get something overlooking Under den Linden or the Brandenberg Gate. It is spacious and well laid out, boasting a separate toilet, separate bath and shower, double basin, copious storage, business areas with desk and 2 chairs, lounge area with 2 chairs and of course, a king size bed. I would only suggest matching ottomans for the loungs chairs (at least one) so that you can put your feet up. The amenities were first class, including gown, slippers etc. The bar area had 4 different types of glasses (beer, whiskey, red wine, white wine), a nice touch. The luxurious furnishings could not be faulted. As with the best of the best, you also have a complimentary overnight shoe shine service. The service was so good that when you visit the spa and come back with wet slippers, the turndown service actually replaces it with new ones. We had a 4 year old with us and he received his own fitted gown and slippers as well as some special bath items. We enjoyed complimentary water, newspaper and internet daily. A hotel like this should never be booked grudgingly, even though it is an expensive choice for most people. \u201cIn for a penny, in for a pound\u201d. You are wasting your time if you do not take advantage of the world class spa facilities, the superb room service menu, afternoon tea in the lobby lounge or dinner at one of the world class restaurants. Service at all times is truly impeccable. My congratulations to the management of this hotel for the way in which their staff deliver service excellence. What is particularly apparent is that it is very different to the aloofness some other pretentious places might deliver. Some very minor issues, which in no way detracted from the quality of my stay but which would prevent this hotel from getting a true 100% include: (a) A large standout stain on the tan bedroom carpet, clearly beyond salvage, which was also clearly old and which I would have expected to have been replaced immediately, (b) the lobby lounge area is a grand space but can be cheapened by day visitors wearing shocking clothing and even daring to drag their backpacks in, all for the cheapest item on the menu. Really, this place is an exquisite experience. Go there prepared to spoil yourself and not complain about the price of things. In fact, this is one of those place where you must splurge - take advantage of the service to the maximum. The staff love to be engaged, if only to show off the ease with which they can pamper you and exceed your expectations.

I check in and am escorted up into my room which was just what I had requested. and this was at about 10 AM. The public area is just beautiful. Unfortunately they do not allow pictures. All of the staff is dressed in uniforms that harken back to a period before the wars. The quality of the service is beyond anything i could have imagined. When you call for a wakeup, they ask you if you would like a complimentary cup of coffee at the time of the call. Then they ask you if you would like a follow up call 10 minutes later in case you want to snooze. When my breakfast was delivered to the room, the woman asked if I wanted her to pour my coffee. The turndown service at night was exceptional. They put your slippers out on this over sized napkin, I guess, so your feet never have to touch the carpet. Very important to travelers like me who cling to old habits, this was the one hotel on my month long trip that cashed travellers checks with no questions asked or a commission. Steps from the front door is the subway entrance, and I do mean steps. I had a view of the Brandenberg Gate from my window that looked out on Unter den Linden. That street is vibrant with activities until about midnight. The windows were very efficient in closing out the sound when I wanted to sleep. The room size was adequate and had the most up to date appurtences, including light switches in the first drawer of the nightstands, ,making it very easy to darken the room while in bed.

Arriving at the Adlon Hotel in Berlin on the afternoon of January 27, I certainly did not expect or need another hassle of body searches to get into the hotel. Nonetheless, that is what happened, and as a result, I will never stay at the Adlon again\u2014although I have enjoyed visits there in the past. When my cab approached the Adlon, we were stopped several blocks away and slowly moved, in snow, to a tent one and a half blocks away from the hotel. I was rudely ordered out of the cab by a guard with a weapon and escorted like a criminal into a tent, where I was ordered about in very rude language. I was then escorted by a guard, carrying my two bags myself for the block and a half into the Adlon lobby,. There, I was told to take off my clothing down to my shirt and trousers, and submitted to a body search. Once through the scanning machine, a very officious woman demanded my passport and drivers license and in very rude language told me to turn one of them in. She sent me to the opposite desk to do this, where I was given a security badge with the order to wear it at all times, in full sight, when in the hotel. I was told that if I needed to leave the hotel, I would need to go through the entire process again. After redressing and finally making it to the reception desk, I presented my American Express card for checkin. In response, the young man behind the counter, a hotel employee, snarled at me \u201cwhat do you want, what are you doing here?\u201d I explained that I was there, of course, to check in. I gave him my name again, and without looking me up in the computer, he snarled, \u201cwe have no record of your reservation.\u201d At this point, fortunately, a women desk person took over and immediately pulled up my reservation and checked me in. Next, two armed guards came up, carrying weapons, and proceeded to escort me to my room, which was located far away on the back side of the hotel, on the ground floor. Not a very desirable room, and not at all comparable to the room I had there last January. When I went out to a meeting the afternoon of Jan. 27, the guard desk was initially unable to locate my drivers license\u2014it had been misfiled, and I had to find it for them. Upon returning two hours later, I was taken to task for not having turned in my security badge when I left the hotel. I explained to the very officious official, who seemed to be a hotel employee, that I had no way of knowing what their procedures were, and it was their responsibility to have taken my badge\u2014and inappropriate for them to be shouting at me for still having the badge in my possession. That evening, when I went down to the Restaurant Quarre for dinner, I asked for a table with a view of the Brandenburg gate. This should not have been a problem, since the hotel and restaurant were very sparsely populated. But the woman at the restaurant reception desk said rudely to me, \u201cit will be impossible to give you a table with such a view.\u201d I pointed out that most tables in the restaurant were empty, and asked why not. Only then was I seated at a table with the requested view. During my entire meal, other tables with gate views remained unfilled. I understand that the reason for the elaborate and intense security was that a foreign chief of state was staying at the Adlon. This does not excuse the fact that guests were not alerted in advance that they would be put through such time-wasting treatment as a result of this official\u2019s presence, so that they would have known to go to another hotel. It was also inexcusable that hotel staff was not present at the security gates to assure that guests were treated respectfully. Most inexcusable was the unprovoked rudeness to paying ordinary guests by staff at the Hotel\u2019s own reception desk. I also wonder if the German prime minister does not have a guest house at which visiting heads of state can be lodged\u2014so that hotel guests are not relegated to nonperson status. As a result of this experience, I will never stay at the Adlon again, and would not recommend it to anyone.

Right from checking in at the hotel you can feel that the service is of a very high standard. Arriving with two small children at a hotel and getting to your room with all your stuff can sometimes be quite troublesome, but here everything went quite smooth with the parking service and staff supporting in carrying luggage to the room. We had booked a Superior Deluxe Room and got an upgrade to a suite which was just outright fantastic with view to the Brandenburg Gate and Untern den Linden. Breakfast was also exquisite with staff able to guess what your desired were even before you yourself had realised this desire. So all was a 5 star experience untill we were about to leave. Since I had booked through Leaders Club we had been promised late check out ( confirmed on two occations from the front desk), but on the final day when we were about to leave the room (coming back from a short final walk in the city) we find that all our belongings had been cleaned away from the room. The hotel did have our luggage in a storage room and we got it all back (apart from some baby food), but we were quite irritated from this behavior. So instead of leaving the hotel with a feeling of having stayed at the most luxurious hotel in Berlin, we just felt that we had been kicked out from a hotel that was more eager to make the next buck than servicing the guests.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSumptuous\u201d", "Author": "kenpoll", "ReviewID": "UR52183327", "Content": "Arrived for a short 3 day city break at 11am and was immediately met with impeccable service right from the kerb (from where you are only 100m from the Brandenburg gate).

I was lucky and I could reserve a special package, including accomodaton, breakfast and other amenities. Also during conversations by e mail, before my arrival, staff seemed very friendly and helping, and so it was also \u2018live\u2019. On my arrival, the front desk employee told me that they had provided me an upgrade for free. They assigned me a deluxe room, with a fantastic view over Brandeburg\u2019s Gate and Unter den Linden boulevard. The room was spacious, elegant, the maximum of luxury, with everything you can imagine: comfortable beds, armchairs, a very big writing desk, a tv set (high definition tv) with dozens of channels, and (I\u2019ve never seen it before in other hotels) an incredibile series of international plugs, to fit every kind of appliance, and a separate locker to charge your notebook or cellphones. Bathroom was astonishing, with separate wc, shower and tub, and every kind of toiletries. The service is excellent: twice a day, housekeeping cleans your room. Opposite my room, was the lift that takes directly to the indoor pool and spa: what a beautiful place, with hot jacuzzi, indoor pool, modern gym, steam bath and sauna. All included in the rate. Customers of the hotels can use (free of charge for 30 minutes every day) the business center facilities to surf the web and check e mails. Breakfast was the symbol of plentyness: you can serve yourself from the buffet or you can ask the waiter everything, with high level service. In the Hotel Adlon\u2019s property there are five restaurant: the front desk gave me a 50 euro voucher to dine in one of the restaurants. I used it at Gabriele\u2019s restaurant, creative italian cuisine (it has been awarded a Michelin star), I was very very satisfied. The biggest surprise was on my birthday: the hotel staff have learned that Sept 24th was my special date, and when I returned in my room, in the late afternoon, I found a birthday cake, especially for me, with chocolates, fruits, and a very warm birthady wish from the hotel. It was really an extraordinary touch. I was really touched by this gift. So, Hotel Adlon is sure one of the finest hotels in Europe, probably in the world. Of course, it\u2019s not a cheap hotel, ma service is really at top. I give you a tip: check the hotel\u2019s website or Kempinski\u2019s website.

Honestly, it was a perfect stay and I would be hard pressed to find any mistakes. You definitely get what you pay for. Even prior to my arrival, the service was top notch. I made several special requests including a non-smoking room, king size bed, room upgrade and early check in. I received an immediate and professional reply which assured me that every effort would be made to ensure my requests. In addition, I contacted the concierge, Chris, to book me a restaurant reservation and to send me the Gold's Gym class schedule. Chris quickly took care of my reservation, contacted Gold's Gym and emailed me their schedule. As my taxi pulled up to the Hotel Adlon, a hotel porter immediately greeted me with a smile and \"hello\", took my bags from the taxi and escorted me quickly to the reception. The reception was warm, cheerful, immediate, very professional and efficient. The receptionist was aware of all my special requests which were met including, to my pleasant surprise, both the room upgrade and the early morning, 9:30 AM check in (I fully expected to have to wait the entire morning in the lobby). After checking me in, which only took a minute, the receptionist brought me up to my room and showed me all the room features. Prior to leaving, she asked if there was anything else that she could do. A question frequently asked by the superb staff. My breakfast was included in the room rate and I enjoyed a delicious breakfast every morning. Coffee and juices were quickly brought to my table and dishes swiftly cleared. There was an impressive buffet selection (breads, cold meats, cereals, yogurts, pasteries) and hot dishes (omelettes, scrambled eggs, oatmeal) were brought to the table upon request. The room was very large and elegant with a wonderful king size bed. I don't like that there were two small comforters rather than one large king size comforter. I often find this in European hotels and it always seems that the two comforters never quite cover me throughout the night. There was a pillow menu with quite a selection which I should have tried! The room was clean and fresh smelling. Three closets allowed for plenty of storage. The bathroom was large with a separate shower and tub and a separate room for the toilet. The first night, I enjoyed a relaxing bath and had a choice of three different bath products (I selected the honey). Great lighted shaving mirror. I also loved the heated tile floor and the bathroom was always toasty and warmer than the rest of the suite. Absolutely no noise at all at any time which was fantastic. I never heard a sound outside of my room! Housekeeping was top notch for both making up my room and turn down service. One morning, I was quite surprised that within the half hour that I'd gone down for breakfast, my room had been made up. Another day, I was in my room working when the maid arrived for the turn down service (which she asked if it was okay). It was like watching a film on fast forward! She was a white tornado - cleaning and replacing towels and turning down the bed! It's rare that I experience that speed of service. Although I didn't have time to use them, there is a very nice pool. The fitness center was pretty typical of most hotels and nothing extraordinary. The lobby is very elegant and I would have liked to have taken photos but there are signs posted prohibiting doing so. The location is central and adjacent to the Brandenburg Gate. Overall, the service was just outstanding. All staff (front desk, doorman, housekeeping, concierge, restaurant, etc.) were friendly, smiling, helpful and made me feel special.

This is a special hotel. Established in 1907, it was severely damaged by bombs in the latter stages of World War II. The Adlon familiy (in concert with Kempinski hotel) re-developed this hotel after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the new Adlon opened for business in 1997. The new hotel takes much of its inspiration from the old hotel, which was steeped in history. The first film contract to involve Marlene Dietrich as an actress was signed in the Adlon. And Bertolt Brecht stayed and worked in some of the surviving rooms of the hotel in the late 1940s. The hotel corridors are unlike any I have ever experienced. The floors are covered in white marble and diamond-style rugs, the walls are also a marbled white. The whole effect is to give an impression of openness and brightness. An intriguing contrast to the more claustraphobic corridors I have encountered elsewhere. Even the elevators have been designed to look exactly as they would have looked back in 1907 (albeit with the benefit of more efficient working technology). The bedrooms are a beguiling mix of new and old. A bedside finger-touch lighting system and up to date hi-fi speakers in the bathroom are coupled with Art Deco style furniture and prints from an earlier era. The bedroom is so intriguingly old world that staying there feels like travelling back in time. The experience of being in historically-styled surroundings was so surreal that there were times when I felt I was in the film version of Agatha Christie's \"At Bertram's Hotel\". The emphasis in the Adlon is on comfort and the beds have a wraparound quality to them which encourages night-time hibernation (especially in sub-zero climes). The lobby of the hotel is truly a jewel. It serves a mouth-watering afternoon tea. But, in addition to this, a tasty supply of meals and snacks is available until late in the evening. I had the wiener schnitzel, pommes frites and cucumber salad, washed down with a couple of Jupiter pilseners. A simple repast. But everything in the hotel is cooked to perfection and arrives soon after you have ordered it. And the service is out of this world. If you stay here, check out the ground floor restaurant. If you're lucky (like I was), they'll give you a table overlooking the Brandenburg Gate.

We had travelled from Copenhagen and were a bit tired - and this gorgeous 5 star hotel within spitting distance of the Brandenburg gate could not have been a better choice. My husband and I travel a lot for business as well as pleasure - but this was the first time we have been travelling - all the way from Australia - with a one year old. And the Adlon has made our stay in Berlin one of the most happy trips we have experienced. Our room was outstanding, the bathroom was to die for. And I am a tall woman and was able to recline in the full length bath - with complimentary glass cofrets of different bath salts and bubble baths at my fingertips. The concierge arranged babysitting at 17 Euros an hour (cheaper than an agency that I had independantly contacted in advance who wanted 20 Euro per hour)...and also arranged sight seeing tours, and restaurant and club reservations. We had previously used Lonely Planet to find shopping receommendations - but found this not to our taste - and yet concierge was able to direct us to where we wanted to go. They arranged a cot and bed linen for our baby - and serviced the rooms twice a day. All the major sights are within walking distance from the Reichstag, Jewish museum, Potsdamer Platz and the Unter Den Linden. It is about 20 Euros via taxi from the Tegel Airport and I cannot recommend this Hotel more highly. It was the one that Michael Jackson hung his baby out of - remember? And last night while we were here the Chancellor was here too. Its a bit lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and if you can cop the 35 Euro a glass for a glass of Dom Perignon n the lobby bar - and the average price of main courses in the ground floor restaurant are around 35 euro a main course too - you don't mind because well...it is the best hotel in Berlin. Fortunately Expedia was able to secure us a room rate of AUD $468 per night which was phenonenal - but you know what? We would have paid more if we had to because it is such an excellent Hotel. Well done Hotel Adlon Kempinski. If this is a taste of the Kempinski chain we will definitely stay here again in your other hotels in Europe.

Firstly the location is fantastic, right next door to the Brandenburg Gate. As soon as your taxi pulls up at the hotel you know you're getting service and that nothing is too much trouble. The hotel lobby is exquisite with a big water feature consisting of a tower of black elephants which survived the hotel when it was badly bombed during the war. The lobby area is also utilised as a posh tearoom with a fantastic array of fancy cakes on display and the bar area. To add to the ambiance there is a constant stream of men playing a grand piano in the balcony area. Refreshments are not cheap but well worth it just to soak up the atmosphere and they do give you plenty of nibbles as well. Once checked in, the girl behind reception actually showed us to our room. Unfortunately, despite asking for a non-smoking room we were taken to one which was obviously not. We were then shown another room which was ok. The rooms were also very opulent, (which doesn't always follow in hotels) with huge comfortable beds and a fantastic bathroom. No mod cons spared. Separate shower, bath, two sinks, dressing table. Getting ready to go out was a joy. The hotel features a couple of restaurants, one being a michelin star eatery. We decided to give this a whirl and the food was certainly different - canapes of fox!! Again the ambiance of the restaurant which was no more than a small circular room with a huge fire and spectacular views of the gate outside lit up was amazing. The food was delicious and it was obvious that both the chef and the sommelier were experts in their trade. As with everything at this hotel the cost of the meal was not for the faint hearted and todate it is probably one of the most expensive meals we have had but the memories will stay with me for ever. Breakfasts were also sumptious and no complaints there. The hotel also features a health spa which isn't really my thing but it is supposed to one of the best.

Definitely a five star hotel for European standards. Room was nice although again the typical European queen bed means two twins pushed together. The actual size of the room was much larger than other European hotels I have stayed in. Bathroom was interesting because the actual toilet had two doors leading to it in a small room with a mirror facing you if you sit on the toilet. Rest of bathroom (shower, bath and 2 sinks) was connected to one door and was large. Had three English speaking channels (CNN, BBC and CNBC Europe) although did not spend much time in room. The hotel is in a great location if you plan on exploring the city. Unter den Linden S-Bahn stop and the Brandenburg Gate are literally right in front of hotel. If you get a room on the Northwest corner of the hotel you may actually get an amazing view of the Brandenburg Gate from your hotel room. The Jewish holocaust memorial is right outside the rear of the hotel. Also, the Reichstag, parts of the wall, Checkpoint Charlie and the Potsdamer Platz area are all within 10-15 minute walk of hotel. Didn\u2019t eat in the hotel, I think breakfast was $36 euros. There is a Starbucks and Hagen Daz right across the street from the front of the hotel and a Dunkin Donuts right outside the rear of the hotel. There are also several restaurants within a 10 minute walk from the rear of the whole to the Potsdamer Platz area. Nice pool and spa facilities however I found the gym to be lacking for a five star hotel. The gym was tiny with 2 treadmills, a bike, elliptical, rowing machine and a few free weight dumbbells. However, if the weather is nice you can make an easy run through Tiegarten Park which is right next door to the hotel.

On arrival, the bellhop was quick to approach the taxi and handle the luggage. Check-in was fast and I was personally escorted to the room. My husband, who arrived separately late that evening, was also smoothly escorted to the room without any hassle. We reserved a superior deluxe room with a view to the Boulevard \u2018Unter den Linden\u2019 or to the Academy of Arts, and would encourage guests to select this room category. The view of the Brandenburger Tor, both day and night, is simply amazing from the room. There was unfortunately some construction work at the Underground just opposite the hotel, but the windows are sound-proofed and it is quiet at nights and on weekends. The room is tastefully designed, clean and very comfortable. The internet connections and power outlets are tidely integrated in a cupboard. Would sugggest that the hotel change to flat screen TVs. The mini-bar offers in addition to the standard items some Adlon cookies and chocolates. There is also complimentary mineral water and fruits supplied daily in the room. We did not have breakfast at the hotel. There is a Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and a sandwich shop just opposite the hotel. For those who want a special ambience, the Cafe Einstein, a famous German Cafe, is approximately 100m from the hotel (along Unten den Linden, on the opposite side of Adlon). This cafe is visited by German TV moderators, journalists and politicians. The food is good and the design is stylish, giving the cafe a special atmosphere. We dined one night at the Lorenz Adlon. The restaurant used to be a reading room and the hotel has beautifully converted it into a restaurant, retaining the library. From the restaurant, there is a wonderful view of the Brandenburger Tor, especially from the window seats. If you do not have a room with a view of the Brandenburger Tor, dining in this restaurant is a good alternative. If you want to eat out, there are lots of restaurants just behind the Adlon. We tried a steak house, Block House, and had great beef steaks, baked potatos and salads. We decided to eat Chinese one night, and had an excellent authentic Chinese meal at the Ming\u00b4s Garden China restaurant on Tauentzienstrasse 16 (near the KaDeWe shopping centre). At the Adlon spa, there is a pool, a whirlpool, and separate sauna areas for men and women. The spa offers a range of cometics, massages and wellness packages.

The hotel is within walking distance of many tourist sites including the Gate, the Holocaust Memorial, the beautiful and fascinating Mitte district and its many Cold War and WWII sites, Potsdammer Platz, and even Museum Island if you're an ambitious walker. If not, the S-Bahn is down the block. It's central location, however, means that you'll be surrounded by tourists looking for the perfect photo of the Gate, or the infamous Michael Jackson balcony at the hotel. There is construction outside the hotel, with a new S-bahn entrance being built, but you won't notice it at all from inside the building. I stayed in a Deluxe room overlooking the architecturally transparent Arts Academy, so it's not necessary to book a room overlooking Brandenburg Gate in order to get an interesting view. The windows open so I could easily also see the Reichstag and other buildings. The service is excellent, what you'd expect at a 5 star hotel. The food is also first rate, though expensive, so you might just pop over to the Starbucks across the street for breakfast. The lobby of the hotel was reminiscent of a more formal Peabody Hotel (Memphis) or an old-school hotel whose lobby is a gathering place for locals. The business center was always accessible, with 3 computers available for internet use. The staff was attentive and friendly, though formal. In fact if I have a complaint about this hotel, it would be its formality. I never felt quite as comfortable as I did at, say, the Halekulani or the Peabody. Overall, if I were to return to Berlin I might try a hotel more in the center of Mitte with a little less formality, but if you don't mind the stiffness, I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cA Berlin institution restored\u201d", "Author": "dfwmw", "ReviewID": "UR8244872", "Content": "A wonderful hotel right in the heart of Berlin.

The building is magnificent, just next to the Brandenburg gate, walking distance to Friedrichstrasse shopping (Quartier 206 mall). The interiors are very luxurious and grand and so are the rooms.

The public areas are very grand too, and the spa is beautiful as well, with quite large pool, whirlpool, gym, solariums, Guerlain treatments. The downstairs restaurant Quarre is a large and crowded place serving quality dishes (had lunches there) while the restaurant Lorenz Adlon upstairs is an unique fine dining experience with old-world flawless service and premium haute cuisine. There are only very few tables in this restaurant and some have a direct view of the Brandenburg Gate which makes the whole dining experience even more enjoyable as do the sumptuous floral arrangements around. The Lobby is ideal setting for a cofee or a small daytime snack. There is also an upscale dance/nightclub just next to the hotel (Club Felix), you have to use the hotel's back exit and it's just steps away, there were large crowds waiting to get in and if you stay in the Adlon you have privileged access there.

In the Adlon, of course, everything is perfect: rooms, pool, public areas etc. We stayed in a junior suite for two nights. The suite was spacious, with a well-equipped pantry, high-tech audio-system, wooden floor, large three-colored-marble bathroom, separate toilet etc. However, you must prefer a somewhat plushy style to enjoy the ambiance. This is also true for the service. Service is attentive, of course. If you sit in any public area, within 30 seconds you will be approached by a waiter or waitress. This can be bothering.
