Excellent service and good food. The ambiance is amazing. Just across from the important museums in Amsterdam and with the Amsterdam equivalent of Rodeo Drive around the corner. The Vondelpark is there for watching people and some jogging. Walk past the Rijksmuseum and you are in the canal district. What else could you want! The design of the lobby is stylish and excellent for lounging.

Booked a table for 8 of us in The Brasserie. Staff acknowledged our booking and advised us that some of the group had arrived and were in the bar upstairs. Ours coats were promptly taken and we were served in the bar quickly. The interior of this building is fantastic with great attention to detail. Our table was ready on time and we were advised on the specials of the day. The restaurant certainly wasn't intimate due to its size and scale but the lighting and decor made it feel comfortable.

We did not notice any construction noise or other inconveniences. The entrance of the hotel has a great ambiance. The personnel outside (valet parking) and at the front desk were very friendly and service oriented. We had to wait quite some time before we could get the key, but that was probably because we arrived at 3 in stead of 5 as originally planned. We were offered a complimentary drink fro the brasserie whilst waiting though. The room we booked ( standard double) was clean, comfortable, luxerous but smallish. Good matrass. The spa looks great, but is aso still in its completion stage ( no inconvenience though). Breakfast ok, although having to pay additional for fried eggs etc (eventhough breakfast was included in room price) was a bit surprising (especially considering that the hotel rates are quite high)", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ronpel", "Title": "\u201cVery high class-best in Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "ronpel", "ReviewID": "UR124108336", "Content": "We took advantage of the current special rates as most hotel rooms are still at work.

Just a small amount of rooms is in use right now. The former conservatory is beautifully constructed and maintaned all its floors, walls ceilings very well. It is actually a very cosmopolitan hotel. Like you will find in New York, London, Copenhagen etc. It is difficult to give the right opinion yet. I had read reviews about lousy service and arrogant attitude, but that was not our opinion today at the Brasserie. Very friendly and service minded people, great atmosphere and a likable crowd. We bumped into many friends(all from Amsterdam). A good place to take your foreign business partners to. Looking forward to try the restaurant \" Tunes\" , with it's chef from the former Blakes and the College Hotel. Quite pricy though and not to flexible on the fixed courses, i have heard, but better find out myself. I did not dare to give it 5 stars yet, because we have to see how they are doing a little later on this year. But in the mean time i am a fan and going to try out the High Tea at the Brasserie soon and definitely will be back for breakfast and brunch!. Love their menu anyhow. Along the corridor on the main entrance level(with is not open yet), you will find a beautiful cigar shop and the well known beautiful decorated jewelry shop \"Bonebakker\" . Rooms not yet finished yet and what i found is that you are not able to open the windows of the rooms. I would not like that! I hate to smell the former visitors in a room.

Not just the building itself, which is magnificent, but also the efficient looking clad-in-black personnel. We thus had high hopes for lunch at the lovely light brasserie. Unfortunately, we were underwhelmed by both the food and the service. My overpriced goat cheese salad was spare, consisting of a bit of crumbled cheese, discolored beets, store-bought croutons and strips of bacon covered in coagulated grease. Club sandwich mediocre. Wine by the glass fine. Coffee okay. After finally catching a waiter's eye to ask for the bill, we subsequently had a long wait. So we resorted to asking someone else.
