I was going to choose it again and again as I visit Barcelona often. BUT! When I was back in my country already (!!!), I'd got the following email: This afternoon we have charged 89,00 \u20ac in your credit card, because the night of 1st February was not included in the last Invoice you have paid on the 31st January., so 89,00 \u20ac was the remaining amount to be charged. If you need we send the invoice by e-mail you can just answer this e-mail, please. Would anybody want an invoice being in this situation? I was ready to pay for any nights not included in my invoice even if it was a STAFF's MISTAKE... And I was sooo surprised to be confronted with a fait accompli; and not to be advised before my credit card had been charged... There was one more email from the hotel, the one with a piece of precious advice \"to check carefully if all my bills had been fully paid before leaving the hotel\"... My invoice was fully paid, btw... Or maybe it was of my responsibility to check if there were no miscalculations... Thank you, guys. I was really impressed. I travelled a lot but never experienced anything like that.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Trondheim, Norway", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel away from the busy center\u201d", "Author": "nordboer2010", "ReviewID": "UR120212370", "Content": "A nice hotel with polite and very helpful and service minded staff. We were lucky and got a big terrace. with table, chairs and a sunbed. That came in good use, because there was no dining table in the apartment.

A good bed and a lot of storing space in cupboards and drawers.Very simple kitchen facilities, but clean and sufficient for making small meals.Five minutes to metro and bus.

Very clean rooms and professional, courteous staff. The location was a safe, upscale neighborhood with groceries stores, restaurants, a church and banks all within a few minutes walking distance. The metro station (El Putxet) was a few blocks away and it took you downtown in about 15-20 minutes. The only cons were that my room faced the street and was a little noisy due to traffic. The air-conditioning did not work a couple of nights, but I was given a fan and it wasn't hot at that time of year, and also got a 5% discount on my stay.

It is a small aparthotel. Rooms have what you would need for a short stay in Barcelona. The place is well kept. The reception is 24 hours, important if you need to arrive at erratic hours. The rooms are cleaned daily including the small kitchen. The WiiFi works. There are Spanish newspapers, and now a small breakfast room which will do in an emergency or when you do not feel like preparing one. The advantage of the place is that it is located in a good residential area. Maybe a bit out of the touristic action, but it is well communicated by the metro and bus just a short walk. There are shops, banks, bakeries, delicatessen, supermarkets, restaurants and even a covered market where real residents not tourists are buying so you have a more real experience of the city. A pity they do not have self laundry, but there is a wash n dry nearby to cover that need too. I would recommend it for those who want to experience the life of Barcelona not as a mere tourist.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucharest", "Title": "\u201cexcellent!\u201d", "Author": "bolitaBucharest", "ReviewID": "UR50119107", "Content": "reception desk very polite and helpful,good english,rooms very big and spotless,close to metro station.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bradford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood value, very clean, 95 euros a night for room for 4!\u201d", "Author": "huntergraym", "ReviewID": "UR3915421", "Content": "Stayed for 3 nights in room for 4 - had twin beds and made up double bed settee.

(Pity we dont read Spanish!) Nearest underground (metro) station is El Puxtet on L7 which runs til 11pm most nights, v cheap ticket for 10 metro trips called a T10 for just over 6 euros. Even staff at most stations to help tourists get their tickets. when changing lines be prepared for a bit of a hike in some cases, platforms not always very close. Cost one way with about 4 suitcases to airport about 25 to 30 euros. Apparently easily and much cheaper done by rail links that DONT run 24 hrs.

We were not disappointed by the low-moderately priced Bonavena Aparthotel. The room was spacious, divided in two parts by a closet unit, and clean. It had a really nice view of a private garden across the street. It was close to public transportation (the subway stop 3 blocks and a bus route half a block away). The subway is about 4 stops from the Ramblas, and runs frequently, and is safe. The neighborhood was very quiet, and adorned with Michelin recommended restaurants, of which we ate in several. The staff was helpful. One caveat: the parking lot is underground and very difficult to get in and out of. I wouldn't recommend using it other than to park your car when you arrive and drive off when you leave.
