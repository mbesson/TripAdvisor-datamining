We arrived and got a taxi to Hotel Tamara which cost 12 euro this was the first rip-off - it was about a 2 minute drive. The outside of the hotel was grubby and dirty we rang the bell and went up to reception which was absolutely filthy although the Aussie guy was friendly and recommended we stay at another of their properties called the Blarney Stone - he made a call and someone came to pick us up - we had to walk back to more or less where we had arrived opposite the Central station!! The first room they showed us was on the second floor up very steep rickety stairs and was disgusting the blankets were dirty and covered in burns, we were looking unto a wall about 2 ft. away from our window. We were shocked, we weren't expecting the Ritz but for the money approximately 31 euro each we did expect CLEAN. I have travelled extensively and have stayed in basic budget rooms but this place is gross. We refused the room and were shown one next door, the sheets were clean and one bed had a duvet cover, but the blankets needed a good wash. The windows did not close and were tied up with old shoe laces and tights, the walls were painted 4 different shades of green and one wall not even finished. When we were there heat was unbearable as there were air-con at the bottom of the gap between the two buildings and the heat from them meant we were getting warm air through the window. I read reviews before booking this hotel and some were quite good describing it as \"cozy\" - where do these people live!! If you want a clean basic room at a reasonable price do NOT stay at either of these venues - the only thing they have going is the location and the bar staff at the Blarney Stone and locals were friendly, but hey there are hundred of hotels and hostels in this area and I'm sure any of them would be better than this. Just don't book it it really is disgusting!!!!!", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNEVER STAY HERE....AVOID AVOID AVOID\u201d", "Author": "girlonly", "ReviewID": "UR110696874", "Content": "I am all for budget hostels and sparse rooms, but this was DISGUSTING! horrible shared bathroom, noisy, smelly stuffy room with NO WINDOW! and 100% heard mice scratching around our room during the night! horrifically overpriced for what you actually get...should be a lot cheaper... like about \u00c2\u00a35 a night! I am really not fussy and have stayed in lovely plain hostels in paris, barcelona, that were cheap, clean and simple, but this was horrible....also the fact that the walls of the bedroom were covered in ripped out pages of fashion magazines was a bit wierd..

Dark stairwell, everything extremely old, beds and bedding looked older than my grandma. We decided to stay a night and see what happened. Checked the beds, no bed bugs but decided to sleep in our sleep sacks to be cautious. In the end, although it wasn#t the newest place, it was good enough to sleep the night in. You get clean towels and sheets whenever you want for free, as well as free internet and coffee/tea. The owner does harp on a lot, but he is harmless. Although I hate cats and was not impressed about the cat hanging around, it was no problems. The owner had good advice on things to do and places to eat: All in all it was cheap and good enough to rest your head. I found that the toilets and showers were always clean. So you get what you pay for, and its good enough, especially as it is so central to bars, shops and the central station. We stayed for 5 nights in the end and grew to somehow love hotel tamara", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cCozy oldfashion safe Hotel\u201d", "Author": "juble3", "ReviewID": "UR94683266", "Content": "We had a great time in Amsterdam and really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Tamara.

We were told at reception that there were 3 shared toilets in the building, but only 1 of them was working. Yes you heard right, one toilet for the whole hotel (say 30 ppl?). The toilet that did work was tiny and utterly disgusting. When we walked into the triple room that we had booked, we found water leaking from the ceiling. We were changed to a quad, in which the heating wasn't working. The towels we were given were all filthy. Unrelated, I saw bottle filled with urine outside one of the rooms (as a result of 2 of the 3 toilets out of order). After just 2 hours of this hell, our group left and checked into a 3* hotel down the street. All I can say is this place is just not worth the cost saving. The place is a complete nightmare.
