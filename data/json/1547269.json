Room: I love the design and furnishing, which is somewhat like a boutique hotel but the rooms are small. Everything in the room was working so no complaints on this. Breakfast: Limited choices available and the food quality was acceptable by my standard. The restaurant was quite small too but nicely decorated.

Probably, but not with my young children. Would I come again to Istanbul?

I read the reviews and saw the pics posted here and therefor decided to go for it,but the truth is that this hotel is nothing as the reviews posted here. I frankly dont advice anyone to stay here except if you're on a very tight budget,although this hotel is way overpriced according to its location and standard. This hotel is located at Laleli,Istanbul,not a good place to stay at,i would recommend places like Sultan Ahmed or Taqsim. The room i stayed at had a borken AC which was leaking day and night,causing the carpets to be soaked with water causing a terrible smell ! In addition had a terrible noise,we reported this to the receptionist but nothing was done,only one man came and laid towels underneath it !! The bathroom is terrible,very small,broken handles,broken shower,water is not clean. Electricity broke two times in 4 days which came as a surpise to me,they dont have backup generators for the AC or anything,only the lights. The only good thing about this hotel is the receptionist we met on our 2nd and 3rd day,Zuhal and Murad,were helpful when we asked them for anything and always provided us with updates. So to sum up,you will not be happy with your stay at this hotel,the only case i would recommend this if you're on a very tight budget,otherwise try to avoid this hotel and all the hotels at Laleli for that matter,i scanned the area and all the hotels at Laleli are of the same standard. Apart from this,Istanbul and Turkey is a great place and i would definately come back again soon.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cAwesome and comfortable stay.\u201d", "Author": "Reham1913", "ReviewID": "UR115428819", "Content": "The hotel was cozy and close to everything.

Staff were very helpful at sorting us out a nice (tho' not cheap) place to eat on the first evening. Comfortable triple room. Reasonable size for this part of the city and very clean. The shower (once they remembered to turn the hot water on!) was excellent. Not very wheelchair/pushchair/heavy suitcase friendly as there are some quite steep steps to get to the door before you reach the hotel lifts, although the staff did dash down to give us a hand with our cases. Decent breakfast with plenty of choice in the top floor restaurant. Fairly scruffy location (though safe and quiet ; apart from the guy with the 03.15 Ramazan drum, but well placed for walking to the main sights such as Aya sofia and the Blue Mosque. If you want good shops you are better off going over to the more modern part of Istanbul. Air conditioning a must for Istanbul in August. Easy access to the tram also. special thanks to Erdem who made sure that we caught the right ferry to The Princes' Islands.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abuja, Nigeria", "Title": "\u201cClean, pragmatic, superb service and prime location\u201d", "Author": "hajjagana", "ReviewID": "UR69209433", "Content": "Introduced by a colleague to stayed with me at the hotel.

Breakfast was a great start - expansive view, peaceful, good spread, attentive service.
