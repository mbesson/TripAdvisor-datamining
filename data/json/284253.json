Firstly, service was not as good. When we arrived, the receptionist was rather curt, and when we asked politely if he could make a reservation at a particular restaurant for us that evening, and he took down our details. When we arrived at the restaurant, there wasn't any reservation made in our name, and fortunately there were 2 last seats not reserved, so we took it immediately. If we were a tad later, we might just have lost the opportunity to eat at that particular restaurant since it was our last night in Venice. We also had to pay quite a bit for internet access (20 euros for 2 days - I had free internet access at similar hotel prices in other cities). For the rooms, simple amenities were given (soap shampoo showercap), but no bathroom slippers. It can get a little cold so if you're bothered, do bring your own. the bathroom is not very well insulated so it was VERY cold after my showers. Quite a torture turning off the shower and grabbing my towel even. It's a shame that such a beautiful hotel is marred by the above.

But don't let that put you off. Walking 70 metres to have your breakfast on the balcony beside the Grand Canal watching the world go by in the sunshine is no hardship at all. The staff we great and all spoke perfect English and couldn't do enough. I had read some bad reviews about the buffet breakfast, but we thought it was great. Choice of cereals, yoghurt, the usual continental cold meats and cheese, plus cooked eggs, bacon etc. Plenty of juice, fresh fruit and big choice of breads and pastries. Plus all the coffee/tea you could drink brought to your table. You could go a la carte breakfast and pay, but it would be pricey. So overall no complaints, would go back tomorrow.

During our last visit to Venice, we had stayed at it's sister hotel and knew that this property was located in a separate albeit adjacent building. Since the sister hotel - Monaco & Grand Canal was completely booked (they did offer us ONE room at > \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 300.00 per night but we were in need of two) we settled for this property and kept our fingers crossed. However, all our fears were laid to rest when we checked into our rooms at the Palazzo Selvadego (608 & 609) Even though the hotel itself is located about a 100m away from the sister property in a rather plain-looking building, both our rooms were quite spacious and 609 took the cake!! It was a duplex with wooden beamed ceiling and had separate areas for the Master bedroom, change room with lots of clothes hangers, a large toilet & separate shower area and an additional study room above, which was connected vide a flight of wooden steps and also contained a single bed. Our check-in was handled smoothly at the tiny lobby (the main lobby is at the Hotel Monaco & Grand Canal) and we were informed that breakfast would be served on the main hotel's terrace (between 8 AM and 10:30 AM) which is an overhang on the Grand Canal with lovely views. The hotel is located just behind the St. Mark's Square but not on the Grand Canal - so great location but no views. As has been pointed out in certain earlier reviews, the check-out is a bit of a hassle as one needs to lug heavy luggage down to the other hotel's lobby (about 100 m) Having said that, our check-out was handled quite efficiently and though it required a number of sheets to be printed (for which the front desk was apologetic), it didn't require more than FIVE minutes in total. As it is, if one intends to catch a vaporetto to Santa Lucia / Alilguna to the Airport, one would need to cross the Monaco & Grand Canal to reach the Valaresso / S. Zaccaria stop. I would recommend this hotel for it's location and nicely appointed rooms (with a caveat - the rooms are NOT the usual high ceilinged, headboard painted, Silk-Jacquard curtained, over-the-top furnished, Venetian ones - for that the Monaco is better !!)", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cDecent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "viola v", "ReviewID": "UR119180891", "Content": "My friend and my spend a week in June 2010 in this hotel. As many other reviewers have already mentioned the location of the hotel is simply unbeatable. Walk under the arches of the Napoleonic Wing where Correr Museum is located and turn to the right. Here you are! Most rooms have no view which is typical for Venetian houses since they face narrow medieval streets. My friend's room had a view at the roofs, my corner room had two windows overlooking the Hard Roch cafe and gondola parking in front of Hotel Cavaletto. There were absolutely no noise from Hard Rock cafe except usual noises from walking tourists. And tourists walk around the city till 2am. I slept with windows open since I don't like airconditioning, though I used it at day time and it worked fine. The room was not that big but I had a double room for single use so it was OK. The bathroom had no bath but only a shower and was big and well equiped. My friend's room was a little bit bigger but not significantly. The hotel is very clean and very quiet. We never heard or met other guests, only occasionally some chamber-maids. Though hotel has a nice transparent glass elevator (one can see old original brick walls of the building while using it), the building has rather peculiar floor plan so be prepared to walk few steps up or down when you arrive at your floor. My friend had a foot injury before our vacation and this few steps were a problem for him. Check-in is in the sister hotel Monaco and then the porter carried our luggage to Selvadego. On the departure day the luggage was carried by the porter to the main hotel as well. Breakfast was also at the Monaco terrace with breathtaking view. We spent hours at that terrace during breakfast, refreshing at the daytime and having dinner. The restaurant is very good but it is better to make reservation. But even when we didn't book in advance we got a table as hotel guests (though it happened only once, then we tried to make reservation in the morning). The restaurant is very popular, there are guests coming from other hotels and Italians having family dinners and small parties there. The waiters are super nice and friendly. Cocktail Bellini in the bar is much much better than in Harry's Bar which is a one step from the terrace.

You check in and check out at the Monaco. When you check in you will be escorted with your luggage to the Palazzo which is about a 5 min walk away. We were given room 620 which also included a seperate sitting room with another TV, cooker, sink, double bathroom, wardrobes etc which was brilliant. If I had to be picky then the bed wasn't particularly comfy and there was only one pillow each. The rooms were also very dark. There was no view we only looked out onto another building. But you will find that you will have so much to do this shouldn't be a problem. It doesn't reallly feel like you are staying in a hotel though, more like a self contained apartment as there is no bar or anything and we saw no other guests at all. On staying here you have the best of both worlds as breakfast is served in the Monaco and you are seated outside overlooking the Grand Canal which is amazing we could have sat here all day. Breakfast is basic a few rolls with jam, tea or coffee. You can pay for extras but they are quite expensive 4 Euros for a bowl of cereal. The waiters are polite but not particularly friendly. The Palazzo Selvadego is literally a 10 second walk from St Marks Square which is really convenient. For the price you pay to stay here compared to the Monaco I would definately recommend this hotel, if you're looking for a bit of luxury then stay at the Monaco but if you are on a tighter budget then this is really good value for money. The water bus from the airport cost 15 Euro's each way and stops outside the Monaco which again is really convenient as it can be difficult wandering round the little streets trying to find your hotel with your suitcases etc as we saw many people doing. If you decide to go on a Gondola then get on outside the Monaco as it cost 80 Euros (per trip not per person) if you get on round the corner at Marks Square it will cost you 150 Euros and at the Rialta Bridge it is 120 Euros all for the same duration of 40 Mins.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing end to an otherwise excellent break\u201d", "Author": "Gillian S", "ReviewID": "UR116519770", "Content": "My husband and I were staying at this hotel for a few days having just completed a cruise to Croatia. The Palazzo del Selvadego is the annexe of the Hotel Monaco and both hotels are in fantastic positions in Venice. The Palazzo is literally steps away from St Marks Square and the Hotel Monaco sits alongside the Grand Canal. The reception on our arrival at the Monaco was superb even though we arrived early in the morning. Our luggage was stored until the room was ready and then taken over to the annexe for us. We were shown to our room soon after lunch (having spent the morning exploring). Our room was nicely furnished and unbelievably large - we had a 6ft bed and a seating area as well as a large shower room. From the moment we arrived we were treated as well as the guests at the main hotel and the service was excellent. When I broke a glass in the bedroom it was immediately dealt with and slippers provided so that there was no chance of either of us getting glass in our feet. Breakfast was taken at the Hotel Monaco, on the terrace - a very basic continental breakfast was included but the views made up for the lack of choice. How disappointing it was then that when I went to settle our bill on the evening before our departure they refused to allow me to do this and insisted that I return in the morning (even though this would mean an extra detour from the annexe with our suitcases). The reception staff were curt to the point of rudeness. They seemed to be worried that we would eat in the restaurant that evening without paying and then empty the room bar. When my husband returned to reception and insisted on settling the account later that night they refused to believe that he had not made the phone call that had been charged to our account. Both episodes left us feeling like second class citizens and we were not sure if this was because we were staying in the annexe or because we had paid for the hotel using airmiles.

A bedroom + a bathroom divided into 2 - 1 room with 2 sinks and teh other the restroom + shower. Everything was marble and very esthetic. There are no \"view\" rooms in this hotel - our room was above a tiny street below and relatively quiet. There is no lobby to this hotel - just an a narrow entrance, very nice transparent elevator.

This hotel is the baby brother of Hotel Monaco, one of the most luxurious hotels in Venice and breakfast is served there on the terrace. Trust me - it's a good deal :-) a FABULOUS view of the canal, the gondolas and the islands ahead. Add the red geranium and you have a very romantic breakfast for two. Continental breakfast is included. We added 2 things - a plate of cheese (3 pieces of cheese 9 euros!!) and an omlettee which took forever to make...(6.5 euros) - but all in all it was fine - what counts is the amazing view! The hotel is right behind St. Mark's - so the location is the BEST. We came to see the art Biennalle (GREAT) and it's a 15 min walk from there. Someone here wrote about being escorted to the Monaco hotel for check out. No such thing. Actually the receptionist got really pissed off when I asked her about that. To reach the hotel - when you land in venice airport (marco polo) you can take a bus (no 5) to the island to Piazza Roma. We WALKED to the hotel at 22:00 pm - weather was amazing,, suitcase not too heavy - it was great to do the walk. Very easy to get lost...but you'll get there...it's about 30-40 minutes and meanwhile you get to know some of the romantic little spots in Venice...You can take a Vaporretto - bus boat directly from the airport to San Marco - that's about a hour or you can take a taxi boat - that would be much more expensive. a taxi boat from mid Venice to San Marco is ~60 euros...but worth it if you ask me.

For the most part this hotel was wonderful. The location can't be beat! The hotel was right next to St. Marks square and nearby shopping.

I stayed in room 702 which had an entry/dressing area, a sleeping chamber, and a bathroom to die for! I really enjoyed the room. The view left something to be desired but really who goes to Venice to stay in their room and look out the window? I wasn't too impressed with breakfast. It was just rolls, coffee, and some very nasty powdered juice that I was told was orange juice. Sitting outside on the deck for breakfast at the opening to the Grand Canal was a great way to start the day. Watching the gondoliers ready their gondolas for the was an added bonus! There were two negatives for me about the hotel. First, the walls were paper thin! I could hear the couple in the next room cough and sneeze as if they were in the same room. While I do enjoy hearing Italians arguing passionately; in the middle of the night, not so much. Luckily it didn't last long. The other thing I didn't like about the hotel is with it being an annex of the Hotel Monaco and Grand Canal, guests aren't treated as well as you would expect from a four star hotel. On the day I was checking out, I was leaving the building and the man at the desk told me to give him my key. He then told me he had to escort me to the Hotel Monaco so I don't skip out on my bill! I was pretty miffed! I explained that they had my credit card number and there was no chance of that happening. He told me I didn't have a choice. Of course I walked with him following me at a distance to the other hotel. I'm sure he was a little wary due to the steam coming out of my ears. LOL! I told the woman at the front desk that I found this rude and disrespectful but she just smirked and said people skip out on their bills all the time. It wasn't a good way to end the trip, but it was a nice stay nonetheless. One last thing, if you book your stay on the hotel's website and pick a package. I suggest skipping the one where you can upgrade your room if there is one available. I chose that one and didn't get upgraded even though there was room.

TV is small but we didn't care. Wifi is not free, even at the main lobby internet access is pricey. Breakfast is served at the Monaco, overlooking the Canal, with a great view of the water traffic and the islands in the south. We had an amazing time in Venice. Make sure you also explore the areas away from San Marco. The strip between Rialto and San Marco is touristy and can get very busy especially in the weekend. Don't be discouraged by some comments about mediocre food. Yes, Venice is not cheap, but there are great choices for food and wine, including some at very reasonable prices. Great seafood tapas and italian-style sashimi, good wine from the surrounding areas (we loved the whites). Check the hotel website for offers. We got one at 390 euros for 3 nights, including basic (continental) breakfast, vaporetto passes for the duration of our stay, and free entry at the casino (didn't go but seriously reconsidered after dropping by nearby B-Bar for a regrettable nightcap).", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zante, Greece", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "NikiZante", "ReviewID": "UR98887575", "Content": "Easy to find, as mentioned by other reviewers - just get off the vaporetto at San Marco and the sister hotel, the Monaco and Grand Canal is right there and they will direct you.

Breakfast at the Monaco, overlooking the Gondolas on the Grand Canal, was lovely despite the breakfast being basic. Never mind, we used the leftover bread to feed the birds in San Marco! English speaking TV channels were limited (yes I know you shouldnt want to watch TV on holiday, but just now and then you need to rest your weary legs after getting lost in the narrow streets)! If you get the free water taxi from the Monaco to Murano, beware...you feel very pressurised to buy when there. Importantly, the Aliliguna boat tickets (ie 2 or 3 day) are valid on the ACTV water taxis - we didnt find this out until later. The Trip Advisor number 1 rated restaurant, the Al Beneficio (if Ive got that right) was very nice, if a tad pricey. Just follow signs for Al Academia.

We asked if this what the hotel and he said \"what hotel, what's your name\" right at the door, blocking the entrance so we could not get in. \"Do you have a booking?\" We answered yes. He walked to his desk and we followed him and he asked us for our names again. We thought he knew everyone that was checking in that day by heart!

I think this property is a good balance. We parked at Tronchetto (cheaper than Piazza Roma) and took the Valperetto to Piazza San Marco. It was quite a walk, particularly if you have luggages with you. If you happen to park at Piazza Roma, then the Valparetto will take you directly in front of the Hotel Monaco (sister property) where you can check in and a porter will transport your suitcases for you to the Palazzo, which is just around the corner. From a location standpoint, it is just adjacent to Piazza San Marco, with high end shopping at your door step, but because it is not located on the main thoroughway into Piazza San Marco, you miss the crowds. Behind the hotel are the maze of streets with local eateries and shops. The Palazzo doesn't have a restaurant, but we ate breakfast at their sister property Hotel Monaco (very simple continental breakfast that is included in our 3 day package rate). Our rate also includes daily valperetto passes which definitely comes in handy when your legs get tired from walking all day long. Our room has an inner courtyard view, and is quiet. We also ate at the restaurant at Hotel Baglioni which was also quite good. On a quiet evening, you could even hear the quartet playing outside the many cafes lining Piazza San Marco.

Our room on a corner had a lovely view from one window over a gondola station on a side canal (see photo). The room looked down on the Hard Rock Cafe but there was no significant noise.

You enjoy a normal continental breakfast at the Hotel Monaco & Grand Canal and can eat on the terrace looking straight out onto the mouth of the Grand Canal. You watch the waterbuses coming and going to the adjacent stop and the gondoliers, who have parked overnight right beside you, unpacking their gondolas ready for a day fleecing the tourists. (Ripping them off). Their is a gondola pier beside the hotel so you can watch the earliest tourists heading out as well. Breakfast itself was fine - though cover your bread basket to stop the little birds coming and helping themselves. There are a la carte breakfast items which you can add if you want more. Staff were pleasant and made no distinction in their treatment of guests from the annex.

For this reason, it sometimes feels lonely here - you only see other guests on the stairs. - no BBC on the TV! - tea-making facilities, but no milk - so you can't actually have a cuppa! - the breakfast is enough, but not the buffet style breakfast I would expect for these prices: only rolls, juice and coffee (no fresh fruit, cheeses, hams, let alone anything cooked) (unless you pay the very stiff prices of the Monaco).", "Date": "April 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wembley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPoor attitude spoiled it for me !\u201d", "Author": "Wembleygal", "ReviewID": "UR27640961", "Content": "After the positive reviews of this hotel, I was really looking forward to my stay, but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid I came away disappointed.

Firstly, the attitude of everyone who worked at the Monaco \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was like they were doing us a favour. The breakfast was dire and when we asked if we could sit on the balcony they said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no, too much bother\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. How charming. We also requested late check-out (just an hour) and were just told no. We pleaded and when one of the front-of-house staff at the Monaco was just about to give in, the Manager stepped in and stopped her. I guess it was too much bother for him too! I would have to say that the room had the best shower I have ever seen in a European hotel. It was a shame that they only provided soap, shampoo and bath gel as their amenities. And would it have killed them to have provided a flat-screen TV? The air-conditioning in the room had not been turned on yet, which meant the room was either hot and stuffy, or when the window was opened -- very nosy and smelly due to the street activity outside. Overall, I would have to say I was disappointed with Venice in general on this trip. It all seemed to be about money and how best to part the tourists from every Euro in their pocket. The service industry (both in the hotels and restaurants) has a lot to be desired and with the growing world recession, might have to change their poor attitude. .", "Date": "April 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, ON", "Title": "\u201cLoved hotel & breakfast at the Monaco!\u201d", "Author": "ashley_in_TO", "ReviewID": "UR21000709", "Content": "Lovely hotel right beside the arches to Piazza san Marco.

Breakfast which though modest for a hotel of such standing is a delight as it is served on the terrace of the Monaco which looks over the bay.

We stayed 8 nights and had a large (by European standards), well appointed room with a seating area could be moved into several positions for various uses. The huge bath was newly tiled and included a hair dryer, bidet, and a make up mirror. There was a separate closet with a safe and a small dressing area. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is just off of San Marco square, so the location is excellent. However, the hotel is difficult to locate as there is little signage. Go to the Monaco and Grand and let them take you the 2 blocks to Selvadego for your initial visit. The hotel is situated in the middle of designer shops, jewelry stores, delis, etc. The price includes a continental breakfast at the Monaco Hotel in a room overlooking the Grand Canal.

The drains gurgled through the room from 07:30, so I hope you're a heavy sleeper if you stay here! Do: look for quiet authentic family restaurants outside the busy central triangle:cheap with excellent fresh food. Do: visit the Rialto market; silk ties for 8 euros, and equally cheap scarves.

It was our first break away from our young daughters and we were looking for a centrally located quality hotel without having to break the bank. As Venice, and the hotel, was quite quiet we were given an upgrade to a huge room/suite on the top floor (712) and we were both delighted with the space and standard of the fittings. We had a double walk-in shower (with three shower heads?), double sinks and a B&O television. The location of the hotel was perfect, just a minute walk from San Marco in a doorway next to the Ermengildo Zegna shop and a couple of minutes from the Monaco hotel where breakfast was served. The view from the breakfast room at the Monaco - the Grand Canal and a gondola station - was worth the cost of the hotel alone.

It was a wonderful hotel and even in winter, walking to the Monaco (the grand sister hotel) for breakfast was no problem at all. The location is so convenient and I had no problem in using the concierge service to book concert tickets etc. Everything was as easy as possible. When leaving, the concierge at the Monaco booked our water taxi, arranged to have our luggage loaded and called us when it was all ready - to escort us to the taxi. This level of service at those prices was truly excellent. My one small gripe (and this wouldn't stop me going back) is that when we arrived, we were asked that one of us sign in and provide an imprint of a credit card. As it was my birthday gift to my husband, I took the pen to sign and got out my credit card. The concierge gave me a funny look and told me that the man must sign etc. As I had booked and paid for the whole trip myself as a gift for my lovely husband - I felt annoyed that he had to get out his credit card because mine, as a women, wasn't accepted. It made me feel like I wasn't being allowed to pay for my own gift to my husband.

You don't feel like you're staying in some stuffy hotel, you feel like you're in a real Venice apartment. The rooms - or at least our double room - are huge by European standards, almost as big an an American hotel room. Cozy even in winter with your own thermostat, big closet. Big, spacious marble bathroom with a great shower and tub. As others have mentioned, there is no room service and you have to walk to the Monaco for breakfast, but it's literally a block away. What's so great about this place for first-timers to Venice is its location, about 20 feet from Piazza San Marco. Since there are signs all over town pointing you to S Marco, you can always find your way back home. Also, it's right next to the San Marco stop for the Alileguna water bus to/from the airport. A final highlight: the friendly doormen who lend you boots when the city floods.

Overall, I was extremely impressed. Arrival was stress free, following a 40 mins Vaparetto journey from the Place de la Roma bus terminus. We alighted at St Marks jetty with the Hotel Monaco clearly in view for check in. The best thing about this hotel is its location - literally just a stones throw from St Marks in the designer shops district. Breakfast was served in the Hotel Monaco dining rooms, with views of the grand canal and gondolas bobbing on the waters. Lying in bed, you could just hear the bells ringing across the city in the morning, which was very romantic. The room was modern and very comfortable, albeit a little on the small side (my only negative comment)...with fashionable decor and a lovely bathroom/wetroom. Maybe it was just a one off, but by far the cheapest rate for this place was to be found by searching on the site that's better known as an eight legged sea creature. My one must do: get to the top of the bell tower at the end of the day as the sun is setting over a crowd free St Marks. Stunning views of Venice that we will always remember. Definately my Cary Grant moment.
