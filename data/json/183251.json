It was clean; the carpet was old but very well vacuumed. The covers were very fresh. Towels were in place and the room was pretty well dusted. 2. The price was very convenient; since I stayed over a week they offered me a weekly rate that allowed me to save some money. I was very pleased and since it is winter they come up with very low prices. 3. It is very well situated; in downtown Montreal, Quebec. Just a few minutes from the Old Port, a couple of streets bellow St. Catherine (the downtown street), close to St. Denis and Saint Laurent st. (boutiques and restaurants). 4. Staff very professional and friendly; some people are just obnoxious and this is not the case. They responded very quickly to all of my demands and even though they don't have room service nor maids (after 2PM) the receptionist did do all their best to keep me happy. Overall staying in this hotels was worth my money and while. I will definitively be coming back here and recomend it to anyone who would be passing by this city. Important points that have to be made is that (as I was explained by the staff) \"this is a budget hotel\". The breakfast is very basic, the room itself had an old design, parking was very difficult (they did help with this a lot, they even moved my car for me).

The room was clean, the bed was comfy and it was quiet. Although, the person at the front desk said that since a lot of students stay during holidays (spring break, Christmas, New Year's), it can be quite noisy at those times. It is walking distance to rue St. Denis where there are a lot of restaurants and it is only a few blocks to Parc Fontaine, which is a beautiful place to walk. It is also very close to a subway station if you prefer not to drive around the city (parking can be difficult in the city). The people at the front desk are multilingual and they are very helpful and friendly. The rooms are not equipped with a hair dryer, but if you have forgotten yours, they will loan you one. My husband and I stayed in a \"superior\" room with one double bed, desk and chair, TV and bathroom. While the size and furnishings were adequate, it is not the sort of room that you would want to necessarily lounge in and hang out; it's not luxurious or elegant. The TV was small, 17-inch or so. Since we knew that we wouldn't want to spend a lot of time in the room, this was fine for us. Our room happened to have a charming door with access to the fire escape, which I can imagine would fulfill an artistic notion of a balcony and would provide the perfect place for a late-night drink on a hot summer night. The hotel is secure; there is a buzzer for the front door even during the day, although I didn't feel like there is anything wrong with the neighborhood; Sherbrooke street is simply busy. They have made an effort to make the little lobby pleasant by putting in a water fountain. A small breakfast is provided. The hotel has an elevator. One thing to note: when I made a reservation, I was going to do it through their on-line system. The superior room was listed at $85/night. But when I got to the check-out part, the taxes and fees brought the total to $116. I know that taxes are not that high, so I called the hotel directly and made a reservation. The person quoted me a rate of $80/night and then with the normal tax rate, the total was about $93; there were no added fees. So, it is obviously to your advantage to call the hotel directly. I had called within their 72-hour time limit for cancellations, but the man did offer to change it to 48 hours for me. However, I knew that we would be there, so the $93 was charged at the time of the reservation to our credit card. Parking is on the street and is free, which is a real plus in Montreal. All in all, I would stay here again if I wanted a clean, simple, low-cost room in the city.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cClean budget hotel in a convenient location\u201d", "Author": "runawayvespa", "ReviewID": "UR103928373", "Content": "The hotel is old, but the room was sufficient size, tidy and clean.
