But the price on Expedia was not to be passed up. The hotel location is absolutelty fantastic on many levels. If you are arriving at the Termini on an airport transfer, its only 2 stops to Baberini on the Linea A, and the hotel itself is about 100 yards from the Baberini station exit (Via Veneto exit). As for sights, you can walk to any of the major sights in Rome in under 30 minutes. The trevi fountain and Spanish steps are a 10 min walk. The Pantheon on Colesseum about 25 mins and the Vatican City about 35 mins. Within this range as well are hundreds of restaurants (not all good though! see some reviews I did on those). So the location couldn't be beat in my eyes. The rooms are pretty average European hotel rooms - yes, slightly on the small side, but not horrible. I spent a bit of time in the room too, ending up having to do some work whilst there, and I never found it claustrophobic. The rooms were good quality and very clean. The bed was slightly hard, but again pretty standard for a European hotel. The included breakfast is good and lots of choice. Though annoyingly stops at 10 am - which if you are having a lie in the morning can make you feel rushed!! The service is as everyone says on here....extremely rude front desk staff. They are horrific and above all condesending. This is not typical Italian service, which can be a bit rude to begin with. Any question I had was responded to with as if I should have known the answer. And, to top it off when I asked them about booking a taxi to Fiumucino Airport, they said a taxi would cost 50 euros. Now, the standard rate to/from central Rome and FCO is 40 euros. This is a standard, legal tariff. So, I suspected the deskman was taking a 10 euro kick back from the driver. I ended up booking a Mercedes E-Class(!!) through Click Airport Transfer (www.clickairporttransfer.com) for 45 euros. Was a much nicer way to get to the airport.

As we were getting dressed for dinner my wife noticed her Calvin Klein makeup bag missing. This item was in the room 5 hours earlier because my wife had used it. The bag contained makeup items and cash. We searched the room extensively and could not find the bag. The bag was left on the desk where it had been for the past 2 days. We also noticed that our bottle of wine that we had left in the refrigerator was now sitting on top of our desk and another bottle of wine in the fridge had been disturbed. I reported the item missing to the front deskman at 6PM and asked that he call housekeeping and look into this issue for us. When we returned from dinner at 11PM the new deskman had no information for us. The following morning we left your hotel at 7:30 for a scheduled train and left a note requesting the management of the hotel contact us concerning this issue. I am now back in the United States and have heard nothing from anyone in your hotel concerning our missing property. I am prepared to file a claim with your hotel.

Roberto, Joseph, Almerica and the entire staff were always on hand to help us out. Roberto went out of his way months ago to email me about making arrangements for a papal audience and actually doing the legwork for me, emailing me several times with options and updates. We booked the audience through Vastours (watch out for them) and they FORGOT to pick us up on the morning of the audience! The bus had already left and I was left devastated and crying at the front desk because it ruined my reason for going there and my once in a lifetime opportunity to see the Pope. Almerica went into action so quickly, got into an argument with the Vastours person in the lobby for what they did to us and summoned a cab immediately to take us there. The cab got to the hotel in about 1 minute! We made it in enough time to see the Pope. On our way to Sorrento from Rome after checking out, we couldn't take the bus and called the Imperiale to arrange for a driver well after we checked out and were at Tiburtina bus station. Again, Almerica made the arrangements and a driver showed up in 20 minutes. We stayed there again on our last night from Florence to Rome to get the flight to JFK, and once again the staff went out of their way and also gave us a free upgraded room. The only downside, if there is one, is that the beds are pretty simple and apparently not great for back problem sufferers. They are two twin beds pushed together.

The hotel is RIGHT off the A line of the metro, which made going to major stops really nice and saved the feet a little, there are also bus stops on both sides of the streets, both public and tourist (I think it was 16E per person for a 24 hour pass and that goes EVERY where, just hop on and off) The Imperiale was clean and the staff was friendly, for Romans, the rooms were a good size, the only problem we had was that our room was hot- rather than complain and one of \"those\" Americans, we just opened the windows...it cooled things down and the traffic noise wasn't toooo bad. Over all a good stay, it does have internet for the cheapest we found in our hotels, 5E/hour, and the breakfast was typical European fare, the hotel resturant was right outside and had good food and wine.

We agree with those who give it a poor rating.We have stayed in many 4 star hotels across Europe and the Imperiale offering is one of the poorest.The orange juice was incredibly sweet cordial, there was only one salt pot for the entire restaurant leading to the farcical situation of the waiter spending most of his time wandering round tables looking for it!

The buffet breakfast beverages consisted of pale, watery sweet liquids that I supposewere asubstitutes for fruit juice; no fresh fruit, no one in sight to help. Also, since the room faced a shaft (which was not a problem for us, since it afforded silence) and it had only one window, it was stuffy and the air conditioning was turned off for the season. Of course, the other 94 rooms may be gorgeous, comfortable, and all one could ask for. I speak only for the room I was assigned.", "Date": "October 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely hated my experience with Hotel Imperiale\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2595479", "Content": "I had a terrible experience with this hotel.

We have stayed in wonderful Hotels in Italy and in France, which were cheaper and much more charmy and confortable than Hotel Imperiale. Okay, the Hotel has a good location and part of the staff was really nice, but the major problem is that the room in which we stayed was incredibly small (Much Smaller than the average Hotels in Europe) and HOT and when I called the reception to complain about the air conditioning, they told me that the Hotel TURNS OFF the system from 11 p.m until 7 a.m.. (EVERY NIGHT!!) The fact is that it would not be such a great problem if the temperature was below 95\u00baF outside and more than 110\u00baF inside the rooms. Another bad thing is that they keep the reception A/C system on, so that the new guests can think that the Hotel is pleasant, but, belive-me, IT REALLY IS NOT!!", "Date": "June 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel !\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1871187", "Content": "An excellent hotel. Very well located, 50 steps from the Piazza Barberini Metro stop and walking distance to the Trevi Fountain and the Stanish Steps.

The breakfast buffet was nice. The hotel is well decorated. The room also came with a great view off the private patio. We absolutely loved it. I think some people's bad reviews came from high expectations. The building this hotel is in is hundreds of years old. You cannot expect an American \"Holiday Inn\" experience out of it. We found it quaint and comfortable. The location is on Via Veneto and is unrivaled. Head to the cafe on the corner for fabulous hot chocolate. The Gazebo restaurant owned by the hotel is also great.
