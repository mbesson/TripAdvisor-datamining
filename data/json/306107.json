Unfortunately this hotel appears to have purchased beds which are made of rock, or something harder if that is possible. After a room change and about 5 (not exaggerating, it might have even been 6 or 7) mattress toppers it was still no better. We were unable to sleep and got up at the crack of dawn most days. We even had to have massages as our backs were that sore. It is a real shame as otherwise the hotel was good and the staff were about as helpful as they could be, but our relaxing trip was ruined. In the first room we thought perhaps we had been given a room with a special bed for people with back problems by mistake, only on being shown several other rooms by the accommodating manager we realized that this was the 'normal' bed.

The staff was very cooperative throughout. The reception staff was also helpful and allowed us to check in early. The room- nice enough, good view of the river. Beds were comfortable. Housekeeping was generally efficient, but they forgot to clean the room's garbage bin on two occasions (they cleaned the bathroom's, though). & I had to call them up everyday to ask for more black tea and sugar. Bathroom- Clean. Nice toiletries. Could do with better ventilation. & I'd prefer a mat on the floor in front of the bath tub rather than a towel- it used to get displaced all the time. Food at the hotel- Good, expensive as it would be in any hotel of that kind. We tried the Easter buffet- it was awesome. Breakfast is expensive if you don't book 'bed & breakfast' & there are no breakfast places around. You'll get your dinner & drinks across the river though. You just need to cross the bridge from your hotel's back entrance. On our 2nd morning, we breakfasted at Clarke Quay on our way to Sentosa & bought muffins & cakes from a Harbourfront shop for the other days. I advise trying the street stalls for other food- much cheaper but good food. Location- No MRT station. You'll need to take a bus to Clarke Quay for your Sentosa or Jurong trip. Problem is, while returning, you'll need to walk to the Boat Quay stop which is a bit far from the MRT station. You'll get buses for botanical garden & Little India in front of your hotel, for Orchard Road there's the hotel shuttle. If you are 3/4 people, take a cab for your trip to the zoo or the Flyer. It's actually cheaper & quicker. Nice walk by the river in the evenings.

Its your standard 1980's hotel which hasn't kept up with the times so probably drops a star or two every 20 years. Rooms were small but tidy, not much in the way of a minibar. Nice pool and gym and the buffet was excellent, best we have encountered. But try and book a package that gets you free breakfast as it cost us $30 SD each for breakfast!!!! A couple of decent restaurants and bars on the premises, not great food, but good for watching sport. The English isn't fantastic on the people around the concierge so don't expect any good answers to your questions. Location is decent for Singapore, easy to get around so it doesn't matter too much where you stay in the city. About a 20 min walk into the heart of the city and 10-15 min walk to the nearest Subway/Underground Train. At the end of the day it's Singapore. The city is totally overpriced and come 3 days you are totally over it and it's time to move on to the rest of Asia. Hotel wise and generally wise expect to pay a bit more and you have to realise you are not going to get the bang for your buck as you would in other destinations. And the tip of the day, if you see tons of hot chinese girls walking into a building across the road on the right which looks like a massive vegas casino, its not a casino and they are all prostitutes who don't speak english and want to find a millionaire singapore businessman!!

Staff at reception were freindly and welcoming if not very experienced. Our room at the River View was supposed to be superior but I don't know what it was superior to. The room was small and the door opened straight on to the corridor, no entrance area into the room which is common nowdays and reduces the noise from the movements of other guests. The room had not been properly cleaned after the last occupants, there were 2 jelly sweets on the floor beside the bed. The showerhead holder was broken causing it to slide down the bar, (probably not an issue if you are less that 4 foot tall) otherwise not acceptable. The grout/seal around the soap holder at the bath looked very unclean. The bed was very firm as were the pillows. We recieved a wake up call at 7.30 that was not requested or set by us. The ironing board provided was a major health and safety risk because it was prone to collapse. The decor in the room was very drab, ok if you like various shades of brown, but would definately benefit from a make over. We had a late checkout arranged but while out of the hotel during the day our key card was cancelled and had to be recoded to enable us to access the elevators to our room.

The river is beautiful and serves as the perfect view from the outside bar. The drinks are not the best, but stick to regulars and classics and you should be ok. We also had a meal at their Japanese restaurant which was packed with locals, obviously indicating that it was a popular joint Again they were friendly and offered a few different Sake's to experiment with as i was had not had it earlier.

The bus that will take you to the nearest MRT (near Clarke Quay) is bus number 52 or 59 (I can't quite remember because I never took it). Otherwise, if you don't mind hopping onto a cab,it's easily arranged. A walk down the river to Clarke Quay takes about 20 minutes. The food in the restaurant is average.

In the mornings and evenings, you can also jog along the river bank. The front desk reception is not extremely friendly but neither were they rude. There were some whom could not really understand English, which I find quite embarassing for such an establishment. (the rooms are not cheap!) The hotel pool was clean however the jacuzzi was out of order throughout my stay! That was really disappointing.

We had booked the accommodation through a travel agent and were given a package that was to include a late 4 pm checkout on the last day - this was one of the main reasons we chose this particular hotel within this price range. (We had an 8.30pm flight to Sydney) We were also apparently supposed to be \"upgraded \" to a deluxe room and receive a buffet breakfast each morning. Check in was smooth and first impressions of the hotel were good - a simple austere lobby with efficient reception staff and attentive bellboys . Our room on the 6th floor (note that deluxe rooms as per the hotel website start from level 10) was disgraceful. The carpet had not been vacuumed , there was hair in the bath and on the bathroom floor, the toilet leaked and the air conditioner's control knob was missing and therefore couldn't be adjusted. The significant issue however was that the room (level 6), which looked directly onto the pool area smelled overwhelmingly of mold, which was growing on the bathroom ceiling and in the grouting around the bath. We had also been allocated a room on a smoking floor, despite our booking having been made with a non smoking room request. After one night the smell finally got to me and my husband requested a change of room, which the reception staff to their credit organized without fuss or delay. The second room was clean, on the 9th floor, but overlooked Haverlock Road, rather than the river. It had a clean and newer bathroom without mold or the accompanying smell, and our beds were comfortable, even the roll-away for my daughter. (Incidentally, we asked about the deluxe room and were assured that this room, on Level 9, was deluxe - this is not what the hotel website reports however) Breakfast was good with the food catering for visitors from all parts of the world - staff were both friendly and helpful. We enjoyed using the pool which has fabulous views over the river, and the free shuttle service into orchard road. The Hotel is right on the river and its an easy walk down the beautiful river front to china town, Clarke quay etc. The view along the river at night is awesome. Would I stay there again - no. Cleanliness for me is a major factor when I pay for a hotel room, but especially in a city like Singapore.

The River garden is on the banks of the Singapore river and is pleasant all throughout.

How can it be chargeable even other hotels is free!! But one things that really makes me not pretty happy is the way they exchange the foreign currency. They change the money without giving me the official exchange receipt! How can it be if the hotel running the currency exchange business without giving the receipt. Even just change a small amount but is it fair to the guest??

Fuming we went back down to complain and they said they would upgrade us to a deluxe room, we requested to view it before accepting it. It was exactly the same as what we had, just not interconnecting and on the non smoking floor...?? Upgrade my [-]!!! But we took it cause we could not sleep on the smoking floor! They said they would do something for us tomorrow (yyssw, nothing happened). So we got to our new rooms and unpacked. The bathrooms needed a blooming good clean, they looked dirty, i unwrapped a glass and it had fingerprints all over it and did not look clean at all! The kicker was the beds were hard, but I was soo tired I did not care at this stage. Definately the worst hotel of my holiday. The best thing of this hotel is the restaurant. We had great food, all presented well. Fast service. It was the saving grace of our stay here! A-le-carte is 50% off on SSH too, which was excellent. Taxis waiting at the door are cheap to go anywhere too. Loved singapore, just not from this hotel... maybe I was expecting more...???

We paid $498 AUD for the 3 nights. We were travelling with our 2 year old son and they didn't charge for him. We had 2 King Single beds pushed together, which gave us enough room for the 3 of us to sleep together for the 3 nights. (Not everone's cup of tea, but for a few nights, it's didn't bother us) We were on the 10th floor and had a lovely view up the River. The room was clean, modern, with a flat screen TV and a good size by Singaporean standards. It looks like the room had been newly refurbished. There was a good shower (always an essential after a long flight) There was a safe in the room, a small fridge & kettle, but strangely no coffee, tea, sugar or milk!!! We had the hot buffet breakfast the first morning at $25 SGD each. There were both Asian and Western style foods available and lots of staff on hand to assist. We were the only Western people in the room. I believe they normally have the breakfasts downstairs in a room overlooking the River, but this was being refurbished whilst we were there, so we were in a closed-in function room on the third floor. The Coffee shop downstairs was also being re-furbished, but it would have been lovely overlooking the River. On our two free days in Singapore we used the Taxi's because they are cheap, convenient with a young one and you could catch it right out the front of the hotel. We went to Sentosa Island one day and it cost us $7 SGD to Mt Faber, where we caught the cable car over to the island. On the second day, we went to Singapore Zoo and it cost $15 SGD by taxi. The Hotel has a free shuttle bus to take you to Orchard Rd for shopping. Not sure how convenient the Hotel is to MRT, as we chose to use Taxi's for our short stay, but you could always catch the shuttle bus to Orchard Rd and then catch the MRT from there.

It is on the river, with pleasant walks along the banks in both directions. We had booked a triple room which was a twin with an extra bed for our son, and the room was large, well furnished, and on the 6th floor, with views over a small park rather than the river. The staff were mainly Chinese, helpful and friendly, and we all enjoyed the dinner in the garden restaurant which offered a choice of Malaysian, Chinese and Indonesian food. There were two or three more restaurants on other floors. Breakfasts were hot and cold buffet style and had both western and chinese dishes. There was a notice in the room to tell the guest about impromptu fumigations, but obviously there had not been one for a few days or they had missed the live cockroach which our son found in a towel on our second day. This was slightly off-putting especially as it had not been cleared away when we returned at a later stage. As the metro was a good walk away, and we only had two days in which to see everything, we opted to take taxis everywhere. These are cheap and plentiful, and have chatty informative drivers. We enjoyed the hotel's swimming pool which was several floors up, so you got a view of the skyscrapers whilst swimming. There was also a gym but we didn't use it.

I had been several times to Singapore before and had some remembering on the fassade of a hotel, which I believed was this hotel (in fact it wasn't). As compared to the other hotels where I already was staying during my Singapore visits this hotel cannot match with them. It already starts with Internet booking. I did get no confirmation or reply on my Internet booking done on the hotel's Internet booking page, despite the form was properly filled in and sent out without any error message. After some days I called them and they told me, that there was no Internet booking visible to them (???). The standard double room is quite small. Arriving late in the night I had to see that the linen in the bed had three brownish nodes, which seemed to have \"survived\" washing. If you want to go into Internet with the wireless keyboard on the TV-screen, they charge you full! You also cannot download from Internet or watch TV at the same time. When going to breakfast I was negatively surprised, since it turned out that you are charged separately for it. The breakfast buffet is not worth the price (46 SGD for 2 persons). It is quite small and e.g. the corned beef was like coming freshly out of the can. The servants seem not to be really happy with their work. Moreover you are feeling that they are watching you with suspicion, fearing you would take something from e.g. American breakfast when you just were paying for European breakfast. The last day I got the coffee served to the table. Unfortunately the coffee was already cold until the rolls and the as-cold toast were served (they did not allow me to serve myself?). Another (negative) surprise came on payment. I assumed during Internet booking that the shown room price was all-inclusive. But in fact a service-charge is extra added (10% of room) along with some other fees (room CESS and room GST) and finally the ordinary tax (GST). Good in this hotel is that you can let your luggage in the hotel after check-out for later pick-up.
