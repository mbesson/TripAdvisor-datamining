Do not choose this hotel if you have a tendency towards claustrofobicness. You really feel incapsulated in this hotel, all doors are electrically operated and windows opens only a little. I wondered what happens under a fire or an electricity power cut. No way doors an windows will allowe you to escape if the automatic systems fails. As my headline says the 3 course dinner was really lousy. On top on bad quality the courses were very small and we went to a nearby cafe to have some more to eat. The french wine recomended to us by the waiter (25 euro) was poor quality and we found the same in the ground floor supermarket at a price of about 2-3 euro. Last a funny thing! After having booked our stay we received an email with a document for printing attached. On the document was printed \"Voucher\" followed by a reference number. When we presented this document at the reception the young lady there told us: this is not the voucher, I replyed yes this is the voucher because it says so in the document, the young lady again stated: no this is not a voucher.

The second room was large and luxurious, and everything was nice, new and clean. There is a large supermarket on the ground floor where you can stack up on fresh fruits, beer/wine, sweets etc. The hotel foyer includes a lagre smoking section which you pass on the way to the restaurant and bar, and it is definately not nice to have to smell smoke every time you walk by. But just don't linger and it's no big problem.The bar is tended by a very nice and friendly staffmember, and it was cosy to sit by the fireplace and enjoy our drinks, (maybe a little bit annoying that a tv screen was constantly blasting flickering pictures (soccer) right in the middle of the lounge section). The food is definately not anything to get exited over - we had an included 3 course set menu at the hotel which they kindly made vegetarian for me and my travelpartner, but it was just dull, unimaginative, covered in salt and grease and basically the worst food we got during our entire stay. So we didn't bother eating at the hotel again, but luckily there are som good restaurants near by and finding tasty food was no problem. The continental breakfast at the hotel is served in nice surroundings, the food is very classic (dull and includes rubbery cheese, hardboiled eggs, very processed and massproduced foods, but displayed nicely and presented professionally). Apart from one staffmember on one occasion misguiding me to a museum which turned out to be closed that day, my impression af the people working there is that they are friendly, professional and helpfull.

The hotel itself is very new (so new that most Internet ariel views are of barren wasteland!), and is built to a good standard, situated above a brand new supermarket and shopping mall (the hotel occupies the 2nd and 3rd floors, with reception on the 2nd floor). The lobby is breathtaking when you first encounter it. The staff were all friendly and very helpful, nothing was too much trouble for them. The room itself was larger than I expected, and very nicely equipped with a very comfortable bed, chairs, work desk (of good seize) and the inevitable overpriced minibar. Bathroom has toilet, good basin and a shower (no bath), although the design of the shower screen and seal suggests the bathroom floor will get very wet after a few months as the seal wears out - a minor detail but something to watch for. WiFi is available for free via a unique username/password which you get from reception - note it will only work or a single device, so if you have say a laptop and an iPad or iPhone you will need to ask them for 2 access codes - which the hotel provided without any problems, but just something to note. The breakfast, a little on the pricey side but within normal hotel range, was the usual buffet affair with plenty of choice of cereals, cooked breakfast, breads, pastries, cold meats, cheeses and fruits; certainly enough to set one up for the day, and all served in a spacious, bright and airy restaurant. The evening meal selection, however, was rather sparse on the one night we ate there, a very limited menu which was frankly a little disappointing. On the plus side there are plenty of good places to eat near-by covering most price ranges, and the hotel staff were very happy to make suggestions and recommendations. On one of the nights the hotel suffered a failure of their boilers which meant no heating and no hot water for a night, a bit inconvenient but outwit their control. They got it fixed and gave everyone a free drink at the bar plus a complimentary room upgrade on next stay. Checkout was easy, I did mine the night before due to a VERY early start. Getting a taxi is very easy - reception press a button and a taxi is waiting for you downstairs within 4 minutes, day or night!

This is one stop, or a 10 minute brisk walk away. I thought the hotel was first class, the staff always very helpful and friendly and the room excellent. There is free internet, the bathrooms are good with nice products. The hotel is strange at first in that there a massive enclosed internal courtyard with water features. Our room was on the quiet inside and we heard nothing. We had a large room despite only paying for a standard possibly (though not just) because I was a member of BW's reward scheme. I didn't eat in the hotel, however we paid more than 13 euros for breakfast in Berlin. Sunday brunches can be a little fancy in Berlin. The transport from the hotel is great, and if you are off to the east or other parts of the centre, it can be quicker to take the train up to Leopoldstrasse. One of the best reasons to stop at this hotel is that despite being in a residential neighbourhood there are some lovely and very good value eating and drinking options in the area. We ate dinner and lunch at Lichtblick, along near the U-bahn station. IIt was wonderful, mains from 7-15 euros and beers as little as 2.50 Euro for large. Very good quality food and excellent service, they do breakfast on Sundays as well. We also ate breakfast in Arema, an older more traditional bar/restaurant. Traditional german breakfast for 8 euros. Excellent value. You could add a glass of fizz if you want to for a euro. Also the large kebab shop near Arema was nice and opened late. On my first night the people from the bar directed me to this, saying they ate there, as they had stopped serving food at 11pm.There is also a small bakery doing among other things sandwiches and nice cakes, making it a good value. I didn't find a safe looking cash machine available nearby, I think because the shopping centre (postbank) and supermarket was closed and ended up at Turmstrasse at night. It didn't feel too bad, but I have lived in inner cities and am 6'2\" and very large build, so I tend to not bother too much. I would get the bus to Turmstrasse unless you are nervous about travelling on your own, as my cab to the hotel from Hauptbahnof took a scenic route at over 7euros. Also worth noting that cabs are expensive in Berlin as it is a big city, much more like London than say Hamburg or Amsterdam and very spread out. One last tip is remember the size of the city and make allowances for travelling time, it is a large city and takes time to navigate.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cA great option for visitors to Berlin\u201d", "Author": "JJJR", "ReviewID": "UR120192638", "Content": "We stayed for two nights at this hotel and were very impressed.

In addition, the hotel is above a really big Edeka supermarket that sells everything that you'd might like to buy to make your visit more comfortable. The room is modern, clean and well decorated, and the bathroom is new and comfortable as well. The room has a mini fridge containing a few minibar items, but you can easily go down to the supermarket and maybe buy a few drinks, milk or yoghurt and store them in the fridge as well, to save some money. In addition, our room had free wireless internet which was very easy to connect to, and was a very fast speed. We arrived by Tegel airport and it was very easy to reach this hotel via bus 109 to Zoologischer Garten and then taking the U9 U-Bahn to Birkenstrasse. In addition you can take X9 to Zoologischer Garten S- and U-Bahn or TXL to Alexanderplatz S- and U-Bahn. The staff were very polite, friendly and helpful and the lobby is also a lovely sight.

Highlights of the trip were the open top bus tour (excellent value for money), 'Topography of terror' (a free museum) and the Berlin walks 'Buildings of the Third Reich' (Finn you are a great guide and made the walk educational and entertaining).
