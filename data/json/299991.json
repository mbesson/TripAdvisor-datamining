{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Fascinating It's just off Ku'dam, near the Uhlandstrasse U-bahn. Bus from Tegel drops you off at Bleibtreustrasse. It's run by very interesting Polish woman, ex-model , now dedicated to restoring Berlin's neglected fountains. Kettler is full of art works and antiques. Rooms are themed to commemorate artists and performers. I've stayed in the Callas Room - huge bed - and am re-booked in the Toulouse Lautrec Room. You're welcomed with a half bottle of wine - I had an excellent Chablis. No loos in the rooms, but each one has its own eccentric shower. Excellent breakfast. Very comfortable and unusual place to stay. Beats all the identikit, cloned modern hotels. I Love It!", "Date": "Oct 1, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR574038795", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "htraneP"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d299991-r5897060-Kettler_Pension-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "299991", "Price": "$56"}}
