We arrived around 3/4pm to check in. Our room was not ready and we were told to wait without being offered a drink despite the staff knowing that we had travelled from London and were exhausted. When we asked about being allocated a room with a view we were told these rooms were charged at a higher rate than the smoking room we had been allocated. A member of our party has severe asthma and at the time of our booking with Hotels.com no option was provided to pick a non-smoking room. Unfortunately the staff at the front desk were initially not very accommodating and insisted that we could stay in the room allocated; pay an upgrade fee for another room or find somewhere else to stay. Having travelled a fair bit and being Hilton Honours Members we found this to be unacceptable. We told staff we would wait for our room to be prepped and if the smoke was too bad we would consider paying the upgrade fee. After around 30 minutes of waiting we asked whether we could be offered a drink as we were very tired. We were shown into the hotel restaurant and by some stroke of good fortune here we met Peter the General Manager of the hotel and from hereon our luck changed. Peter was AMAZING. We were offered complimentary drinks and he joined us at our table to advise us of places to visit and things to do during our stay. We told Peter of our problem with the smoking room and without a second thought he walked into the reception area and returned within minutes to tell us he had changed our room without charge. We were shown to our room shortly thereafter and were given the Hilton cookies everyone raves about. They weren't warm but they were yummy. The room was adequately sized with great views of the Empire State Building. The beds were comfortable and the sheets were clean although the quilt / bedding could have been cleaner! The tv was a 42\" flat screen and a small amount of storage space was provided with a safe which we did use during our trip. The bathroom was clean with great complimentary toiletries. However, the fixtures and fitting were tired looking and needed a once over. The hotel is located within a few minutes walk of 28th St subway (on the red line) and 34th Penn station (on the red and blue lines) which is very handy. All of the major sites are a short train ride away and as the hotel is away from the crazy hustle and bustle it is in the perfect location. The following morning there was no water in the shower. We were told this was due to a fire in the area and were offered a complimentary breakfast. The food options were limited but the staff did make us toast and bring us peanut butter when we asked which was brilliant. Peter then joined us at our table to help us plan our itinerary. We do think that a lot of the staff noted that Peter was taking care of us and perhaps this is why they were overly nice to us during our trip?! Can't say for certain but we certainly received a warmer welcome than the one we recieved when we first arrived. Despite the above we can say we received exceptional service during our stay by those members of the Hilton Team who took time out to talk to us. Peter is amazing and thanks to him and his suggestions we had a fantastic stay in NYC and at the Hilton Doubletree Chelsea. Ben at the concierge desk was super friendly with helpful suggestions about what to do. He was very charming and funny and certainly brightened our mornings. Miguel who is usually at the hotel in the evenings is one of the nicest people you will meet! He too was very helpful with suggestions on where to go and where not to go; he gave us more warm cookies without us asking; helped us find pizza at 2am and had this sent to our room and when a member of our party was unwell during the last night of our stay he immediately went to a nearby store and brought her tea with Lemon and Honey and brought this to our room. This was truly exceptional service and we can't than Miguel enough for this. Cathy was also very helpful so a special thanks to her also. All in all we will definitely be back to stay. However next time we will be sure to email the hotel in advance to secure a non-smoking room. A big thank you to Peter, Miguel, Ben and Cathy. You turned our trip from a good one into a great one.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat weekend, great location . . .\u201d", "Author": "NikonD5000", "ReviewID": "UR126119119", "Content": "My wife and I spent last weekend at the Doubletree Chelsea. For our purposes it was perfectly located -- we walked the three blocks from Penn Station after arriving on Amtrak. From the hotel we walked to Times Square (to the TKTS booth and Colony Music), to the Highline, to the FIT Museum, to the Chelsea art district, and (on our last night) to Eataly down on 5th and 23rd. For everything else (Greenwich Village and Soho) we took the subway -- the 1 train on 7th Avenue and the N train on Broadway -- both with stations only two blocks away. We arrived at 11 AM but the very courteous people at the front desk in the tiny lobby found a room for us right away. We were up on the 19th floor in the back. No exterior noise at all, except for a couple of faint sirens. The room was New-York-snug and had only one chair (at the desk) but the bed was super comfortable and getting hot water in the bathroom and shower was almost instantaneous. And since I'm used to hotel and motel showers that spray directly into my chest (I'm 6'4\"), it was nice to be able to stand directly under this one. One gripe is that there isn't much room for toiletries. For us it was mostly a place to sleep -- or, given all the walking we did, to collapse. Never even turned on the TV. For breakfast we ate at Guy & Gallard down the street the first morning and at the hotel the second. Preferred the G&G but the hotel one was fine. The only real complaint was that we could hear people talking in the corridor pretty clearly -- even to follow their jokes! We had a couple of rooms of twenty-somethings down the hall who were noisily preparing for a night out (I think they propped their doors open) and I was concerned about the noise they'd make when they returned, especially late. But either I slept through it or they were respectful and quiet. Still, it could be an issue. I'm surprised that nobody's mentioned that the hotel is in -- or at the southern edge of -- the Garment District. The blocks around it are lined with shops selling purses (mostly from China), wigs, belts, and other fashion items. The shops are definitely not glitzy and some sell only to the trade but I had trouble getting my wife to pass some of them by -- even when we were setting off to visit Mood's, the fabric supplier of Project Runway (eight blocks away). And one block south (28th Street) is the Flower District. The room was spotless, the bath towels big and fluffy, and the elevators (once they arrived -- there are only two) quiet and quick. I take lots of pictures (in this case, more than 600 in two days) and I love urban streetscapes. The Doubletree's neighborhood isn't pretty but for me at least it was a great place to walk around and shoot all the restaurants, delis, garment shops, flower sellers, neon signs, iconic rooftop water tanks, and subway stations, as well as the people who were passing by. Even at night. The next time we go to New York (we go once every year or two), the Doubletree will definitely be the first place we consider staying at.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ayr, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cfantastic location great staff\u201d", "Author": "nicola d", "ReviewID": "UR126057419", "Content": "i stayed at the double tree in chelsea nyc for 4 nights last week....

(Family of 3 from Scotland, UK...we stay in a small village) I was delighted of our choice of Doubletree Chelsea....and Eva made us feel most welcome. Our request of high floor was honoured...we were on 26th floor and had a good nights sleep. To begin with we did have jet lag that did effect our sleep. I looked out the window and saw a stream of yellow cabs and a view of the Empire State Building. How amazing was that. Yes there are only 2 lifts but we were never really inconvenienced by this. Apparently there are 33000 yellow cabs in N Y. 192 Starbucks in Manhattan. (think that's what the tour guy said) - We saw lots and had lattes in quite a few Starbucks! Although the room was compact...it had 2 double beds, nicely furnished and most important spotless. The beds were sooo comfy. So thanks to your cleaning team. Again the bathroom was very clean and lovely complimentary toiletries. Towels were super clean, white and soft. The staff were always courteous and friendly towards us and you felt they wanted us to be having a good time. Any snacks we had from the restaurant were delicious. French fries, grilled cheese sandwich. We flew from Edinburgh, UK to Newark International. We got the Air-train, then train to Penn Station...was easy walk to hotel. $12:50 each. Train journey took 25 mins. Return journey - Frenz? (I think was his name) was great the bell-hop guy and organised a car for us $80 including tips and tolls. Service was efficient and it took under 30 mins to get to the airport. The traffic was very good, We left 3:30pm on Sunday afternoon. Our flight was at 7:38pm. Well what can I say about New York! - We visited Times Square first thing last Thursday and were too early to pick up our 9am Uptown Bus Tour - We stumbled on the Good Morning America Tv Studio and saw the Desperate Housewives Men on the couch and coming out of the side TV door. My daughter, age 13 was totally star struck. We did the NYC sight seeing tour (3 days for price of 2).......didn't manage to do all the tours but did Uptown, Downtown, Night Tour and ferry to Statue of Liberty. We got off at Ellis Island for history lesson. Ticket also included a visit to Empire State Building and we were so lucky with the beautifal weather. Security checks very tight for ferry and Empire State so will take time...we went early for 8am. The 9/11 memorial was so sad and moving....you can reserve passes on line which are free. Again tight security checks. If you are a' Real Housewives of New York' fan the downtown tour bus does stop off at Zarin Fabrics. Unfortunately we missed our stop....wished we had got off! We were there for 4 nights....just so much to do, so little time. We had breakfast one morning in Amy's bakery, Greenwich Village...very nice.....However please note shops won't open there til 11am....we were too early for Juicy Couture. Shops in Soho were fab and a latte at Dean & Delucca was lovely and lovely ambience. Would I go back to Doubletree Chelsea - Yes absolutely in a hearbeat. We loved the location too. Times Square would be too touristy and busy for us. Well done to you all! Great Customer service and teamwork. Can't wait to return.

The beds are soooooo comfortable with down feather pillows - I get great sleep every night. The restaurant has a nice selection of appetizers, main courses and desserts. I would recommend the salmon(delicious). The servers go out of their way to smile and take care of your needs. Yes, there are only 2 elevators but you know what?? I have NEVER had to wait very long for them and they are fast to the floor requested. Overall, the General Manager has put together a group of hard working and caring employees that separates this hotel from many many others.

The first thing, that set a fairly bad note, was that the hallway on my floor STUNK. Like a bunch of bums were living in the hallway. Also, my room did not have a desk chair. So on our way to dinner, we let the front desk know that they needed to fix these things. They did fix these two problems, mostly. The chair was not an executive style chair they claimed to have, but the smell in the hallway did mercifully abate. Also, note that the smell did not infiltrate our room. The room was actually quite comfortable, clean with pleasing amenities and nice bed. There was even a view of the Empire State Building. There were a number of close by good restaurants in Chelsea. The next day, I decided to work from the room. They refused to let us have 2 chairs in the room, so my partner was relegated to working on the bed. This room is not really big enough for 2 people to work in it, I found out. Further, the internet ($10/day) did not work reliably - it cut out for about 30 minutes on a couple of occasions. Also, the cleaning staff seemed to be using the guest room being cleaned right next to ours as a sort of rest area, and were spending a lot of time going in an out, right next to where we were working. So working in the room was actually rather loud and disrupted through the day. The restaurant downstairs was sufficient to have guests for drinks, but really not a very good place to bring anyone other than a good friend or casual guest.

The towels were thick enough to absorb water, not the thin ones in cheaper hotels. Climate control via the thermostat worked well. I'm a federal govt employee and we used the govt leisure travel rate for a room with 2 double beds (about $143 excluding taxes). Standard rate also is reasonable for NYC, about $168, I believe. We had breakfast there the next day and the waitress was super-friendly and accomodating. Checkout is noon and the hotel was glad to keep our bags until 5:00PM when we had to catch our return bus. Everyone (front desk, bellhop, waitress) was very friendly and helpful. The only (slight) drawbacks were the pillows (no support) and low water pressure (fine for me but ladies washing their hair probably would prefer stronger).

After a particularly long journey from London to JFK and then another long cab ride from JFK to DoubleTree Chelsea, I was sincerely hoping this hotel lived up to my expectations. As a very loyal Hilton brand customer, I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. Firstly, the good points: 1.) Location - right in the heart of Manhattan, although advertised as \"Chelsea\", it felt more like Koreatown when you look at the neighbouring businesses. Saying that, I still felt safe walking alone there at night, and its minutes away from a subway station that will whisk you anywhere. 2.) The Views - Our room had a view of the Empire State Building and the rooftops of lower Manhattan, seriously impressive even for a second time NYC visitor. 3.) THE BAR - It's true that America runs on good service, and in the Doubltree Hotel Chelsea, this is no exception. An all round good service from the staff there (I can only hope the young man that served me over the course of the few nights still works there, he was a credit to the Doubltree brand and well deserved his nice tip we left him when leaving from our stay). Great place to just relax, talk to fellow guests and watch some games on the TV. 4.) Our room - clean, spacious (even for NYC standards), with very, very, very comfortable beds guaranteeing a good nights sleep. Toiletries restocked daily as they should be, room cleaned and bathroom was always immaculate. Great TV to pass a few hours in the morning getting ready to go out. 5.) Gym and Business Centre - perfect for an early morning catch up with Facebook and emails, and a quick jog on the treadmill to wake up your day. Clean and odorless. Now, just a few negatives: 1.) Noise - being in the location its in, even with a high floor room, we never managed to escape the nighttime noise of Manhattan with sirens at all hours - not a fault of the hotel, but should be considered if you are staying here and are a light sleeper as my companion found out. 2.) Our second night of the stay was slightly jarred by an unannounced knock on the door at 3am with a delivery of \"additional coffee supplies\" we had apparently ordered - the front desk staff admitted their mistake upon talking to them about it at 9am, and prompty apologised and issued us with two free breakfast vouchers. So well done management for sorting that out and providing good customer service. Minus the small negative points, all in all a very pleasing stay at a lovely hotel - I will be back in a few months upon my next trip to NYC (March 2012) and cannot wait to return.

When I am staying in Chelsa this is one of my favorites and I actually now look for it because it is a very plesant stay. Yes the rooms are small but they are comfortable and the lighting is ok. (Lots of hotels seems to be leaving out the lights these days.) The beds are super comfortable in this hotel which is a bibg plus for me. The staff also goes out of their way to try and be plesant and helpful. ALways responsive to requests. The immediate neightborhood is not the fanciest but if you look around and are willing to walk a bit or get in a cab there are good restaurants within a reasonable distance. The actual street the hotel is not is not much for the way of anything that you would ever want to go to for food, shopping, etc. But you are right between 6th and 7th avenues and there more there. The elevators are not super fast. So a personal tip is I try to get mid-rise floor so I am above street noise and high enough to be able to get into the elevators during the morning rush. There are only two and they are slower. What's best about the hotel is the price. I shop around for good prices and good places and this hotel is always on the list of places I look. Sometimes the price shoots way up and I will shop around for another place -- this coming week I am staying a few blocks away at a competitor because the price was $100 cheeper but on my prior stay it was the Double Tree that was $50 less than anything else I found. The desk, work space is good too and a nice big TV. That;s about it for the room though. So if you are looking to spread out or settle in a big comfy chair look elsewhere.

This wasn't the case, it was my same sexed friend and her child and myself and my child. So I had to sleep on the pull out couch with my daughter and gave my friend the bed. Not a huge deal, the pull out was not that uncomfortable. However, they did not have the bedding in the room and I had to call for it. It was about 11pm at night, we were ready for bed and it took almost 30 minutes for them to bring it up (they had to come twice, brought only towels the first time) and then we were only given sheets.

Why is it that mid-priced hotels provided these nice perks but higher-line properties (at least in NYC) force me to search for coffee and paper every morning? Go figure. The immediate neighborhood left a little to be desired. There was a homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk next door to the hotel and 29th St. is a little dark at night, with little foot traffic.This left my wife feeling a little uneasy, however we were with another couple and did not feel threatened (safety in numbers).

It was 90 degress when we were there. Reception was pokey and dull and the sofas could do with a clean, we never went to gym just didnt have the time. We never went into restaurant to eat as prices seemed very expensive. When I first arrived I discovered my daughter had left a bag at the airport I asked recpetion if I could call the airport and the first person was very rude and said no I couldnt use the phone! I was most upset I left the hotel for a few hours I was tired and fed up, I tried to use my mobile out there but I just couldnt get threw to lost property at Newark, Came back to the hotel and asked a differnt person and he said yes. Any way didnt get the bag back, nor did lost property return my call. I didnt expect to get the bag back but a call would have been nice. New York city is like London on speed, Its crazy, Funny, and nothing surpries me any more, Beggers with no legs busking, singers, a crazy guy of times sq banging a saucepan lid? Empire state was a 2 hr Q. statue of liberty 2 hr q. Rockafella centre about 45 mins, NBC studio tour sold out 2 days in advance so pre booked, we had the city pass. Ground zero just made us cry. Stardust dinner very good food and singing, just a shame they ask for such big tips. Planet hollywood good grub too, only if you use your city pass to get your $10 dollars off they change 18% tip!. plus did all the shops, best for bargins was forever21 but got some good ones in jcpenny and tj max. wanna go back in winter to see what central park is like then its so well kept. but would proably stay else where. On my return home asked the hotel to book my shuttle bus, they got the date wrong and did it for 24 hrs after my plane took off. I went and asked on the Tuesday for a shuttle bus to be booked for the next day which would mean Wednesday yes? No the lady booked it for Thursday and a time I would have been in the UK! Didnt relaise until i questioned her when bus was 20 mins late. Another bus couldnt be booked so I had to get a taxi and I had to pay the $88 not the last impression I wanted of New York Double Tree Chelsea!", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Racine, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel in Chelsea.\u201d", "Author": "GlobalMogul", "ReviewID": "UR110400065", "Content": "I had the opportunity to stay at this property in May 2011 while in town for the BookExpo America show.

This made the foyer area very dark, dingy and uninviting - it's incredibly small anyone so immediate feeling wasn't good. Staff at check in where pleasant, but on getting to our room there wasn't any bedding for the sofa bed. When we pulled the bed out there wasn't enough room to move between bed and door without moving an exceptionally heavy coffee table. Unlike the hotel in Boston no-one put the sofa bed up in the evening, which would have been nice. After the shops/offices have closed the street is very quiet and we were approached several times for change, not sure if there was a soup kitchen or shelter close by but there seemed to be a lot of homeless people. We stayed in New York on four occasions and this was the worst hotel of all, we'll be moving uptown or further downtown next time. Cleanliness wasn't brilliant either, the bathtub was full of hair, as was the bathroom floor and we had to request toilet rolls too. There are vending machines located on several floors, but our floor wasn't operative when we arrived; we met a very nice lady who was going up and down in the lift trying to find drinks and ice. The hotel seemed very busy and going up and down from the 25th floor was a slow process at busy times like check in and out.

I arrived, only to discover that parking was on another avenue entirely -- another fact not advertised at all on their site. But OK, an annoying inconvenience, but I parked, and then when I needed to leave an hour later, I was informed that I would have to pay $22 *every time* I left and came back. The other DoubleTree locations on their website (doubletree.hilton.com) are quite explicit that in/out is not allowed, for example: Parking: Self Parking:35.00 USD per 24hrs:No in/out However, the Chelsea location does NOT include this caveat, which is why I chose it! I complained to the manager, who implied I was a fool for thinking *any* Manhattan hotel would have in/out parking regardless of what might be advertised, claimed he wasn't responsible for what the website said because it was \"run by Hilton, not Doubletree\" (which is ridiculous, since it is a Hilton franchise), and refused to limit the charge to the advertised $22. So I wound up paying hundreds of dollars more money than I had planned on (between taxis and extra parking fees) because of Doubletree's false advertising and the manager's refusal to adhere to advertised terms. In the end, I was left to tell the manager I would leave a 1-star review for his hotel because of the horrible service, and he said to go ahead -- so that's what this is, because one star accurately represents their false advertising, terrible and insulting service, and the fact I wound up spending much more money than they had led me to understand I would.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Monica", "Title": "\u201cGreat location but extremely slow elevators!\u201d", "Author": "cruisernut", "ReviewID": "UR100770781", "Content": "We stayed here for a quick weekend shopping trip and the hotel is ideally situated close to Penn station, subway, and stores.

Not only do you get bad wet eggs, coffee and soggy french toast but you get additional tax on your hotel taxes too more than if you went outside of the hotel. I recommend walking towards 7th Ave. and on either corners of the street are two great places (Cafe Guy & Gallard on one side and a deli on the other) that have a good lox and bagal or egg breakfast sandwiches and a good cup of Joe for $6.50!

If you are not a big walker the bellmen are more than willing to help with a taxi. The staff was very pleasant and helpful without being overwhelming. The young lady who checked us in was an embodiment of that pleasant personna. Warm cookies on check in was a nice touch. Wall Street Journal available on Saturday. There is a small gym in the basement with new Precor equipment that was functional and up to par. Each unit has its own TV screen. The negatives mentioned in other reviews: The hotel elevators could be slow particularly at the more travelled times which can be expected. In the evenings and mornings when we come and go usually before or after the crowds we didn't find much problem. The room was small but as a place to sleep and change it was more then adequate. The room itself was very clean and comfortable. Flat screen TV, view of the Empire State Building, comfortable bed and very quiet for sleeping. The location is on a quiet street that can seem imposing in the late evening but as frequent travellers to the city and this area it isn't what it may look like. It is a shorter walk to come in from 6th ave to the hotel but we have never had a problem in this area. In the end a nice hotel with a nice staff.

Unfortunately the Doubletree Chelsea suffers the opposite problem. The hotel and rooms are recently refurbished to a high standard, but the attitude of staff make staying difficult and uncomfortable. To start with the positives, the hotel is well located, just round the corner from Madison Square Gardens and Macy's. The rooms are a decent size, recently refurbished and clean, although I practically choked on air freshener when I first walked in. The 200 or so rooms are only served by two lifts, but the wait isn't too protracted. The staff are (for the most part) friendly and can handle most requests. However it is the unprofessionalism and lack of forethought that make staying at this hotel a struggle. When we arrived, our room not ready, and reception couldn't even tell us when it would be. Not what you need after a transatlantic flight. The staff were unable to manage my reservation properly, because I'd booked two consecutive nights separately, and made me check in again all over again the next day. To exacerbate this, they didn't think to update our key cards, leaving us locked out of our room. Finally there was a very noisy, industrial-sized ice machine next to our room, which stopped my girlfriend from sleeping. She asked repeatedly for it to be turned off, which never happened, until I found a simple switch and did it myself. In summary the staff can be friendly and the hotel is nice, but this is not a relaxing, carefree place to stay, because you have to do all the work yourself.

Did I make the wrong hotel choice? For me, the answer is YES. For others, maybe not. This property was originally built as a condo development and the design flaws therein are self-evident. This place would have been called a \"traveler's hotel\" when that term was widely used to describe lower-end, budget hotels that had a high transient rate. But let me start with the positives. The staff was gracious, polite, professional and helpful. The hotel and rooms are clean. The bed was comfortable and there is a large flat screen TV in each room. It has windows that open enough for fresh air. The climate control works well. The street is very quiet for Manhattan. So, in essence, this is a very nice BUDGET hotel. Now here's the problem - I don't consider Doubletree to be a budget chain and I hadn't planned in staying in one on this trip. I've stayed in tons of Doubletrees, mostly on the West Coast. They tend to be comfortable, upscale properties. Not this one in New York's Chelsea neighborhood. This one has budget written all over it, from the tiny lobby to the two overworked elevators to the tiny hallways and tiny rooms. Not only are the hallways tiny, but the noise is awful. People slamming doors and talking loudly like they're right outside your door. It reminded me of living in a dorm or rooming house.

But there are much worse things to happen, I got over it. So I had a great stay. The only real complaint I have is that this hotel is NOT in Chelsea. It is a short walk to Chelsea. It is also a very short walk to Penn Station which is convenient. But if you are looking for Chelsea specifically, be warned this hotel is about 5 blocks north and 2 blocks east of anything truly \"Chelsea\". This hotel's actual street is NOT sketchy or dangerous, like some people have suggested, it is a perfectly fine street. But it is a completely bland street, there is literally nothing of interest on the block. When walking home at night, you will find yourself walking away from interesting neighborhoods into a very bland generic empty dark street, with mostly closed shops, and the Doubletree, and nothing else. But it's a great value, great amenities for VIPs, and it was new and clean and modern, plenty of outlets, etc. The rooms are typical NYC rooms - small. But they aren't outrageously small, and they definitely are not the smallest rooms I've ever seen in NYC. Try staying at the Paramount or the Hudson - you'll learn what small rooms are. These rooms are very typical european/nyc-sized. And, I saw two rooms, both about the same size, one king, and one double-double, and there wasn't a lot of room to walk around but enough.

There is a subway stop just around the corner (28th Street), and Penn Station is a short walk of five blocks, or so. We were able to use the hotel as a good base for our stay to take the subway to certain locations or walk to others. We drove into the city, and the hotel is only about 10 blocks from the Lincoln Tunnel, so that was convenient, as well. Since parking in New York is very expensive, we were very happy to find out that the Doubletree had self parking about two blocks away for just $22 per 24 hours. The hotel itself is in very good condition and has average size (small) rooms for New York City. We did have a nice view of the Empire State Building, which was nice. While the room is small, it has all of the usual amenities one would expect from a Doubletree, and we had a very comfortable bed with plenty of pillows.

We were a party of 4 with major luggage & were able to fit into the elevator. There are about 7 rooms to a floor and we never heard our neighbors. We did hear the ice machine, but our room was right next to it. It was a little noisy, but it did not keep us from sleeping. Nice Neutrogena products in the bathroom and wonderful beds and pillows...like sleeping on a cloud. Air con was a dream. No smells, our room very clean. I wonder if this is just hit or miss. We were on the street side, but no noise. Here are the cons: super duper small rooms. Beds right up against the wall. No place to store your luggage. Sink in bathroom is at a weird angle because it is so small. Can't really relax in your room after a day of sightseeing unless you want to hop into bed. Forget about the ridiculous tiny closet they put into the room. The rooms actually do not have closets, but they bring in a tiny wardrobe.

They tell me they don't have any fridges in the rooms. I acknowledge this, but tell them I read on their website that although no fridges are in the rooms, one can be requested to be brought in for an additional fee. He tells me \"oh, we don't do that anymore\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and I tell him \"well, you should update your website then\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and he had no response. I asked what does the hotel do for breastfeeding mothers or those who require a refrigerator for medications. He says \"well, I don't think we could keep in the hotel fridges cuz that would be a health hazard.\" WTF??? I am glad I called before hand so I could make arrangements at another hotel.

So to expect an extravagantly sized hotel room in Manhattan - especially at an affordable price - is an extremely tall and rather unrealistic order. That being said, I stayed at the Doubletree Hotel Chelsea with a friend in February 2010. The exterior of the hotel is quite nice - modern and recently done up. The lobby is rather small though. They have 2 small elevators at the hotel - both of which seemed to run very slow. The small theme continues on in the rooms. We booked a hotel room for circa $150 for a Friday evening stay in NYC - very good deal. The hotel is well situated in Chelsea - within walking distance of many hot spots in midtown. What I didn't like was that the hotel is located on a block of 29th Street which is rather dimly lit at night. Other than that though, I felt safe staying in this hotel. As mentioned earlier, the size of the room was rather small though it was modern and well appointed. The room was CLEAN - which is most important. The bathroom was a reasonable size. We found it a plus that their bathrooms were stocked with Neutrogena items. The beds were comfortable for sleeping. The room came with a flat screen television. I would definitely stay here again.

Seriously. We were here with our young children and the room with two double beds was a joke -- literally two feet between the beds and 8 inches on either side of the beds. There is no closet (only a tiny wardrobe that you couldn't close the doors to once you put coats on the hangers), and no room for suitcases, much less a stroller or any other parcels. It was ridiculous. But it gets worse. This is a 27 story building with only two elevators that guests have to share with the cleaning service people. The usual wait on an upper 20s floor was at least 10 minutes in the morning. The maid on our floor complained to me that she had to wait 45 minutes to catch an elevator up to the top of the building to start her cleaning because there were so many guests waiting in the \"lobby\" (more on the \"lobby\" in a moment). When the elevator finally arrived, we literally stopped at every other floor on the way down. The elevator filled up after 3 stops, but it still stopped at nearly every floor and people who clearly wanted to leave (they had their roller bags with them) would have to wait for another elevator. The \"lobby\" was always freezing cold (late December) because the lobby is about the size of two of the rooms put together and the automatic doors were constantly opening and closing. It was the least welcoming lobby I've ever been in. And it was jammed with people waiting for the elevators. The restaurant with the \"free breakfast\" for Hilton Honors members was constantly running out of food and plates. Food was ok. The staff was very friendly. No complaint about them. They're doing the best they can in a ridiculous facility. The rooms were clean and new. And the price was ok for holiday season, but nothing great. But even if I paid half the price I paid (high $200s), it wouldn't be worth it. A decent hotel room can be a nice place to rest up after a day of touring the city ... but not in this hotel.

Nice hotel. Really matter of factly, there is nothing wrong with this hotel. The staff is friendly, it is clean, the rooms are fine (small, but fine), all is new, it's nice. Another thing that is very important, at least for my stay, what you get for the dollar is simply very very good. My nightly pre-paid rate on the Hilton site was around $200 a night. In NY, at this price, you can normally expect a dump. This is far from a dump! Also, before I continue, at this price, I'd probably stay here again. The price was this low because this DoubleTree is relatively new. They need to fill the rooms. However, assuming the price starts to move upward beyond the $250 range, in my opinion, this hotel starts to lose it's competitive edge. First off, let me say there are three key neighborhoods I like to stay in when I visit NY. One is Midtown, but specifically around 42nd St. around 5th Avenue; the second is around Union Square and the Flat Iron; and the third is Chelsea. Why? All of these areas offer great access to uptown and downtown cabs and subways depending on my need. Also, all have good bars and restaurants. Easy to get to and from. This hotel is in Upper Chelsea. For the money it's a good deal, but if the price goes up, the Hilton Garden Inn one block to the south is a much better option. First off, this hotel really does have SLOW elevators. It is 27 floors. Only two elvators are available. Ouch. On top of this, there is NO service elevator. Ouch. So you share with maid service and they stop on EVERY floor. There are also no mini-bars in the rooms. Most DoubleTree's have minibars, e.g. Full service. This is not a full service doubletree. Unlike the Hilton Garden Inn which has no Mini Bars, there is no Pantry and no Microwave or Fridge. So you are SOL if you need bottled water, etc. And yes, the rooms are small. The Lobby is REALLY tiny. Forget hanging out there for a long period of time. It's a stop and go place. The bar is also very small. The Hilton Garden Inn right behind this hotel has about the same size rooms, has a Pantry with food, has a fridge and a microwave. Also as a VIP Diamond, I am greeted at the Garden Inn with water. When I combine the lack of amenities with the slow elevators, small lobby, etc. price wise at the rate I paid, fine, I'll stay here. It is Nice as I said before. But, if the price goes up, the negatives are too great and I'd pick the Hilton Garden Inn over this hotel in a second. Mind you, if the price was not right and the Hilton Garden Inn was too expensive (which it does sell out) then I'd move to a different neighborhood. Just my 2 cents.

During the 3 night stay I heard 2 other people complaining about the same thing so its obviously an issue. The room (1006) was spotless and decently sized for a new york hotel room. The real issue is the lack of elevators. There are 2 for the entire hotel as well as the staff. The wait for the elevator was always a minute or 2, sometimes up to 5. If that doesn't sound long to you, you've never waited for an elevator that long. When it arrived it was inevitably packed and sometimes also had a maid or room service cart in there taking up 1/2 the space. I can't imagine what it would be like on an upper floor, probably a 15 minute commute from your front door to the entrance of the hotel including elevator wait and stopping at every floor.

At one point spent over five minutes waiting, while the one lift stayed on floor 12 the entire time!

Worse, the lack of hallway space on the guest floors means the housekeeping staff have to pile bags and bags of linens in the fire escape stairwells overnight, often blocking passage between floors. I used to live in NYC and have lived in high rises my entire adult life and can assure you this is a fire code violation. I showed pictures to the assistant manager who was very nice and apologetic and promised to bring it up at the next staff meeting. Still, it makes you wonder what else is going wrong. Other issues: no minibar, nor mini-refrigerator; no liquor license; ice machines on only every third or fourth floor (if you can get to them through the bags of linens). Now, the good part.
