The only reason I did not walk back out the door, get a refund, and find other accomodations is that I had worked late and was unable to check in until 10:30 pm. It would have been too late to go elsewhere. Really, this place is a dive - don't stay there. I chose it because I needed a room with a kitchen due to a special diet that required some cooking. Details of the scrunge: I had to get clean blankets from the desk. One of them looked like someone had walked all over it. I don't even want to think about when they last laundered the bed cover. The kitchen floor was so dirty my shoes stuck to it. The microwave had food \"explosions\" in it. The stove hood was greasy and dusty. The counters had not been wiped down. The sides of the toilet had something running down the sides. Don't want to think about that either. In addition, the interior is very rundown. Rusty towel racks, cabinets defacing, tub drains so slow you are ankle deep in water while showering. When I checked out, I saw a maid in another room \"cleaning\" the countertops with a broom. Well, that explains a lot. Other issues: I had my first foreboding feeling on my way to my room when I saw an eviction notice on the door of a unit below. Really? The unit next door had a dog that was left alone and barked all day. I never saw a person go to the room. There was dog dookie on the grass outside. Other Extended Stays: The night before, I had stayed at the Extended Stay in Woodland Hills, CA. It was only marginally better. I had hoped it was an exception and Homestead would be better, but it was worse. Homestead Suites Mission Valley appears to be not an extended stay hotel for business and leisure, but a very low rent apartment complex. You would probably do better at a seedy motel.

I believe the going rate during my stay was $60 a night for a room with two full beds and a kitchen. The room was big enough that my colleague and I didn't feel cramped; the kitchen and bathroom were functional and sanitary. The hotel has a few outdoor picnic tables (where you can get wi-fi) and a grill, which I saw people using while I was there. The Homestead is situated in an office park, so the immediate surroundings completely lack character but are very quiet (and totally abandoned at night). The hotel is a 5-10 minute walk (or a 2-3 minute drive) from a strip mall with a grocery store, pharmacy, Denny's, Starbucks, etc. It is also very convenient to a lot of other shopping centers and malls, as well as public transportation. Some reviewers mentioned that no one cleaned their room while they were there... It's the hotel's policy to clean each room only once a week during your stay, but you can request new towels/linens more frequently if you want them. (We did.) When I was there, they followed their policy and cleaned our room twice in two weeks. Some other reviewers mentioned traffic noise from the highway, and this might be a concern depending on your room. The hotel buildings are long, with one end very close to the highway and the other further away. I stayed roughly in the middle of my building and had no traffic noise at all in my room, so you would probably be okay as long as you request a room that's not right next to the highway. Overall, if you plan to treat your hotel room as a place to sleep and maybe cook meals, I recommend this hotel.

Also, the rooms are alittle dark; i suggest requesting a corner room as they have more windows. Overall the room was clean. There were a few blemishs on the bathroom floor but they would require more than a mop to remove (scuff marks, etc) so it didn't bother me as much. The AC worked well but the weather was nice & i felt safe enough to open the windows at night. Wireless internet was like $5......for my entire 3 night stay! You must stay at the hotel for a specific number of nights before they'll change your sheets for free but they do offer a paid service. In addition, you can go to the front desk & get new towels on a daily basis. The hotel staff was friendly & helpful. We booked a double room & at check-in they said these rooms are not available but they did supply us with two queen rooms next to each other as an alternative which worked for our sleeping arrangements. The front office closes so if you need something (toilet paper, towels, etc) I suggest getting it early. I stayed at the hotel with a large family group so we had good discounted rates & while it might not have thrilled anyone it satisified the needs of a wide group of people. There's a kitchen in the room so many within the group saved money by buying groceries at 1 of 2 stores near the hotel & cooked. There isn't a play area at the property so some kids might get alittle restless. There wasn't much traffic at the hotel so older kids may pass the time playing in the more remote parking areas (I'm certainly not condoning playing in the street :-)). If you plan on spending a large amount of time in the room I suggest staying at another hotel.

Pros: Location - near major shopping, walking distance to grocery store, starbucks, drug store. Only one mile from large malls, borders, target. Large closet Lots of storage room. Cons: The room is not clean - it seems they took great care in cutting costs wherever they could. This includes cleaning the rooms. The rooms are run down and are in desperate need of renovating. There were a few bugs in our room. The kitchen is small and not all that usable. The bathroom is spacious but was not cleaned well. The toilet works some of the time - runs most of the time. There are cigarette burns in the linens, blankets and curtains. There are stains on the sofa, carpets, tile floor. This location seems to be a place that new recruits for the military stay - which would be just fine, but the recruits tend to be up late, smoking and then up early in the morning doing PT IN the parking lot!

But I felt the room was small for business travelers compared to other suite hotels I've stayed at in the past. There isn't even a desk for a laptop, but they do offer wi-fi for free. We were there for a leisure weekend trip, and it was good enough because we only stayed in the room basically to sleep. There is a strip mall at the bottom of the hill includes a Starbucks, Ralph's and Long's drugs, so it's very convenient. There are 2 malls in the vicinity and Downtown San Diego is about 5-10 minutes away. The hotel is also right off of Hwy 63 and I-8, so we found it very convenient to where we had to go. It was also reasonably priced compared to the downtown hotels. We drove down to San Diego from the Bay area so we had a car to take us around. I didn't notice how public transportation is in the area, so that may be worth researching if you decide to stay there.", "Date": "June 30, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lacey, WA", "Title": "\u201cShabby Room for a High Price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2192392", "Content": "Stayed at the Mission Valley hotel over Memorial Day weekend.

The hotel staff was ok but not particulary helpful. It has every thing you would expect from Homestead but this is the most expensive Homestead we had ever stayed at - don't know if it is because of the time (around New Year's Day) or the location in San Diego.", "Date": "January 6, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Homestead Studio Suites San Diego / Mission Valley", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60750-d119755-Reviews-Homestead_Studio_Suites_San_Diego_Mission_Valley-San_Diego_California.html", "Price": "$78 - $98*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">7444 Mission Valley Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Diego</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">92108</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "119755", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/0c/20/0c20875e3805ba741bea4d366952d04e4large.jpg"}}
