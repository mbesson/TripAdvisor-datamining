I think.\u201d", "Author": "amber1027", "ReviewID": "UR123985960", "Content": "Ahh London. One of the worlds most beautiful & EXPENSIVE cities! Perhaps the best advice I can give is that you typically get what you pay for in this city. To get what would be your average no thrills hotel in most cities (aside from Tokyo) expect to pay about $200 plus per night. Keeping that and the exchange rate in perspective you can see why these hotels usually get such terrible ratings... that and the fact that they would probably be already have gone out of business in most other cities. Location wise its fantastic. I typically stay in the Victoria area and as my hotel experiences couldn't get much worse than there, I decided to give the Paddington area a try. Paddington Station is a 5-10min walk. Paddington Station is where the Heathrow express arrives (15min journey from Heathrow to Paddington Station for about twenty pounds one way) and the regular Heathrow Train (25min journey for about 9 pounds one way). The walk to the hotel is very simple if you take down directions or a cab fare would probably be about 5 pounds, maybe less. All tube stations seem to be a 5-10 min walk (Paddington or Queensway) and Kennsington Park is a 5 min walk or less. The hotel receptionists were friendly enough and check in was fine. The hotel does provide free and reasonable safe locked luggage storage in a cupboard adjacent to the front desk. You can purchase internet for an hour or a day at the front desk. Think it was around 8-10 pounds for 24hrs. The ensuite room was located in the basement (as most cheaper expedia bookings seem to be) and is a typical tiny London room. The room comes complete with a wardrobe, desk and chair, tv with a few channels (the typical tv remote that apparently works for a tv in some other in the building but not the one in your room) double or twin beds, night stand and barely room to move. The room did come with a small safe and seemed reasonably clean. Bewarned the walls are thin in this hotel! You will hear your neighbors if you have any and they will hear you. On my first morning there I had the pleasure of bring woken up at 530am by a drunken lady screaming into her phone to her mother about helping the children of Egypt after what apparently was a great night out on the town. How do I know all this about a phone conversation having nothing to do with me you ask? As I said the walls are very VERY thin apparently. I am not sure who was more relived when her credit ran out... her mother or myself. I am still not sure if this woman was screaming outside the bedroom door, in the room next door or if she had somehow snuck into my room and was standing with a megaphone at the bottom of my bed. But you get the point. If this woman isn't still around for your 530am wake up call, never fear the many children in the hotel will be up screaming and tearing around the place slamming doors by about 730am. And if this still doesn't rose you out of bed the silent knocking maid with the ability to open a door faster than the speed of light will surely have you up by 10am latest. And yes she did this both days. I was beginning to question if she has a side job with Inquirer to try to get surprise photos. The ensuite bathroom was better than most I have seen in London, even despite the cracked tiles in one area. It apparently had been recently renovated and is refreshingly clean. Plenty of warm water and water pressure. This is not something I am used to in London. Typically I feel like I am attempting a shower out of a frozen garden watering can. So that was a pleasant surprise. Also the shower drain actually drained. Another first in a cheap London hotel for me. Often I emerge from the shower to make my way across a swamp only to find it flooding into my bedroom as well. Do be sure to keep their towels tidy as the sign says or they will happily charge you a 10 pound fee. After the cracked tiles on the floor stained the bathmat towel I had a note awaiting me in my room informing me of a 10 pound charge for replacement. Upon showing the desk clerk that their floor tile was cracked and that is where the stain came from (and that I don't infact wear industrial strength rust on my face as makeup) the charge was dropped. It is a bit comical that they would charge 10 pounds for their towels as even in their brand new towel days I doubt they ever saw 10 pounds. I never tried the hotel breakfast but there is a great little cafe down the same street heading towards Kennsington Park that had a great 4.99 pound traditional English breakfast and other delicious choices as well. So overall location is great, the hotel is better than many I have experienced in Victoria area and just keep in mind you get what you pay for in London and many of the buildings in this city are quite old and cramped which is part of what makes it such a great place and makes finding a descent affordable room so challenging.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gothenburg, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cFamily from Sweden\u201d", "Author": "Sweden33", "ReviewID": "UR123824568", "Content": "This was the Third time we visit London in a year, and gave this Hotel a second chance in oct 2011, as we wasnt so happy after the first time a year earlier.

The kids got a drafty room, from the window, and we, the parents, where every morning woken by the kitchen staff one floor down.

In october 2011, we tried again, = BAD idea. The New Mercedes that the Hotel then showed on the homepage as their new Taxi, was instead a old Volkswagen with old papers on the floor, and you guessed right, again we had to wait for it for one hour on Heathrow airport. Got another small room then the one we had before, lucky us :-( , and the bed placed in a room suited for a single bed, was in the form of an old hammock so the back wasnt any happy after the nights. Asked the manager of a refund of the Taxifair, because of the waitingtime that could have taken us in to the hotel by the tube and a lot cheaper, and because of the bad advertising on the class of transport.

The Receptionist clearly wasn't happy with this, but we weren't prepared to stay in a cold, damp room in the basement. On the subject of the Receptionist, the words \"please\" and \"thank you\" weren't in her vocabulary and she wasn't at all welcoming.

The next morning, still no hot water, so we rang Reception again and were told to let the shower run for at least 10 minutes before it gets warm. Yes guys and girls - this is the 21st century but it still takes 10 minutes to get hot water to the 2nd floor in this place. The room had a hairdryer, so I didn't bother taking one with me.

The serving dish containing the cereal I wanted was empty, so I asked for some more but was told they'd run out. Okay, I guess breakfast was a bonus, but I still expected better.

Having booked a double room, I got a huge (for London) 4-berth room (double and two single beds). The room was spotless, the linen clean and fresh and enough little touches (recessed spotlights/pictures and mirrors/a small fridge/tea & coffee facilites) to make it feel like a higher star rated room. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in and although the bathroom was small (1metre by 3metres), it was also spotless, nicely tiled and the shower was hot and powerful. Not only that - the television has a decent selection of channels and a remote control that actually worked. A miracle. Breakfast was included in the knockdown price - basic but the toast was freshly made on arrival, and the staff were friendly and helpful.

However, the wall had a MASSIVE, and I'm talking MASSIVE, amount of water damage on the wall. Laughably, they had a crooked painting trying to cover the large hole in the wall but the damage went from the middle of the wall to the roof. By this time we were too tired to complain so we just went to bed, but a small child cried from 3am til 9am when we went for breakfast (admittedly not the hotel's fault but annoying nonetheless). Breakfast was pretty standard, toast, cereals, juice and perfect for the budget traveller looking to get some grub in before they start their day. After breakfast we asked to have our room changed because of the water damage and annoying kid and they gave yet another room. Open the door, and BAM, 4 single beds. Why 4 singles for a couple? Asked for a double bed room as we'd asked for when we booked and were told one wasn't available til 1pm so we went off for the day.

I had already stayed at this hotel twice before, so i knew what to expect. The hotel is minutes away from Bayswater and Queensway tube (although i always use Bayswater tube - its much quicker to exit!). I arrived at the hotel, and was checked in quickly by the receptionist - as ive mentioned ive been here before and i remembered this receptionist is the rude one - always looking unhappy and depressed!! I made my way up to my room, it was the second time i had the same room and was very pleased about it. The room is very clean, good bed, decent sized tv, 6 tv channels, and plenty of space compared to other London hotels. The room was very warm, and I had a good view overlooking the Queensway area. The bathroom is very clean - and a good size. The shower was always warm, and I had no problems. The hotel is near a mini Tesco, Mcdonalds, Burger King and small independant shops. (They are on the Queensway high street - all opposite Baywater tube) I went downstairs at 11am to get some more tea bags, and was greeted by the friendly bloke at reception. He spoke to me for 10 minutes, and seemed very good at his job. I went out about an hour later, and again the receptionist was very friendly. I woke up at 5.30am, and went for a run in the local area - i love that part off london in early morning - see all the workers going about their normal day. The hotel is very near to Paddington Train station, and not too far from Oxford Street. About an hour later, i arrived back to a nice warm hotel. The hotel is very quiet - almost no traffic noise, and i never hear guests going past the room. The downside about the hotel is the breakfast - its terrible!! I recieved an egg, one slice off toast, and a cold cup of tea! It was the first time i tried breakfast at this hotel - i thought the decor off the room was poor as well. My tip is go to Mcdonalds for a egg mcmuffin - it opens at 6am and is only \u00c2\u00a31. Or Tesco do decent sandwiches, or get a Cereal bowl from 50p with cereal and milk included! I paid \u00c2\u00a335 for my en-suite room, a bargain!! It said in the reception normal room rates are \u00c2\u00a370, the most ive ever paid here is \u00c2\u00a340 a night, and I would not pay over that here.

There is a storeroom but the staff behind the reception couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the key! Well, they really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother looking. They suggested we put our luggage by the reception unsupervised. When we declined they made a sneer at us. Just imagine you have to catch a flight and the damn key is nowhere to be found! To be on the safe side we stored our luggage in Waterloo Station. My conclusion: unfortunately the negative outweighs the positive. I will not be staying here again. Also, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend it to others.", "Date": "July 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "oregon", "Title": "\u201cOn a scale of one to ten, it's a five\u201d", "Author": "lostinthe", "ReviewID": "UR8056605", "Content": "Because this hotel was recently rennovated, everything may look good at first.

I had booked a family room 2 months before our arrival and expected a nice room. We, a family with two teenagers, were given room #7 which was on ground floor. Already in the hallway we felt an unpleasant smell and it didn't get more pleasant when we realised that it came from our room. When we entered I stepped on something \"splashy\" - that was our carpet. It was soaking wet from the water that came running down directly from the bathroom above. The ceiling was cracking, the wallpaper was coming down and the stench of mould was revolting. I went right back to the reception where a gum-chewing girl said that they were fully booked and that she could do nothing at the moment. As it was almost midnight and we were all really tired we opened the window (in mid-November) and tried to sleep in that hell-hole anyway. By 6am I was nearly suffocating and I ran out to the reception in my nightwear and demanded another room immediately or else I would have to go to hospital for my asthma. She turned pale and assured me we get another room in the afternoon. When we came back in the afternoon we were given another room which was OK, but my not wanting to pay for the first night was neglected (I had paid everything in advance, stupid) and they even had the nerve to tell me I should be grateful that they gave us another room. Well back home I sent an e-mail to the Hotel Manager, to Travelocity and to the UK Tourist Board. Nobody ever answered or even acknowledged my mail.

We were treated very well, a taxi was ordered and paid for and we were dropped at the apartment. The bedsit/tiny flat was on the 3rd floor and there was no lift, so it was a bit of a trek with suitcases. The flat itself was disgusting, it was filthy, the bed covers were dirty, but someone had kindly sprayed them with deodorant to make them smell ok. The kitchenette smelt of sick and this was probably coming from the fridge, which was leaking, and had a dirty towel shoved in the base of it to stop the icebox melting. Every upholstered surface was covered in fluff and long white hairs, the shower room was dirty and the shower itself had brown water in the base unit. Additionally there were no fire or emergency evacuation instructions, I'm not a risk freak, but in an enormous block of flats such as this one, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s always nice to know how to get out! The flat itself was in a square just off Queensway, unfortunately it looks as if this square is on the wrong side of the tracks as on every doorstep, there were drunks or people waiting to collect a fix. I wouldn't have felt safe walking back to the flat on my own; luckily I had a big strong man with me! We had to stay one night in this flat, but I complained the next morning and while the manager on duty was fairly nonchalant and didn't offer an apology they did put us in a room in the hotel - room 405. The hotel seems to have a similar standard of cleanliness to the flat, walls need a paint, rooms smell musty, but the sheets were clean and after very little sleep the night before that was a blessing. However the next morning I woke and after deciding not to shower in the flat was desperate for a wash, I opened the shower room door and was greeted by a huge cockroach. My partner who is an entomologist (so no chance of misidentifying it) caught it and I took it to reception as we checked out. The man on the desk looked at it laughed loudly and threw it in the bin, no apology was offered. I've travelled all over the world and I'm not a lily-livered traveller, but this has got to be one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. Yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fairly cheap, but there are other places to go, this is disgusting.

In March 2007 I had to go two nights to London to attend a meeting and an interview. I wanted a cheap but good standard hotel where I could get some work done in the evening, where I could sleep properly to have enough energy for the work I had to do, and where I could fresh up in the morning without having to find ants or nasty stains in the bathroom. This may sound like basics, but there are some real dumps among the budget hotels in London. I booked Leisure Inn mostly based on the reviews here and the reasonable rates they offered, and I was positively surprised. The hotel was a 10-minute walk from Paddington station where you have access to four underground lines and the Heathrow Express going directly to Heathrow aiport (only 15 mins). Safe area with a few restaurants and corner shops within walking distance from the hotel. My room was small but adequate located on the fourth floor, it was very quiet and I was never bothered by the traffic or neighbouring guests. The bed was supposed to be a double bed, but honestly it was just slightly wider than my regular bed at home and the room must surely be on the smaller side if you are two people travelling together, the bed was very comfortable though. There was also a small desk with tea and coffee-making facilities, toilet and shower (in excellent condition), and a TV. I could only access three channels through the TV which was a disappointment, but I never complained about it. The breakfast was very simple with only toast, marmalade, cornflakes and milk, coffee/tea and orange juice. Something more would have been nice, at least some cold cuts. Staff on the whole friendly and courteous with the exception of one receptionist who was a bit surly The girl who checked me in was very pleasant, she recognised me throughout the stay and greeted me every time I passed the reception. Overall the hotel was everything I was looking for: cheap, safe, quiet, reasonable room standard and friendly staff.

I stayed by myself. It's in a great location (near Paddington and Hyde Park) and in a pretty pleasant area (lots of other hotels) away from busy roads. Was slightly unnerved by the need to leave a \u00c2\u00a330 cash deposit on check-in (in case of damages / thefts) and half expected to come back to the room to find the towels had \"disappeared\" and would lose the deposit Thankfully that was just my paranoia and I got the deposit back without any problem. The room (number 15) was in the basement but had a window. A good triple room. Furnished a bit like a travel lodge, i.e. modern and functional; no frills but clean. Nice bathroom. Comfy beds. Generally in a good state of repair. Lots of lighting options (spotlights / side lights). Very satisified! The only downside was the bedroom door was pretty thin / not well soundproofed so I was repeatedly woken from 6am by slamming doors from early risers / cleaning staff. I'm quite a heavy sleeper, so it was surprising. I dropped straight back off each time though. Breakfast was basic but fine (choice of cereals, followed by toast with cheese and jam selections. self service tea/coffee/juice.). Staff could be friendlier, but I was just on a weekend getaway (kicked out of the house whilst my fiance tried on wedding dresses with her bridesmaid) and I just needed a place to crash so didn't really care. The advertised room rate for the triple I had was \u00c2\u00a3138, but I only paid \u00c2\u00a376 at lastminute *including* the theatre ticket. I think my review might be less favourable if I'd paid full price. It's a perfectly fine hotel, but not for \u00c2\u00a3138 a night. Overall, no complaints.

We chose this hotel because it was cheap (37 pounds per night ensuite double room) and because of the reviews it got on this website. The room was OK. There was an awfull smell (like feet?) though when we came in. The TV had 5 channels, 4 of which were very blurred. The street is not too busy with cars, but it isn't too silent either. The rooms being equipped with single-glazing windows, there was still quite some noise most of the time, especially early in the mornings. I think it might get quite annoying in the summer when you want to keep your windows open. A real drawback was the fact that the shower would not work at peak-times. This is not a temporary problem, but due to the lack of water pressure. (We were on the 3rd floor. It might perhaps be different on the lower floors.) There will be no hot water available as long as other guests are having a shower and even late at night or in the afternoon it takes quite a while to get wet with a shower as week as this. Be warned: you should not take a shower when you are in a hurry because the hot water might turn off completely at times when other guests turn theirs on. And this could well be when you are all soaped up and ready to rinse. Breakfast: you get what you pay for - and that is not very much. The \"buffet\" has only got two kinds of cereals, milk, tiny cups for coffee or tea and one kind of (rather dry) sliced cheese. Orange juice is available, but there are not as many glasses as there are guests. The same is true for the space: you should be prepared to wait for a seat in the breakfast room. We were given 3 slices of toast (that's one and a half per person) and two or sometimes three tiny packs of jam and butter. We didn't ask for more because the staff was not very friendly at all. Having asked for a glass I felt like I was not really welcome at this hotel. One more thing: the hotel charged the first night before we even got there and the other two nights were to be paid for upon arrival before we even had a chance to see (or smell) our room. If we get to book this hotel for under 40 pounds per night again, we might return.
