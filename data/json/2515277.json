It's always professional, the staff have always been courteous, the food has always been good and it's a good business hotel. I've never had any major gripes about it, which says something, as I tend to be a bit of Victor Meldrew when travelling. This hotel is like a comfortable pair of chic slippers, or how I imagine a pair would be, my own are actually a long way away from chic. I always look forward to staying here as I know my stay will be comfortable, I won't be disturbed by neighbours/room temp/rubbish food/uncomfortable beds etc. Essentially it's a great place to stay and get some work done if required or just chill out. it is pretty business focussed so I'm not sure I'd stay if I were paying, preferring something with a bit more character, but as a business hotel it hits the spot. I have only 2 points where they could improve, and what review would be complete without these. Ok, firstly, it's DARK....dark in reception, dining room, bar, dark in the lift, dark in the hall, and yup, pretty dark in the rooms. I am as eco friendly as the next person, but I do get a little tetchy when I have all the lights on and I still have to echolocate to find my way around. My second point is almost trivial, however, the few times I have mustered the energy to go to the gym, it is in a pretty sorry state. (the gym, not me/my workout). It's a tiny little room with a running machine, rowing machine and cycling machine. I think they got rid of the rubbish nautilus machine. Anyway, last time I went I set the running machine to max in an effort to try out a new Tabata training routine (brilliant, look it up) and while I was sprinting at my sweating max the (cheap) running machine seized up, with *hilarious* consequences. Luckily it was first thing in the morning and no one noticed me extricating my face from the digital display. However, apart from these two relatively minor issues I am more than pleased to stay at this hotel when on business.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood - great service\u201d", "Author": "jennerm", "ReviewID": "UR127092205", "Content": "Good hotel - nice rooms, modern, not too noisy, GREAT staff, esp Erica", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zagreb, Croatia", "Title": "\u201cStandard Radisson experience.\u201d", "Author": "Absolute_Traveller_X", "ReviewID": "UR125240703", "Content": "Two nights stay in this very good hotel I would recommend to everyone staying in Paris.

The room was warm and spacious for the three of us, bed was comfy with massive fluffy pillows on top. We loved the hotel bar room downstairs - quiet and relaxing, perfect to sit with your friends for food or drinks. Food was awesome, bar staff were lovely and tried their best to understand us when we spoke in English. Another thing to point out was that we forgot to bring an umbrella over to Paris in this snowy/rainy weather so it was a nice that the hotel had extra ones near the reception entrance for us to borrow which was perfect.. kept us all dry throughout of holiday ^^!! The metro station (Porte De St Cloud) was about 5mins walk away which was convienant and there where shops/restarant in walking distance from the hotel.

Lastly we paid staff rates while we where staying there so definately worth the money and stay THUMBS UP! The negatives =( - I was a little disappointed with the breakfast buffet, i thought there would be a bigger and wider selection of food as it was a \"buffet\". Another issue was that one of the housekeeping staff where abit rude, on the first night, we requested a few things up to the room and she looked annoyed as you took the items up for us. And she was rudely chewing her gum, didnt even say hello or bye when she walks in/out.

Good restaurants are A & M, Cardinal and Cafe Caves all well worth a visit and guess what no tourists. A good location to get to Versailles and so easy even by bus to the Arc De Triumph and Galleries Laffayette. A good tip when travelling from London by Eurostar is to buy the Metro tickets at St Pancras (for 3 days I bought a carnet and 2 2day tickets for 2 persons for GBP40.00 which gave excellant value and the add on to Versailles was GBP6.00 purchased locally)..

At first I was disappointed that we were not staying close to all the tourist attractions or closer into the old city.

The neighborhood is residential, very close to the Porte de Saint Cloud (traffic circle with a lot of shops and restaurants). You can also walk from the hotel to the circle where there is both Metro and bus service...very short walk. There is a nice but expensive restaurant in the hotel, where they served a very nice breakfast buffet, plated lunches and dinners, and had a nice trendy (but small) bar. Drawback: all the food and drinks were expensive - 9 euro for a cocktail, 25 euro for breakfast. The rooms were very nice and, though kind of small by American standards, were equipped with a large picture window overlooking the street and city, large flat screen tv with lots of channels (mostly French but some in English), very nice bath with tub/shower combo, nice towels, etc., and a desk/sitting area. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly and not the stereotypical \"rude\" French at all. In fact, during my whole trip I never encountered one rude person (except for Americans). There was wireless internet in the hotel and in our room but I found it difficult to get a consistent signal on my laptop. The concierge at the desk was helpful in making recommendations on where to walk for dinner...the entire staff spoke excellent English and was extremely helpful and friendly.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have American-style hotel amenities but doesn't want to pay the higher price for a hotel closer in to the city. One more tip: we rode the Metro one time from the neighborhood into the city...after that, we took a tour book piece of advice and rode the buses. They are clean, cheap, and a great way to get on and off where you like when you see something interesting. You also get to see a lot of the city when riding, versus being underground all the time in the Metro.

Other information: The travel adapter we brought was wrong, so don't worry, you can rent one there for 5 EUR, which you can get back at the end of your stay. There is also free broadband internet access there for business customers. The safe was also very high tech and safe too. There is free coffee and tea in the mini bar which we managed to finish on the second night! The restaurant looked interesting too, but the price list wasn't too impressive. There are so many restaurants just opposite the road of the hotel, which was more filling than anything! Paris: Overall, travel was by far more convenient than London. The french must hate walking, since the stops are so close to each other. But BEWARE, the tube map is so complexed! Porte de St Cloud is the nearest station to the hotel, and getting to places like the Tour Eiffel, Galeries Lafayette was easy and fairly quick... in fact everywhere was pretty convenient as the stops went really quickly. If in doubt, just take a taxi because they are also quite cheap! People in paris don't really speak english. Well, they do, but they are too lazy to talk to you in english, they like to prefer to answer to you in french. Especially in restaurants. It was fairly cold when we went to Paris, but we very much enjoyed our stay and the atmosphere there. We also went to disneyland on the last day also which was really fun! I really recommend this hotel for anyone who is planning on visiting Paris, as you will find it will really add comfort to your stay. There are other branches of this hotel, I believe one in centre of Paris too. I hope this review has helped you into finding a hotel for your stay, please feel free to email me for any other questions you may have!

Concierge and desk staff definitely showed effort in trying to be helpful. They were able to provide a room even though I was checking in fairly early in the morning. The concierge staff was able to direct me on foot to a couple of nearby locations. Getting a taxi was painful however, especially around 8 AM, so if possible, leave earlier or use another mode of transportation. The metro and buses are a very short walk away, and only a few stops from the center of Paris (took about 30 minutes to get to Musee d'Orsay for example). Had one dinner at the restaurant, and the food was adequate. I found the service to be friendly and they made an excellent wine recommendation.

Given the memory of this, I had been a little reluctant to book a stay here. Based on a 3-day stay, this appears now to have greatly changed. Staff were friendly and very accommodating (especially by Paris standards), both at reception and in the bar/restaurant areas. Restaurant food is traditional French fare, and very, very good, if somewhat costly, although the staff seemed unable to advise on the wine list (may have just been that particular night).

On the first day we walked from our hotel along the river to the Eiffel Tower and that helped with our orientation and didn't take too long. We had a good room on the 8th floor (top?) and had everything we could need in a hotel room, as previous reviewers have noted. The staff were extremely helpful and charming to deal with. We left our luggage at both ends of our stay and enjoyed a coffee in the bar as we waited to check in and when waiting to go back to the airport.

Staff/concierge were very helpful, although I think they gave us wrong information a few times (telling us that we couldn't just \"show up\" at a local restaurant, the concierge had to call and when we got there the place was empty; told my husband there was only one dinner cruise company when there are actually several, etc.). I think they must have an agreement with those places and get some kind of commission for referrals, which is fine - just be honest about it! Another poster mentioned a local restaurant, Chez Michel - it is actually only one block away, on the street that comes out directly in front of the hotel. It was a nice little place and the food was excellent, one of the best meals we had in Paris all week! It was a fairly easy day trip to Versailles from here - about 45 minutes total (short Metro plus an easy-to-catch bus). The hotel bar was hip and comfortable and the food in the restaurant very good.

I have stayed in a couple of Radissons hotels and I must say that this was by far the best in terms of friendly service and the welcoming atmosphere the staff in this hotel give. The room was clean, tidy and very well presented, and the little touches made the difference, like chocolates on the bedside table and a welcome note from the manager. Buffet breakfast was included in my reservation and the choice on offer was wide and varied, even to the point of instead of little individual plastic pots of honey, to having a honeycomb section from a bee hive hanging over a bowl. You can't really get fresher honey than that. The bacon/sausages and hot items weren't of a really high standard but the continental side of the buffet more than made up for that. Fresh pastries and breads, plus a good selection of fruits, yogurts and cold meats and cheeses. Yes the hotel isn't situation directly central in Paris but there is a bus stop and a metro stop just over the motorway bridge at the end of the road, giving you quick access to Line 9 for the metro which takes around 25 mins to get you in to the centre of Paris or 10 mins to the Eiffel Tower.
