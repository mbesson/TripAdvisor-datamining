I also asked the Dr. office to request the room for the next surgery. Then I had a friend come in- in person to confirm the room. Then I called the night before my arrival to reconfirm the room and the rate because I wanted to have food delivered.

I would never expect this from a Holiday inn. I made a reservation and paid in advance and checked into the Vancouver Canada hotel on Sunday afternoon. On May 8th. I picked this Hotel because it stated it had an indoor swimming pool. When I arrived in Canada and checked into the Hotel the front desk employee told me that the Pool was closed due to renovations. Me and my friend were very disappointed because we looked forward to using the pool. She did not really care and told us that we should have seen it was under renovation when we booked the hotel. No where did it say that you were under renovation. If I had known this I would have booked for another Holiday inn. I was very tired traveling and just got off a ship and I am not from Canada, do not know the area so we had no car and no choice but to stay at this hotel. Not to mention I had already paid for this hotel in advance. I want to let you know that the hammering started early in the am and I could not sleep in. when my friend took a shower I got in the shower about 15 minutes later and there was very little hot water. I had two minutes of hot water for myself. I would think that the hot water heater in a Holiday Inn would be able to accomodate two people. There was also only one elevator because the other one was closed down and on more than one occasion I had to wait 7 minutes for the elevator to open. Also when I was checking out I called the front desk to complain again about the elevator and told them I was trying to check out and it was 5 minutes til 12 and the elevator was not opening. I had a plane to catch and they never offered to come up and carry my luggage after I asked them where the stairs were located. Also cockroaches near the window. I complained to Holiday inn when I got home and all they did was send an e mail back to me thinking me for my \"COMMENT\" i Will never stay at ANY holiday inn AGAIN", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monterey, California", "Title": "\u201cWarning: Hotel under-construction toxic fumes\u201d", "Author": "algernonj", "ReviewID": "UR111491714", "Content": "Stay away.

It is a good hotel for the price. If you just want somewhere to lay your head at night and get a shower then its fine. The decor is a little out dated, but it was clean over all. The staff are nice and helpful. There is a taxi stand right outside the hotel and there is always atleast one waiting. We didnt eat at the hotel resturant, we went to an italian place about a block east of the hotel on Broadway called Favouritos based on a recommendation from the front desk (It was amazing! pretty resonable prices as well) and we ate breakfast at the Denny's about 6 blocks to the west of the hotel on Broadway. There are computers in the lobby area where you pay 3 dollars for 15 minutes of access and you can make an account to save any unused time for use up to 60 days later. The pool was clean, and pretty nice for the hotel. The weight room was good as well. There is no Casino in the basement, there hasnt been for about 4 months. Overall it was a pleasant stay. The Hotel is in sort of a noisy area, alot of traffic goes by, the street crossing signs beep, and a few ambulances go by every once and a while. But it just sort of blends into the backround. There are a few homeless people around, but they just ask you for change, nothing else. They dont want anything to do with you really. So, yeah it was good stay, ok hotel for the price.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nagoya", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel at a great price\u201d", "Author": "MintSliceFan", "ReviewID": "UR12452706", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and overall we enjoyed ourselves. The check-in was fast and polite and we got a complimentry upgrade to an excecutive suite with a king sized bed and balcony. The room was very comfortable and the bed awesome. I have never slept in something so soft and comfortable. The bathroom was okay, we found the water pressure to be very average but the shower did have a mult-function shower head. The room service was fast, efficient and the quality of the food was excellent. It was reasonably priced as well. We had breakfast via room service costing $30 for two people. The hotel has a resturant downstairs, next to the lobby but DON'T try it - we had a \"hot\" breakfast there on our first morning and it was cold and very unappealing. Reading some of the reviews on this website, it seems that other guests have had a similar experience. When I checked out, I mentioned to the staff about the poor resturant breakfast and they were very good about it, reimbursing me for it. The hotel is about 30 minutes walk from downtown vancouver but i felt it was a safer place than the city. There is a London Drugstore a street away, as well as a starbucks and several enthic resturants nearby. I would recommend this hotel for a short stay, especially for a business trip and sightseeing.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cDisappointed with this hotel.\u201d", "Author": "KSRNewJersey", "ReviewID": "UR8548252", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel Aug 4-8 and was definitely not up to the standards normally found with Holiday Inns in the US. One of the only 2 elevators for the hotel broke the day after we got there and still was not fixed when we left. The sink in the bathroom was clogged and leaked underneath. The bathtub clogged every time you took a shower and the smoke detector also went off when you took a shower. They fixed the sink and we were told that \"this happens\" with the problem with the smoke detector. Front desk was not very friendly. Complimentary shuttle service to the airport was booked as full every day, at which time we were told that most likely the driver was on vacation. The Stages restaurant adjacent to the hotel was marginal. The hot breakfast was inedible. Paid $174 per night through Liberty Travel.

Hotel is an older property, but room was nicely updated and very, very clean. Room faced east and slightly north with a good view of the east end of downtown (Yaletown), the Expo ball, and the mountains beyond. Room had a balcony looking south and down onto Broadway.

While it will never rival the big, fancy EXPENSIVE hotels in the city's \"core\" for amenities, it did the trick just fine. It is clean and decently appointed--a three-star hotel in every sense. The hotel staff were very accomodating and pleasant. We arrived a couple of hours before check-in and our room wasn't ready; however, they got it done within 15 minutes.
