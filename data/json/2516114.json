Upon checking in the staff was great and very helpful. We stayed for three nights and on our second night there was a bit of an issue. Maybe the walls are thin, or our neighbors were extremely loud! But we were traveling with our two children and the sounds from the neighbors room were not something that they should be hearing. My wife complained about it to Quianna at the front desk in the morning. She was extremely helpful and said she would give us a free upgrade to their other building as soon as there was a room available. We were expecting a regular room but were actually upgraded to a large suite because of the unfortunate issue the night before. This actually worked out great for us, and our last night there couldn't have been better. The continental breakfast was actually pretty good also, and we made good use of the free wifi. If I'm ever back in the area I will be staying here again just because of the warm customer service we received by the front desk when we arrived with our issue.

The wedding was set to take place at noon of sunday, may 22nd. At about 10am on the morning of the wedding we went down to get something out of our car, to our alarm the car was nowhere to be found. We rushed to the front desk to ask if they know anything about our car being gone. The receptionist explained that the due to construction in the parking lot, our car has been towed and suggested we call the towing company. When we asked why is it our responsibility to contact the towers and retrieve the car instead of hers, she replied \" well because it's not my car...\". This very rude response offended us deeply. We next asked to see the manager. The manager on duty was Mr. Ben [--]. When we explained the situation to him he responded in basically the same manner as the receptionist, apologizing but maintaining that his hands are tied and it is solely OUR problem. We then inquired for the reason we were not informed in any way about the construction nor of the possibility of our car being towed should we park in the hotel parking lot that morning, to this he replied by saying that there were signs saying it hung in the parking lot, and that they have told the guests in person that they should not park there. Needless to say there were no signs in the parking lot, just in the lobby, into which you have no real reason of entering at any time during your stay. The second part was just a blatant lie, as WE were not told in any point in our stay about any of this. Frustrated, we asked him to try and think of solutions, since we had to attend the wedding at noon and were in great need of a transportation. He offered to order a taxi. When we asked who would pay for that taxi he responded that, you guessed it, it is our responsibility. At this point we asked what would be the cost of freeing our car to which he replied \"around a hundred dollars\". We insisted that we should not pay neither for a taxi nor for the releasing our car from the towing lot and that we see it as his responsibility to take care of the inconvenience caused to us and to compensate us in full. He replied that he is not authorized to compensate us for any amount larger than 20 US dollars, and that he needs to speak to his manager Mrs Marichu [--]. We asked him to contact her and get the permit to compensate us. He called her cell phone, but she did not pick up. We demanded to get some sort of response, especially since we were pressed in time. He promised he'd get back to us in ten minutes. We went back to our room and waited for 15 minutes to no avail.After this we went back to the front desk to ask if there were any news, he said he still could not reach Mrs [--] and asked us to wait in our room and that he would call us when he reaches the manager on the phone. We waited for 15 more minutes until he called the room and told us the manager was nowhere to be found. Also, he apologized for giving us the wrong number before. Turns out the price of getting our car would be \"more like three hundred dollars\". Meaning, the hotel to which we are paying customers, fined us a sum greater then the charge for our entire stay. Finally we realized that if we do not retrieve the car by ourselves as soon as possible we would miss the wedding completely. The towing company employees were in the hotel parking lot again towing other paying costumers cars, and they agreed to give as a ride to the towing lot. When I asked the manager why they keep towing cars instead of calling the people who's cars are being towed he again lied and said he tried calling but they didn't pick up. We retrieved the car, payed 293.70$ and drove to the wedding, an hour late. Again, this wedding was the sole reason to our visit. Upon arriving back to the hotel later that evening, a different receptionist told us he was aware of the incident that happened earlier that morning, but that he too had his hands tied. He advised us to wait until the following morning to speak to Mrs [--] in person since she could not be reached during the whole day. We would have appreciated the opportunity to finally speak to her. Unfortunately, she was said to arrive at 9am while we had to leave at 8:30am to our flight back to New York. We mentioned to the receptionist that it is quite odd for a manager to not answer her phone for an entire day. He agreed with us and yet again apologized but left us with no real response. We were appalled by the horrible service, rude responses, and the act of towing a guests car without even trying to contact him in any way. It is important to note that the hotel had both our car and personal information the entire duration of our stay, thus able to contact us via our cells or the room phone, prior to ordering the towing company to take our car.", "Date": "May 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cOk, I am really impressed.\u201d", "Author": "Baronent", "ReviewID": "UR107153385", "Content": "This property is listed as a 2 star.
