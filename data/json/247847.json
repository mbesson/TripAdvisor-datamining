Located on US1/Truman Avenue, it is a high traffic area, but as long as your room is not facing the street, this is not a big deal. Like many converted hotels, the rooms at Chelsea House vary in size, location, amenities, etc. more than a purpose-built hotel. Therefore, any reviews you read may be colored by where in the hotel people stayed. This was our first stay at Chelsea House and we were there during the slowest month of the year (September). We had reserved a queen bed room, but were upgraded to a king room because of the relatively low occupancy. We were there for 5 nights. Three buildings make up Chelsea House; two \"houses\" with rooms on multiple levels and a third building that we have not figured out what it's orignal purpose was. Our room (number 31 aka \"The Conch Suite\") was in this third building. It is located between the two main parking areas. There are four rooms in this building (two on each floor) with the outside facing Elizabeth Avenue. Our room was the first floor inside room facing toward the pool side. The suite consisted of two rooms separated by a partial wall. You open the door to a small sitting area with TV, two chairs, and a table. There is also a min-fridge. The bathroom was tiny with a small shower, pedestal sink, and toilet contained in a 5'x6' space. Yep, it was THAT small. The bedroom held a king bed, small dresser, large closet, and secretary. There is a safe in the closet. We also had a porch with two chairs and a table. Everything in the room was functional and the bed was comfortable. Overall, the room needs updating, but it was serviceable. Cooling was provided by a wall mounted A/C that ran 24 hours a day. It kept the room quite comfortable and provided white noise. The bathroom was clean but there were several broken tiles and it could use some maintenance. There is apparently one water heater servicing all four rooms in the building, so showering was an adventure in highs and lows (temperatures, that is). The sink is small and there is nowhere to put a toiletry bag or even your toothbrush. The biggest complaint we had was that the small flat screen TV is located in the sitting area facing the two chairs and it is not visible from the bedroom. We weren't there to watch TV, so it wasn't a big deal, but we are used to being able to watch the news or weather when we get up. The people were helpful and friendly as were the two resident cats. The pool is small and shallow, but is PERFECT for relaxing. The \"garden\" that surrounds the pool offers shade for at least part of the area for most of the day. It was 10-15 degrees cooler around the pool than in the sun. Breakfast is typical continental fare with bagels, english muffins, fruit, cereal, yogurt along with coffee, juice, and milk. The most unusual thing about the breakfast was that it does not begin until 8:30. Coffee was out by 8am most mornings, but if your plan is to get an early start on the day, then you'll be eating somewhere else. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay at Chelsea House and would consider it for our next trip to Key West.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cQuaint place to stay and close to Duval St.\u201d", "Author": "DebMCNT", "ReviewID": "UR118115132", "Content": "My husband and I were here for Labor Day weekend.

I personally wouldn't want to stay on the party end of Duval - even a few streets away as this hotel is. We got in late on Friday. They left the key for us in a small lock box and told us via phone where our room was located. They left a letter with instructions and a map of the property which was very helpful. We had to park on the street, but luckily found a spot right on the street in front of Chelsea House. We didn't even move our car - we rode our bikes or walked the whole weekend. They have bike racks for you as well - so don't forget your lock! We checked in Sat morning before having the breakfast. Beth was very helpful and gave us quite a few pointers (and coupons!) on places to eat and things to do. It was a pleasure talking with her. The breakfast was not very good. Very plain with limited choices. I realize it is a continental breakfast, but the items were not \"special\" as would befits such a neat, older house. The items weren't from one of the stellar restaurants around but seemed like they came from Sam's club. Based on that, the next two days we were here we ate out. The only other issue was the bathroom. The shower curtain was too short so water pooled on the floor. I did love the HOT water though! We took quite a number of showers each day because you get hot and sweaty touring around during the day and have to clean up for dinner. We would stay here again if it were just us. We would not bring our kids here - it is a very quiet place (which is what we wanted!) and they wouldn't like it.

Only 2 short blocks off of Duvall St. Far enough away from the noise, but close enough to walk to the heart of that area. 2) The room was very nice, clean, & ecclectic. The whole feel of the room was minimalist but with vintage furniture. The AC worked great & we had a small balcony which gave a clear view of the immediate area. 3) A HUGE PRO.......Free Parking right on the property!! This just in case you haven't been shopping around is a huge deal for this area. 4) The property itself! The House itself is gordous! The property has a quaint smaller pool which is clean & very well enclosed from neighboring properties. THE CON'S: 1) The bathroom situation. OK in fairness this is an B & B and it's an Old House so obviously it wasn't built with 10 to12 bathrooms in it, but the sink was calmost completly clogged (water was very slow to go down & almost over-flowed by the time I brushed my teeth). This kinda of thing should've been checked before we arrived, because it's not like I'm gonna want some random person working in my room with all my stuff layin around. Also the shower is very small. I'm 5'10'' & only 185lbs & I couldn't even turn without hitting my elbow against the walls. And just 1 more thing about the bathroom. You should never....I repeat never!!! have a slatted door on a bathroom! Be advised courtesy flushes are a must. 2) BUGS!!! Our 2nd night we came back to our room to find atleast 50 (from what I was told) flying termites engulfing the lamp in the room we left on! It was so bad I literally had to carry the lamp outside to the balcony & wait 20mins or so for them to fly away! Then after going to sleep I suddenly felt them hitting my face & when I turned the light on another bunch flew right to the lights!! Once I killed the remaining scraggelers we didnt have any additional probs.....but then again we checked out the next day anyway. 3) The WiFi or lack of. The problem is this place advertises having free WiFi & they do, but only in there lobby or in the back court yard (outside). So unless your OK with the bugs & noise outside or OK with having zero privacy when you r doing your work or whatever. The Wi-Fi isn't there. FINAL IMPRESSION: The staff at the Chelsea were very nice & did discount our room to make up for the inconviences we experienced.

However, when I first inspected the bed (to check for bedbugs or anything else) I noticed a fairly large stain that could have been blood or some kind of food stain. Nonetheless, it grossed me out and I never fully got comfortable in the bed even after the maid changed the sheets. And it did not help that the bed, at least to my standards, was like a rock. Unlike other reviewers said, I did not see many bugs. I saw one ant in the bathroom, but that could have happened anywhere. There are large gaps under the doors but I took some of the extra sheets off the bed and wedged them in the gaps and turned the a.c. very cold to deter any bugs. My last complaint was the sofa in the room. It was a lime green and you could see that it was pretty dirty. I would not even sit on it. So overall, I am not sure I would stay here again only because I feel the cleanliness of the room was below par. However, it is a cute room and it is located very conveniently near Duval Street.

At first we were considering Days Inn at $20 less, but when we factored in the price of buying breakfast and a cab ride to Duval street back and forth, we figured it made more sense to stay at the Chelsea House. Not only did we break even financially, we came out far better in many ways than we would have at the Days Inn. Here are all the positives: Chelsea House provided safe parking for our motorcycle on the brick pavement between their two buildings, Duval street is within walking distance, we had a nice continental breakfast by the pool in the morning, the building is historic and has true Key West character, we had a second floor room with a nice balcony where my husband could sit in a rocking chair, smoke a cigar and we could look out on Truman street. The real plus is that we booked a double bed (it was the best we could get for $149) but when we checked into our room, we had a huge king size bed with luxurious pillows and a large, clean room with balcony access. It was mid-week and they were slow, so they provided an upgrade free of charge. What a find! It made our one-night stay in Key West so comfortable and memorable. I highly recommend this hotel. The only negative is that there are roosters in Key West and some like to crow at 2:30 in the morning ( I guess they like to stay up and party late just like the people in KW do). These roosters roam around the town, so this is a problem you may find anywhere in KW, not just in the historic district, so my advice is to come prepared if you don't sleep well. I bought wax earplugs at CVS, stuffed those in my ears, so I muffled out any rooster racket, and I slept like a baby.

The good: We were greeted by Beth, who was very friendly and she was helpful with directions and advice on things to do. The pool was smallish but very nice, clean, and never crowded. The location was great; just far enough from Duval St. The OK: Overall the property seemed generally well cared for; our room could have used some updating but it was clean. The breakfast was sufficient; toast, bagels, muffins, cereal, juice, tea, and coffee. We would have like more fruit options, as they only had apples. It was served on the deck near the pool, which was nice. The bad: My wife and I spent four nights in a double room, which was tiny but adequate in that we were out of the room for the majority of the time; if rain had kept us inside, we may have been divorced by the storm's end due to the close quarters. I would check into larger rooms if I went back. We also found there was nowhere to put anything, particularly in the bath. The shower had no soap dish or shelves for shampoos, washclothes, and other items; we had to keep everything on the floor and keep bending over while inside in a very narrow shower stall. The sink was a pedestal sink which also had nowhere to put anything. There were also no hooks for all of our towels and wet bathing trunks. These sound like minor inconveniences but it became quite annoying, especially in such a tight area. Spending $20 on in-shower storage and some hooks on the wall and/or back of the door would be a vast improvement. The bed was uncomfortable and the pillows felt like large pieces of foam. Definitely not the best night's sleep I've had. The bed had a wooden frame that stuck out much wider than the mattress and boxspring. I banged my leg on the frame more than once while moving around in the small room.

We arrived on Saturday 05/29 before 12pm and we were quite well taken care of at check-in, except that we booked online so the check in time that was printed in our confirmation reflected 03pm and the check out at 12pm (we have the vouchers to confirm this information). We got to the \"Chelsea House\" a little before 12pm and the rooms we not ready. Sylvia, my mother-in-law, got mixed up thinking that the check in was at 12pm and check out at 03pm. The reception desk assistant/clerk/officer/operator Kathy (I want to make sure I don't offend anyone) was gladly outspoken to make my mother-in-law feel bad and understand that she was \"really\" mistaken. Sylvia asked Kathy is she spoke Spanish by any chance as she had a strong accent, maybe British? Kathy responded no, just English. You can imagine, Sylvia is native from Guatemala and her English is just about fair. It was really a silly mistake but even at that moment we WERE NOT advised that the check out time was changed from 12pm to 11am. Kathy was not very happy with the misunderstanding and was not happy with us. We signed the credit card slips and got the keys. Only after we left the hotel on Monday 05/31 that we've noticed in small letters in the bottom of the page, the check out time change. When we signed the credit card slips, the 11am time was never mentioned. We (the 3 of us) were all under the impression that the check out time was at 12pm. We even planned out the last day 05/31 around that time. Kathy got my cell phone number and in fact she called at 02:30pm and left a message on my cell phone advising that the rooms were ready. We came back to the Chelsea House around 4pm and we then brought our luggage upstairs, lots of stairs. Our room was very small. The dark blue carpet in front of our bathroom was wet, not sure if from previous guests or a water leak. We never complained. Days went by and on Monday 05/31 (check out day) we got prepared to leave the Hotel at 12pm. We never received a check out call or reminder. In fact my husband visited the front desk that morning and spoke to Bill requesting a late check out, which was denied. Again the 11am time was not mentioned. At and around 11:40am the housekeeper entered my room WITHOUT knocking which was not the proper way of entering a guest's room. You can check any Hotel operating policy. She got very scared and my small dog barked at her (yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pet's friendly hotel, few rooms only). I was in the bathroom and didn't even have the chance to apologize. She closed the door and left. Right after that, she entered my mother-in-law's room WITHOUT knocking once again. Sylvia (mother-in-law) was in fact naked in the bathroom. What kind of privacy this hotel offers? The nightmare starts now: after 15 minutes of this incident, \"Chuck\" the manager, was standing outside Sylvia's room knocking again, minding you that the hotel had the \"vacancy\" red sign hanging outside. I walk right behind him and informed that we were taking the luggage down (lots of stairs, no elevator) to complete the check out (still under the impression that was at 12pm). When we finally go to the reception, some other guests were doing the check out so we sat outside at the balcony not to disturb. \"Chuck\" came around and said with a weird attitude that we could go in \"right after\" the other guests were done with their check out. We felt that our presence there was really bothering him. So, the other guests left and we walked in. \"Chuck\" directed us to speak to Bill, so we though he was out of the picture. He in fact sat on his chair and watched us. When I was returning my key, Sylvia went to speak to him to inform/complain about the housekeeper entering her room without calling or knocking. Unfortunately my mother-in-law used the term \"maid\" instead of \"housekeeper\" which by no means had a derogatory meaning and is a common word used in Central America for cleaning ladies. Again, she is not fluent in English. \"Chuck\" overreacted and started screaming at us, with a level \"10\" arrogance. He stated that \"he was glad to be in America where you can speak your opinions\". To the Hotel guests ???? I don't think so. What kind of behavior is that ? We were insulted, mistreated and felt very bad. That ruined our trip all together and my poor mother-in-law felt terrible at her own birthday weekend. She didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mean to offend anyone. She just wanted to make a suggestion/complaint and to inform that the shower head was blocked and the water was not running through it very well. \"Chuck\" advised us to get a room at the HYATT for 400.00 a night instead of staying with them again. Also that they didn't need guest \"like us\". What an insult. To top it of, I mentioned to Bill that we were not leaving Key West till down and that we would be back with the second key we got at check in. Again, \"Chuck\" shouted out loud that I would have to pay $20.00 for the missing key. Did he think I was lying? That I wanted to keep an extra key of a room that I would never visit again? Not in this life time anyway. So we did, we came back around 04:30pm, we dropped off the extra key and we finalized arrangements for the bicycles pick-up next morning which worked well with the bicycle staff, but of course, we had to swallow \"Chuck\" unfortunate comment that they were not on the bicycle business and that they would not do us any favors. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! ! ! So, if you want to be mistreated by \"Chuck\" (the manager) come and stay at THE CHELSEA HOUSE, I feel bad for the guest, staff members and the owner of this place who probably is unaware of the manager he has in place.

First off our check-in was a breeze and the free parking was bonus as we had driven the scenic drive down from Miami through the Keys.We walked everywhere during our stay being so close to Duvall Street and all the fun restaurants,bars and great music (It was The Songwriters Festival from April 28-May 2nd so we were very fortunate to be there to enjoy all the talented musicians). We were given one of the beautiful ground floor Suites which I cannot compare to any others as I did not see them but I just loved it.I was told it was the best suite in the B&B and we were very happy to have such a comfortable,private Suite with a large porch and two concrete picnic tables in front that had umbrellas to shade us while we would sit,eat and have a cocktail or two. You can also get Wi-Fi at the concrete tables instead of around the pool if needed. We had 2 French Doors in our Suite that would open up so we could have a nice breeze through the room.The doors were from our sitting area and also from our bedroom out to the large porch. It was also very nice having a fridge in the room to keep our water,beer and whatever else we needed to keep cold. The A/C worked wonderfully along with the ceiling fans in the sitting room and above the king sized bed. I had read some reviews that the beds were not very comfortable and the sheets needed upgrading,WRONG!!!! Well all I can say is it was luxurious to me with the bed being firm but plush which I love and the sheets and pillows were very good quality. One thing I knew about before was that the bathroom was going to be on the small side and there was no counter or storage space so I just brought a little basket to put all my toilettries in and set it on the back of the toilet tank,you just have to be inventive and voilet organized! Our room was steps away from the pool where there is an ice machine and ice water dispenser.In the morning it was so handy to walk out from our room and grab the Continental Breakfast consisting of great hot coffee,O.J,muffins,bagels,toast (toaster provided) yoghurt and fresh fruit.I just loved that we could sit on our porch and enjoy coffee,muffins etc without having to rush around to find a restaurant as I truly enjoy the laid back mornings listening to the birds and looking around the tropical vegetation on the property. The pool was small but a welcome Oasis when the temperatures and humidity were high.The one day we did want to sit poolside it was a little crowded so we went upstair to the Adults Only \"CLOTHING OPTIONAL DECK\" where we were the only ones up there and I could fill in some of my bikini top tan lines,ha!

The bed was hard and linen was very old and dirty looking. The room had french doors and windows however there were no sheer curtains to close when changing....only thick dirty curtains that needed to be pulled most of the time or everyone could see into the room (we were on the first floor).

He gave me a poor explanation of the hotel, other than to say it would be an extra $10 for every hour past checkout if I was late and a drama queen attitude. Here's the lowdown. If you take photos at the right angles, you can make any place look great. The only think historic about this place was the exterior. They have taken every public room away, chopped it up, and jambed in as many hotel rooms as possible into every sqaure inch. There is and entrance hall and stair with two chairs, and that's it. I got a 'superior' queen room. It was superior to sleeping in my car, yes. It had a balcony overlooking the parking lot, some renovations that looked to be done by a handy man and a few trips to Home Depot. It was dark, depressing, small and just dank. It had a shower that was 30\" square with those plastic Home Depot shower walls. The mattress was old. It had no safe and a window a/c that was loud enough to keep you up. Yes, they put a cheap, empty, mini fridge in and a 19\" flat screen and act as if it's renovated. On the positive side, the room was clean. Congrats to the cleaning staff. I had hoped to stay two night for a romantic weekend. I didn't even take the bags out of the car. It killed any romance. The best was two pool towels they put out with a sign saying that if you want to keep one, they'll bill you $20. Who would ever want to take their $1.50 towel from Target home with them I thought? The pool is a rectangle in shade, nothing more. It is servicable, but not inviting. For $159 night in June, they really have to be kidding. There are better places all around this one. Breakfast is basic 'continental'. When voicing my displeasure, instead of getting any kind of apology, all I got was more attitude.

It is one of the few B&B's in Key west that provide parking (even thought you don't need a car in the keys) and also because of the many good reviews on trip advisor. When I booked the room, I was told it was a queen room, newly decorated. The room was very nice, second floor and in the front of the buiding. It was very small!! I really don't think the bed is a queen because my husband and I hardly fit into it. He rolled over and his leg almost went out the window onto the porch! Unfortunately, the roosters across the street kept us up the entire night!! They don't just crow at dawn and the car noise from the street was pretty distracting. The next day we moved into a room in the back which was much bigger, king sized bed, bigger bathroom and much quieter. Unfortunately I was charged more tor this room than the one I booked but still recieved a few bucks off. The keys are very quiet the first three weeks in December, so maybe I should have been more persistent about the price break. The rooms are clean, friendly staff, good location about two blocks from Duval down the southern end. The breakfast was good, mostly bagels, english muffins and fruit, great coffee.

The girl who helped me book a room was very friendly and informative. I booked a superior queen (#21). I have never stayed at a b&b before (I'm a ritz carlton type of girl)and was not sure what to expect, I did not want to stay at a chain, as I wanted to have a key west type of experience. I was very, very happy with my entire stay here. The room was very nice with a larger-than-expected private bathroom. It was very clean and had nice toiletries. (FYI-bath had an attached hairdryer). The cleanliness was noted, as anything else with dirt or a strange hair completely grosses me out! The room also had a nice tv w/remote. My favorite part was the \"private\" balcony. Not like a hotel, but there was a separate door leading out to a patio which had two chairs and a table. The room also came with an empty large mini-fridge, which I stocked w/diet coke, water and beer. Because there is no-smoking inside, it was very nice, relaxing, and convenient to simply open my door and sit outside w/a drink (or coffee in the morning) and read. Re the morning: although it states that the breakfast (continental) is between 830 and 1030, I found that it was ready by 8am. I can't speak to the quality of breads/danishes as I don't eat breakfast, but they looked fresh and plentiful. Most importantly, the coffee was very good and HOT! As I was only staying for a couple of nights, I didn't feel the need to have my room \"made up\" every day. All it took was the \"privacy please\" note on my door and a quick word with housekeeping. She was such a nice lady and INSISTED on giving me more towels (even pool towels even though I wasn't using the pool) and asked repeatedly if I need anything! This is an adult-only facility. While I didn't venture up(stairs) to the clothing-optional pool deck, I really appreciated the calm and relaxing atmosphere--NOT a fan of screaming kids. Re cleanliness- while sitting out on \"my\" patio, I did notice that there was always someone cleaning, sweeping, etc. This is a very well run, professional establishment. Everyone I came in contact with smiled and asked how I was doing. This b&b is on the southern/more quiet side of duval. Its still within walking distance to all you want to do (I recommend the Hemingway House tour) and if you find yourself (which I did) on the rowdier side of duvall, if you don't feel like walking back at the end of the night, its only few-dollar cab ride back. Upon checking out, I had the front desk watch my bag (as my flight was later) and the nice lady insisted on putting it right in front of her desk so she \"could keep an eye\" on it--very nice!

The complex looked nice, the rooms were fine and clean, and the staff was kind. We were there for a two night stay and we had guests visiting from overseas. They told us that they would like to upgrade our rooms and gave us two rooms on the second floor opening to a verandah area. However, the first morning we woke up to loud construction noise at 9 am right outside of our rooms where they seemed to be completely demolishing one of the two stairways leading to the verandah area. There were construction workers all around walking and talking. We tried to accommodate the noise and went to breakfast hoping that the construction was out of dire necessity as they did not warn us about a possible construction work when we reserved our rooms or while checking in. When we came back that night we saw that the stairway was entirely removed. We took a deep breath and thought that that was the end of it. The next morning, however, we again woke up to loud construction noise. This time, it started at 8 am and was coming from the first floor, the second floor (verandah area), and the roof. The construction workers were removing part of the wooden floor on both levels, and they also removed a sizeable area of the roof right in front of our room. Our guests, who were visiting from overseas, packed up immediately and were ready to check out before they even had their breakfast. When we asked the reception about the construction work, they told us that they did not expect it to be very intense. First of all, we find it very unprofessional and insensitive to book rooms in a hotel without warning that there will be construction work. This is a hotel after all where people stay for a limited time. Is it too much to expect peace and quiet when you are on vacation? Secondly, if the reception staff did not really know about the construction, then it is a serious management mistake as the reception staff are the ones who take reservations and place guests into available rooms. Thirdly, they could have acted more promptly and changed our rooms to get us away from the construction zone; it is a large complex with rooms available in two different houses.
