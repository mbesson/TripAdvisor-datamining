Relais 6 is a tasteful hotel near Stefano's home in a more residential area outside the center and was chosen for it proximity to his location. But it turned out to be a great place in its own right which I can highly recommend to any visitor. The room was spectacularly clean, the staff exceptionally friendly and the breakfast, included, was a broad and tasteful spread. It was a very nice place to back to after a long, hard day looking at masterpiece after masterpiece...a great place to kick one's feet up and relax...and I could relax as well because the hotel was good value for the money. I felt well taken care of and I can well recommend it to any visitor to Rome!

The knowledgeable and friendly staff were great; the guy at reception said Hi to my 6 year old by name several times; nice touch and the Bar guy was also nice. We enjoyed going to neighbourhood restaurants which were recommended by staff. I especially liked the completely packed, totally unpretentious and extremely friendly S N Marino; they were great with my 16 month old daughter. This may have been a lucky mistake by us as the hotel recommended San Marino which is just around the corner. Pepe Verde (or similar) also good. We stayed in the apartment on the first floor, which was a little smaller than might be ideal for a party of 5, but generally happy with the rooms. Decent little gym on the top floor. Good breakfast.

Smallish rooms, but not tiny. Spotlessly clean throughout. In some hotels the reception is all glitzy and shiny but by the time you've made it up to your room it's a different story. Not here. It's all very smart throughout. The breakfast is good, lots of different bread, pastries, fruit, cereal, yogurts, juices and so on, but not much in the way of hot options. The coffee was amazing.The breakfast room / lounge / bar area are smart but in a relaxed way. Nothing like a boring chain hotel. It feel more like a home than the cookie-cutter standard global design of most hotels. Staff were smiley, polite and helpful. The hotel is 10 mins walk from Bologna metro station, which is a few stops from Termini, the central stop. The hotel is in a quite posh quiet area with lots of grand houses, but not much else. The nearest restaurants are a few blocks walk away. We went to Pepe Verde, which was pretty good but quite pricey, and La Chiacchiera, which was desperately rubbish. We only went there because it was Easter Sunday and nothing else was open. Avoid this restaurant at all costs. You're better off picking up McDonalds in Termini if nothing else is open. Seriously. The hotel has a small but adequate gym on the top floor. In our booking it said there was a mini-bar in the room which is free on the first night. Don't get too excited about this and expect that you'll be spending your first night drunk on miniature bottles of whiskey and full of peanuts. The free mini-bar actually comprises one can of Fanta, one can of Coke and two bottle of water. Don't let this put you off though. It's a great hotel and a welcome change from boring impersonal chain hotels.

The hotel is situated in the northern parts of Rome with a ten minutes busride to Termini station (The central station of Rome). Our room was very clean and nicely decorated with a nice bathroom. A breakfast buffet was included in the price with different sorts of bread, some sausage and ham, some youghurts, scrambled eggs etc. The breakfast was good but not great. The service in the hotel was impeccable, you can trust the suggestions of restaurants that the service personal provides. The most impressive with this hotel however is that you get very much for very (in comparison with other hotels in Rome) little. We paid 60 euros per night for a four star hotel in Rome. I do not think that any other hotel can match this, if they can, please let us know :). The downside, if any, was that it is not situated in the center of Rome and requires a bus ride just to get to Termini which is not really located in the parts of Rome that you may want to visit. The public transport is not Romes best side, heavy traffic and crowded buses. We would recommend to take the metro if it is possible and stay away from the buses. It is also possible to walk from Termini to Fontana di Trevi and these areas but the stroll was not as short as we would have thought and more than one time we were a little bit frustrated about the lack of effective transportation. And, to take a taxi is not the solution either as the streets are very busy. So, by foot or metro. A day ticket for the metro system and bus system costs 4 euro and can be bought at the hotel. So, would we recommend this hotel? Absolutely! But, be aware that it is situated in a way that requires bus transportation and altough you get to Termini in 10 minutes you may need 30 minutes to get to the touristic center of Rome.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay\u201d", "Author": "flyaquila", "ReviewID": "UR126895477", "Content": "What should I say when everything was super and excellent?

But there was a good selection of cold breakfast options - croissants, bread, cheeses, meats, lots of juices & fruit. The only issue that you really need to be aware of is how far out of town it is. It is at least a 20 minute bus ride in (you can't really walk it), so once you're out for the day, that is it - no popping back to the hotel to get changed before dinner/get a jumper/get rid of your bag.

The bedrooms are very clean and bathrooms have very good showers,beds comfy with feather pillows. Only problem was lack of coathangers but this was addressed at once without a problem. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the guy who runs the bar is brilliant (I think he is called Mem ). Without doubt if we return to Rome we would stay here, its about 15minutes to town on bus (stop less than 2 minutes away) costs 1 euro for a ticket each way.We eat locally at night and restauarant \"Pepe Verde\" just round the corner is very good food and prices. Mixed seafood grill 17euro with swordfish and prawns to die for.All in all an excellent base with good prices, great charm ,nice food and helpful staff.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPetite but well formed!

In all honesty, I had reservations about booking here as at the price we paid, it seemed, well, simply too good to be true. On arrival, the staff were very friendly, and thankfully spoke fluent English, as our knowledge of the Italian language is sparse, to say the least. Our one gripe with Relais 6 came on the first night. We had booked a double room for 3 days, but were mistakenly given a twin room on the first night. I obviously queried this, and was told that they had no double rooms that night, and that they would move us to a new one tomorrow. Not the best start to our romantic getaway, but it was only a minor hiccup. Apart from that, everything was perfect. The breakfast was lovely. Sadly, on our last day, we slept in and missed it. The rooms are decorated well, and have all the amenities required to make your stay comfortable. As others have mentioned, there are a couple of really nice restaurants only minutes from the hotel, all of which are reasonably priced. Contrary to popular rumour, Rome isn't as expensive as most say. For the price you pay, the location of the hotel is fantastic. There are two buses that stop 1 minute from the hotel - 36 and 84 - that take you directly into the centre of Rome. From there you can get a bus to any of the major tourist attractions. I never tried out the tram or rail systems, but have only heard good things about them. As for taxis, they're reasonably priced and fairly easy to find. Unfortunately, on the first night we arrived, there was a taxi strike, which resulted in us waiting 2 hours for a taxi to the hotel. Rome itself is amazing.

I stayed in the apartment 310, we truly loved it, the bedroom was a sunk in room with two twin beds. The living room/breakfast nok was very comfortable, and leads you out to a very large patio that over looks the area/villas. The bathroom was spaceous and the shower, which my room mate was so impressed with, had two tiled seats, nice. Again very clean in deed. Other rooms were equally nice, we had one room that was a loft, room 107junior, while I didn't stay in this room, It was quite unique, loved it. As I said all room were different. The breakfast were great, plentiful, I was quite surprised with all the selections, I have to say, don't look for anything different each day of your stay, But I was okay with it, because I didn't have everything the first time around anyway. The only down side to this hotel is no coffee/tea in room and no Iron/Ironing Board, you have to pay to have clothes pressed and you can only get coffee/tea at breakfast. So bring your own and ask for hot water. All of the staff were helpful. You can buy the ticket for the city bus and for the Hop on Hop off bus at the hotel. But don't let them tell you that you only have a certian time to get on, that is not true. The hop on hop off bus runs until the night and you can get on at any stop durning the hours of operation. We were told that we had to hurry in order to make it and some in our party took off running. We/I got to the bus, I found out that what we were told at the hotel was not true, so I did make them aware of this and told them not to mislead the toursit. I was assured it would not happen again. Overall, I/we LOVED Relais, and would stay their again, I do recommend this Hotel. It is close to the bus line, take the 36 to Termini from their you can get to anywhere. Go out of the hotel, turn left, go to end of block, turn left, go to Via Nomantana turn right, walk down the street past the gas station and on to the end of the block to catch the bus 36.

I chose the hotel because I enjoy staying outside of the city center when I travel -- I appreciate experiencing different neighborhoods, and I don't mind making an extra effort to use public transportation. Relais 6 is exactly the sort of hotel I like: relatively small, elegant, with many \"extras\" that are otherwise unaffordable when you stay in a more central (i.e. more expensive) location. I will admit that sometimes it was frustrating waiting for buses, which were crowded more often then not. But I knew that would be the case when booking the hotel, and for me the pros outweighed that particular con. We received recommendations for two restaurants from two members of the very kind and informed hotel staff, each within a 10-minute walk of the hotel -- a plus after a long day of exploring the city on our feet. Both of them (San Marino and Pepe Verde) were excellent, and filled with locals.

Five weeks before our Rome vacation, we booked a 4 person room directly on the Hotel's website. We were most happy & satisfied with our stay at Relais 6. Even before arriving, we e-mailed the Relais 6 staff with questions and the staff was very prompt in replying back and they were succint in answering each of our questions in English. In fact, they even reserved a private taxi to pick us up at FCO airport to drive us directly to Relais 6 at a fair, fixed price. This really gave us peace of mind to start off our visit in Rome! We also requested a larger room on a higher floor for our stay. Upon check in, the staff was able to honor our request and we stayed on the top floor Junior Suite which had a bed larger than queen size and a queen sized sleeper sofa all in one large room. The very private bathroom was down a short hallway which was all part of the Jr suite. The bathroom had a hairdryer with shower only. The bathroom towels were plush with adequate toiletries. There was daily maid service as well. Our Jr suite had a mini refrigerator stocked with 4 nonalcoholic beverages included in our room rate. The entire Junior suite was indeed very clean, roomy, and ultra quite for sleeping. The bed & sleeper sofa bed were comfortable. The pillows may not be as supportive as some people would like. Everything in the room worked well except the free wireless internet signal was too weak on the top floor. We surfed the internet one floor below us while sitting on one of the public sofas. We never viewed any Italian television, but there was a 19 inch TV monitor in the room. The Jr. suite had direct access to the roof top deck, but we did not have time to enjoy that part of the suite. The exercise room was also on the top floor and the equipment was more than adequate to maintain fitness while on vacation. The included breakfast was fantastic! This buffet style breakfast was one of the best we have ever had. There was a wide selection of foods to meet the needs of many different style tastebuds. Hotel Relais 6 was located in the Northeastern part of Rome about 1 mile outside the boundary of the Ancient Wall. According to our taxi driver, this neighborhood was upper middle class. We felt very safe around the hotel at all times of the day & night. Using public transportation (Bus 60 Expressa), it took us about 30 minutes from the time leaving the hotel to arriving at the Colosseum bus stop and about 25 minutes to arrive at Piazza Venezia which was just before the Colosseum. All in all, Relais 6 was a gem of a place to stay, even the local telephone calls were included in the room rate!

We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus, which takes you directly to Termini. On those occasions when we had wandered very far from the hotel, indulged in dinner and wine, and didn't want to ride a bus, a taxi ride was quick, convenient, and reasonably-priced.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Blackburn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSee Rome and Die\u201d", "Author": "grannie5_11", "ReviewID": "UR118842362", "Content": "Excellent time although the weather was hot and it was late September when we were there would not recommend going in July or August and it was packed.Take comfy shoes and lots of deoderant as the bus journeys are quite an experience and even when its full more people pile on, it gets very friendly !

If interested, if you prefer to get a bus from the Termini to the hotel, the number 36 (this bus can be found in area N) and get of at the Nomentana/Grozia stop which leaves you with only a 250m walk to the hotel. There is also a number 90 which also goes up the Via Nomentana but can't remember the name of the stop as we never took this one. The buses are frequent though.

The hotel is stylish, clean and characterful. The breakfast buffet was very good - plentiful and fresh, from cereals and breads to fruit, meat and cheeses. There are attractive rooms lined with bookshelves and tasteful antiques, with sofas for lounging. On the roof there is a sun terrace and (a rather too public?) mini-gym area, with proper treadmill, stretching area and resistance machine. My room was on the smaller side, but everything was immaculately clean. The bed was very comfortable and I had the best night's sleep for ages. I had a full-size bath, and the aircon was very welcome. I appreciated the free wifi and four free (soft) drinks that were included in my special room rate. The only small drawback was that, travelling to and from the hotel by public transport with suitcases was slightly tiresome (perhaps the 40 degree heat made it seem tougher! - and on Sundays there seemed not to be so many buses). There are several routes from Termini along the nearby major road, Via Nomentana, but the stops are quite a long walk away in either direction.

Once inside the room, to the left was the spacious, clean and powerful shower and bathroom. There was then a long corridor/hall to the main bedroom, with plenty of space and very comfortable beds. The decor was classy, as it was throughout the hotel. Step outside the room and there was a large sun area. Take a walk up a beautiful metal spiral staircase and there was yet another sheltered and private sun area with loungers/table. On our floor there was also a new, fully equipped gym and another sun area. No surprise that we spent the whole afternoon lazing about on, what felt like, our penthouse floor. Breakfast was in a beautifully decorated back room and was substantial, quality and with added extras (for Italy) like scrambled egg. Service was excellent with wonderful coffees served to your table. A short walk away are shops and supermarkets. In the opposite direction is a bus stop with regular buses (every 10 minutes) into Rome and all the sights. Tickets were sold at Reception. It was a fantastic hotel to return to after a busy day sightseeing. An oasis of calm, tranquility and comfort with a log fire, large leather sofas, outside seating areas and even a museum. Everything about the hotel felt new, quality and as if a lot of money had been spent on it. I would recommend this to anyone, but I am not sure whether I want others to know about it. I want it to remain my own hidden gem in Rome.", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cLovely time in a beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "smew142", "ReviewID": "UR103896355", "Content": "We stayed in the Relais 6 for one night and there was nothing to complain about.

Overall we weren't disappointed. The staff were courteous, helpful and all spoke good English. They were forthcoming with answers to whatever questions we had. Our room (104) was quite small but nicely furnished. It was on the 1st floor but the window was not very high off the ground so we weren't happy to leave it open at night without lowering the shutter. The a/c did not work properly and blew out hot air instead of cold. I called a staff member who could not work out what the problem was either. But this wasn't a big problem as the weather was pleasant but not baking hot so it was ok to just have the window open. The walls, floor and ceiling were quite thin. We could hearing people banging around in other rooms and talking in the bar below. One night I was woken by the noise from somebody's tv. I also found the pillow to be too soft but maybe that's just me as my girlfriend said hers was fine. The wi fi signal was 'ok'. The buffet breakfast was very good and varied - coffee made to order, cereal, breads, meat, cheese, yogurt etc. Although there was never much scrambled eggs left when we came down between 9 and 9.30 (breakfast served from 7 - 10) and they didn't refill it. Downstairs next to the breakfast hall was a bar area with sofas and books and newspapers. Free finger food was provided - nuts, crisps etc (we particularly liked the crispy chicken sandwiches!) Out the back were seating areas and a small museum of WWII memorabilia collected by the hotel owner. On the top floor was a small gym with running machine, cross trainer and weight machine and bench. This must be quite new as I didn't notice it mentioned in previous reviews. As mentioned in other reviews, the hotel is located a little bit out of the center. This wasn't a big problem as there were a number of restaurants in the area and the bus stop was just around the corner, from where it was a short journey to the central station and/or the historic center. But with hindsight I would probably have liked to stay a bit more centrally, making it easier to take evening strolls without having to think about taking the bus home.", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, close to bus and Metro.

Fortunately, Relais 6 is an excellent hotel and we had a great stay. Its rather low profile meant that there weren't many other guests, allowing us to fully appreciate its tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean interiors. There were plenty of antiques and old knick-knacks, even a small WWII museum. Room: We booked a standard triple room which felt a little cramped (though the size was probably par for Rome) . Bed and HVAC were good. TV was small and had mostly local channels. Service: Front desk staff were polite and efficient though a bit aloof. Other staff were very friendly and accommodating. Location: Relais 6 is located in a quiet residential area. It's the nicest building along the whole street. There's a pizzeria 5 minutes away by foot (which gets packed during weekends) and there're bus stops a couple of minutes away. It took about 20 minutes to get to Termini station by bus.

The bedroom was spacious and the bed was the most comfortable I have slept on in a hotel. The area around the hotel is lovely and the staff will even reserve a table at a local restaurant (San Marino) for you. The food is lovely and reasonable because locals visit it regularly. There was always a queue waiting for tables. Getting around is easy, and it really is not too far from the heart of Rome. Just 10 minutes on the bus. You can obtain a day ticket for the bus and metro from the hotel for 4 Euros. They provide a map and information on tours. I emailed the hotel after booking and they arranged a car to transfer us from the airport to the hotel for around 50 Euros. It was worth it. Especially as it was our first time to Rome. Breakfast was plentiful. They have a huge choice and it really did get us started for the long days of sight seeing. I was excited about this hotel after reading the reviews and the quick response the hotel gave when emailing them before the trip. They exceeded my expectations and I will be returning again! -Travelling and sightseeing around Rome I would advise jumping on google to get a map of the metro system of Rome. It is very easy, just two lines, but it will prepare you to know where to jump off to get to the sights. Entry to the sights is very reasonable, many are free and some of the guided tours can be way over the odds, especially if a sight is free entry anyway. I would advise purchasing a Roma Pass for 25 euros at one of the tourist offices at termini station. It gives you free travel on the bus and metro for three days. It also gives you free entry into the first two sites you visit. Then you get a discount towards additional sites. One thing to point out, the Roma Pass is not valid at the Vatican. Vatican City is an independent city. Entry to the Vatican is 15 euros, but it is well worth it. It will take a couple of hours to see it all! I would like to say a big thank you to Relais 6.

This was a disappointment, as it was part of the reason that we chose the hotel, but by the end of our stay, we were glad to have been there.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "burbank, ca", "Title": "\u201cDecent Newer Hotel but Not Recommended for Sight-Seeing and Guests on Holiday\u201d", "Author": "valid908", "ReviewID": "UR51974176", "Content": "I have to explain my rating because in some ways this was a good hotel but the overall impression and experience for me personally was poor (so thus my rating). I will give a bit of history to explain my rating: I arrived from a long flight from overseas to visit Rome for pleasure and to see the historical sights. I was going to rent an apt in the Ghetto district with some friends but then decided to stay at this hotel because of the excellent reviews and felt it was better to stay on my own. I didn't realize how far this hotel was from the center of the city and that is my biggest regret in staying here because it was completely inconvenient to the sights and I had to take countless buses and subways to get around and constantly got lost and got packed into sardine cans with people in the buses. Because of this, I couldn't find my friend's most days and since we had no cell phones working it was next to impossible to meet up with them and I only spent 2 days out of the week in rome with them. The hotel staff on the whole is very friendly and helpful and I commend most of their assistance! However, there was a gentlemen that checked me in the 1st day who was very arrogant and rude. He suggested that i take a shower before I ask any further questions about transportation and obviously I smelled bad to him. It could have been so since I had been traveling all day but he shouldn't have asked me to do that and been so rude. The other desk attendants were completely sweet and helpful but he was not and came across consistently snobby and \"above\" me anytime he was working the desk. As for the room, it was decorated nicely but small and the bathroom was probably the best part since it had a shower and a bathtub and was big (for Europe). The room was fairly clean but my night-stands were consistently dusty so i think that the maid service doesn't dust at all. There was a mini-bar but it only contained a couple of bottled waters and soda (no alcohol). The location of this hotel is the worst part because it's not close to the center of Rome and you have to take the buses to the Termini and then take the subway which can be a real bother! Especially when the buses take forever to come and you have to be squished next to tons of peeps and so it's not good for the claustrophobic (like me)! Steer clear from this hotel just on the basis of location unless you are in Rome for business and have your own car or transportation. On a positive note: The daily breakfast buffet is very nice and the cooks (chefs) very friendly and helpful. There was one young guy in particular that was completely sweet and always wanted to help. Another lady that was his sub that I had during the weekend was very snobby though since I didn't speak Italian. There is also Internet access downstairs on one computer which is free of charge and is nice for people that didn't bring their laptop or hardware with them. There are also blinds in the room that you can scroll up and down which is nice if you want to make the room completely dark or have natural light. Word of caution: There is consistent construction noise in the building next door during the day so if you want a mid-day nap - you might have trouble falling and staying asleep. Also this hotel caters from what I saw to mainly local italians that are here for business and there was a lady that worked for the hotel that as I walked by laughed and said \"turista\" (hee hee) to a group of Italians that she was assisting and I was extremely offended by her remark and the fact that she was making fun of me being one of the few tourists of the hotel. She did it right in front of my face too and I just mimicked her laugh and made fun of her back (to her face) ridiculous! (considering the \"TURISTAS\" are her bread and butter). So overall I have to not recommend this hotel even though I did really appreciate some of the nice desk and kitchen staff here. I especially enjoyed this older desk attendant who was completely charming and had a very funny sense of humor which i greatly appreciated being pretty much by myself in a foreign country and not knowing the language. So the bottom line: If you are a \"turista\" wanting to get in to Rome to enjoy the nightlife and see as much as you can then please find a hotel closer and more user-friendly with foreign tourists!", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cA real hidden gem\u201d", "Author": "rosmarLondon", "ReviewID": "UR50702852", "Content": "We stayed at Relais 6 for 5 nights and we had the most amazing experience.

The hotel does not have a restaurant, but there were some great local places nearby. Breakfast was good, served in a nice room with views to the back garden. The lounge of the hotel, was beautiful. Tastefully decorated. The hotel is located 10 -15 min bus ride from the city centre. Buses are frequent and stop near the hotel. Night buses also serve this area, and we found it very easy to use the network - also nice to go back to a quiet area after spending the day in busy Rome. The service was outstanding. All the staff were very helpful and friendly, but not intrusive. The guy serving the breakfast during the weekdays was very attentive, made great coffee, and ran the place so smothly you would not even notice he was there but everythig was set up to perfection.

It is a visual delight. The hotel is located in a high rent residental neighborhood that also contains several embassies. If you go to the restaurants within easy walking distance you may be the only tourist there. For us this turned out to be a great plus as unfortunately, some of the restaurants in the tourist areas view cheating tourists as a sport. Our favorite local restaurant is San Marino Pizza which also serves a variety of dishes.(Great thin crust pizza; pasta and bean soup that will ruin your enjoyment of the same served at most American restaurants, and half a liter of wine for 3 euros.) The neighborhood restaurants are in the business of seeking repeat business from customers and treat all their customers very well. If you only have a couple of days in Rome and want to try and see all the historical sights and want or need to go to your hotel in between sights, this is not the hotel for you. The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from the Bologna subway station on the Blue Line. Most of the historical sights are either on the Blue Line or require transfer to the Red Line at Termini where the two lines cross. There is a bus 3 blocks away that will take you to either the Bologna station or Termini. For the Bologna station take either the 310 or 93 if you don't want to walk. The subway trains run every couple of minutes. The only drawback is that sometimes you pack in pretty tight, ditto for the busses. Rome is appallingly covered with graffitti; the graffitti in the neighboorhood of the hotel does not indicate a lack of safety,but on first arrrival it is disconcerting. Ditto for the security shutters on the hotel's windows. You see them all over Rome and they make for a great black out if you arrive tired and want to sleep in late. We stayed seven nights and sought advice about the city from several desk clerks. All but one were unfailing polite. One, when asked what bus to take to the subway replied, \"I am not God; I do not know everything.\" However, on other occasions this clerk was gracious. Overall, I would rate the service excellent. If you arrive at FCO you can take a cab to the hotel. The average price is supposed to be 50 euros, but we paid 58. Or you can take an express train (11 or 12 euros per person) to Termini and then either take a cab (about 10 euros) or just take the subway to Bologna station and then walk. (It helps is you arm yourself with a Google map beforehand). Returning to the airport, you have the hotel arrange a private car (50 Euros) or use public transportation. We chose the private car and were very pleased. If you don't want to do public transportation to get to the hotel I would recommend calling them and asking them to have a car for you. Overall, we were very pleased with this hotel, found the staff friendly and helpful, and after the first couple of days were delighted to be outside the tourist area in an upscale neighborhood. If you don't mind being crowded on the subway, the subway is fast and safe.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "milan, italy", "Title": "\u201cExcellent in every respect\u201d", "Author": "lucaerrante", "ReviewID": "UR47401135", "Content": "Where also can you find in Rome, where the vast majority of the hotels seem to be hugely overpriced, a brand new hotel, situated in a quiet area, with comfortable and well appointed rooms, for just 80 euros/night?
