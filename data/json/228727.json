Skip ahead 40 years, two kids, 3grand kids and I was finally able to introduce my husband to the most beautiful city I've ever seen. To my disappointment I could not locate the Round Point. So after searching every available avenue, I asked my travel agent to find a small hotel, at least 3 stars in a good location. Oh my! He delivered the West-End Hotel. We were the first of his clients to stay at this perfect small hotel in the heart of the designer shopping district. There is nothing I would change about our experience there. A breakfast was included,but we never took advantage of it because the bed was so comfy. We could walk to all the major sites, but we also could have stayed in the neighborhood and had an amazing time. Up the street is a beautiful bakery and on the corner a block up is a wonderful cafe that served the best lamb I have ever eaten. Across the street from the cafe was a magnificent Asian restaurant, We traveled to Paris from Venice over night on the train so we were very tired. The hotel accommodated us by allowing an early check-in. At dusk we walked to the Chinese restaurant. My husband was seated across from me. Over his right shoulder was a magnificent view of the Eiffel Tower. When darkness fell and the tower began twinkling, I told him to turn around and look. He was instantly in love with Paris! From shopping to eating to site seeing this hotel made everything exceptionally easy. I can't wait to return and I won't wait 40 years this time.

Prior to our trip we contacted the hotel to arrange a dinner reservation for Christmas day as the hotel does not have its own restaurant. We found all of the staff that we dealt with very helpful and the restaurant chosen, La Fermette Marbeuf (just down the road) was excellent. The rooms were very comfortable and clean, especially the superior room we had to book for the boys to get a twin. The breakfast was served late into the morning which was great as the boys are not early risers. The breakfast room was small, but the choice was good, as was the service. The location was ideal for the Champs Elysees and the Eifel Tower (which we could see from our balcony, if you craned you craned your neck) and a short walk from a number of Metro stations.

This is a centrally located boutique hotel, tucked into a small, quiet side-side-side street. We were pleasantly surprised to get a room with a lovely balcony and a view of the top of the Eiffel tower even though we only booked a basic room. The room itself was reasonably spacious for what it was, relative to European hotels... don't go to Europe for spacious hotel rooms unless you have thousands of dollars to spare! The hotel staff was polite except for one female receptionist who I had a feeling may have had a bit of a chip on her shoulder and was a bit unfriendly with my husband and I, possibly because of our age, in our upper 20s we were by far the youngest to stay at the hotel. She made a few snide remarks a couple of times. The other receptionists (male) were kind, helpful, and polite. The hotel staff speaks fluent English. Even though we are from Quebec and speak fluent French, detecting our accent they still switched to English for us at times. Breakfast was delicious: it had all the basics including fresh pastries and baguettes with gourmet jam and honey, juice, fruit, pound cake, tea or absolutely delicious coffee (I suggest the cafe au lait...still have dreams about it!), yogurt, cereal. The rooms have ipod docks which were handy (no need to bring your charger on the plane) and nice flat screen tvs. They also have small mini-fridges which we were able to store some sandwiches and salads in from local grocery stores instead of having to eat every meal out. Overall I was impressed by the cleanliness, comfort of the bed and the rooms, the balcony with a table and chairs and the view.

Late at night there were alot of people walking around the street below which you could hear clearly. In the morning the room cleaning lady came around about 7.30-8am, which meant no sleep in's as even if you put a 'do not disturb' sign on the door, you could still hear her cleaning the other rooms (vacuuming, banging round etc) as the walls were so thin. You could hear other guests in their rooms also. Limited choices on the room service menu - when we tried to order we were told what we wanted wasn't available, so we chose something else, which wasn't available either. The food that was finally available to order was not very nice. I was bitten quite badly by fleas (or bed bugs?) on the first 2 nights of our stay which wasn't plesant to have red itchy bites all over while on holiday. The bed was hard and lumpy, which caused my back to ache the whole time of our stay. So what with the noise, the terrible bed and the early starts of the room cleaning, sleeping was an issue at this hotel for me. The breakfasts had a good selection of food choices if you ate it in the painfully quiet small crowded breakfast room downstairs, but if you wanted to eat in your room (which was encouraged), you had to pay extra for things like yoghurt, fruit and cereals, which were 'free' downstairs.

The location of this hotel cannot be beat! Rue Clement Marot is a quiet little street in the middle of all the action- nestled between Ave Montaigne and Ave George V- I can't believe this hotel was so affordable. Ave Montaigne has all the best luxury stores- Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Harry Winston... and Ave George V is home to the Paris Four Seasons... The Fouquets Barrier hotel is also right around the corner. Hotel West End was situated right next to all the best Paris has to offer for a fraction of the price of other hotels. All the major sights are within walking distance. We walked to the Arc De Triomphe, The Grand and Petit Palais, the Plaza de Concorde and Tuilleries Garden. We had lunch at cafes on the Champs-Elysees every day. The bank of the Seine River is just a short stroll down Ave Montaigne. We booked an executive level room (Room 503) and our room had a wrap around balcony with a panoramic view, I think it must have been the best room in the hotel. We could see the top of the Eiffel Tower and enjoyed watching it sparkle at night from the privacy of our balcony. The room was big by European standards, and had 4 large window/doors that opened to the balcony. The bathroom was nice with a lot of counter space. The bath tub had a wall-mounted shower head as well as a separate hand-held shower head. (The tub was elevated pretty high and some travelers with mobility issues might have a hard time getting in and out, but it wasn't a problem for us) The bathroom even had a really great hair dryer! I'm wary of relying on hotel hair dryers and this one was powerful and worked like a charm. The staff at the front desk was always friendly and accommodating. We were there celebrating our 5th anniversary and the receptionist arranged to have our room filled with flowers and rose petals at the spur of the moment. The breakfast buffet was always fresh and a great way to save a few Euros every day. The internet access wasn't free, but it was very reasonable. I think we paid 10 euro for 6 hours of access which was really all we needed. Overall, the Paris West End hotel is charming. It's a beautiful facility, intimate and quiet, but right in the middle of where you want to be. The streets around the hotel are lined with cafes, bars and pharmacies. It was very easy to navigate the city from this hotel and it was a real bargain for it's location. I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

This place is a nice little boutique hotel 2 or 3 blocks away from Champs d'Elise. Reception - tastefully decorated, small but cosy and inviting. Reception staff spoke very good english and during the 5 days we stayed at the hotel, we only had to deal with 2 or 3 different people as the hotel is really small and they normally had 1 or 2 people at the reception. The gentleman at the front desk was pleasant and polite and provided us with sufficient information when we asked for directions etc. The reception also organised our tickets to see the crazy horse show and were very helpful. By the way, do not go to see Crazy Horse, it was so boring my husband and I fell asleep. Room - We stayed in the basic room which was really tiny but I must say it was clean and newly renovated/decorated. The bathroom was again very small but all new fittings and marble tiles so it was pleasant. I looked at over 50 different hotels in Paris before deciding on this place. The main reasons for choosing Westend hotel was based on price, location and pictures and reviews I had seen from tripadvisor. Bathroom and cleanliness are the two major things I look for in an accommodation and this place fit the bill. Although it wasn't cheap by any means, it was cheaper than many other places that looked worn and old with 4/5 stars. We had a small balcony which we basically used as a fridge as it was very cold outside. We could also see the Eiffel tower in the distance from the balcony. They had a little Ipod docking station which came in handy. The bed was a little small as it was only a double bed. I think they call it a queen size bed but it was much smaller than our bed at home. The heating was great in the room and overall we were happy with this hotel. Continental breakfast was included in the price which included all the pastries, cereal, fruit salad, tea and coffee. They have the most gorgeous croissants and we stocked up on breakfast as we walked absolutely everywhere. The Metro station is only a 5 min walk away but there's so much to see that you can miss a lot if you don't do Paris by foot. The down sides to this hotel are: 1. All the restaurants and cafes near by are very very expensive as it's in a ritzy part of Paris. 2. It's not close to a supermarket so we ended up stocking up on drinks/snacks during the day when we were in other parts of Paris and brought it back with us. 3. The elevator in the hotel can only fit 2 -3 people max - it is sooo small. But it has beautiful stairs and we stayed on the 3rd floor so I walked up and down to burn off the pastries. We only saw 3 other people during our stay so we didn't have to share the lift most of the time. 4. They only have one computer for internet. You have to buy the internet card from reception and it was really expensive. The computer didn't work for a few days during our stay so we didn't even get to use up our credit. This area as I said is very ritzy so if you want the small streets with markets and cheaper eateries, the south side of the river is better. We ended up spending a lot more time in St Germain as there were a lot more things that we were interested in like boutique shops and restaurants.

First, the few good points: our \"executive\" room was relatively spacious compared to other hotels in Paris where we have stayed over the the years and came with a cute balcony overlooking rue Clement Marot, but it also did cost us more, at their \"promotion\" rate of 279 Euros per night. The continental breakfasts for 2 were included in the price and were plentiful with a good variety including fresh fruits; the gentleman overseeing the breakfast room was polite and attentive. The ladies at the reception desk were uniformly polite and helpful (please see below regarding the rude men at the reception desk). The location was great with numerous good bistrots and restaurants nearby as well as several fashion powerhouses. Negative: Room: for a hotel which bills itself as sophisticated and for the rates that it commands, we were rather disgusted that the some of the bathroom amenities were partially filled with water (or some clear liquid) to make them look full, but the colorless water-like liquid was rather clearly demarcated from the colored shampoo or bath gel -- petty and crude! The plumbing in the bathroom was substandard and required multiple flushings for rather simple and straightforward operations. We have to assume that the towels were clean but we also noted that all had an odd grey color, suggesting that it might be time for management to consider a new supply of towels or perhaps simply bleach. There were no face towels, bathrobes, or slippers -- for an \"executive\" room??? Service: We were most appalled by the rude service rendered by the men at the reception desk. At check-in, after I introduced myself, one man told me how my name is pronounced in French, except for the obvious fact that it's NOT a French name by any stretch of one's imagination. He next proceeded to instruct his colleagues with a great deal of sarcastic fanfare how my name should be pronounced. Frankly, I don't care how it's pronounced by a hotel reception clerk, hence the silleness of this entire incident which the man single-handedly instigated. Oh, and he insisted to conduct this entire affair in French, which I obliged, whereas the woman at the desk during the same time period asked more houghtfully if I would prefer to communicate in French or in English. The next morning, a different man at the reception desk told me that my taxi which I had asked the desk to arrange for a 9AM pick-up was not there yet because it wasn't 9AM yet, except for the fact that the woman at the desk at the same time must have been using a different clock, since she thought that it was in fact already nine and proposed that we went ahead with the taxi that was already there! And of course, throughout this entire episode, the man spoke French whereas the woman spoke English. As if to emphasize that this was neither an issue with an individual staff member nor a training issue, the supervisor -- a yet different man-- who walked by the breakfast room in the morning did not even make eye contact, smile, or offer a simple greeting to any of his guests -- hardly a role model for best customer service! We had picked this hotel mostly for convenience. We had a one-night stopover in Paris on our way back to the US from Tunisia and wanted to stay somewhere close to the Theatre des Champs Elysees for a concert there that evening, and also to be able to access the Air France airport bus to CDG for our flights. In that sense, the location worked out well. Otherwise, this hotel masquerades as a classy operation but is instead petty with poor values, and its male staff needs to be either re-trained, or else Hotel West End should make very clear the kind of customers whom it does or does not serve, or whether it has instructed its male staff to carry on the caricature of snooty and rude customer service in France of long ago. No business engaged in the hospitality industry should take money from its clients if it is not able to treat its clients with a modicum of courtesy. We travel to Europe frequently both for business and for personal purposes and have never minded the cost if the businesses make a reasonable effort to earn it. We have enjoyed our stays at other hotels in Paris as well as as other parts of France and have never encountered this kind of operation.

Cute foyer with comfy chairs, handpicked (although odd and ecclectic) artwork throughout, one tiny elevator for all 6 (?) floors. Staff spoke several languages and were very helpful: early check-in, taxi requests, dinner reservations, baggage storage. I will definitely tell my friends about this place!", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "syria", "Title": "\u201cA hidden Gem\u201d", "Author": "didoooz", "ReviewID": "UR21526314", "Content": "I stayed for 5 nights, in this boutique hotel, and I have to say it was a very good experience.
