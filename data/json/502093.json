The service here is great. Ameneties, not so much. This hotel doesn't even have a computer for guests, which I found shocking. The rooms don't have a TV with demand (they just have basic cable) and the there is a serious sound issue here. We had to move rooms after the first night because the floors were literally shaking from the club beats below us. I get the impression that people come here to party- in fact, we had a party going on in the room across from us until 5am! I also get the impression that this hotel is experiencing an identity crisis of some sort. You walk into this beautiful lounge/restaurant- the decorations and design are gorgeous and then you see the chairs at the tables and they are PLASTIC!! Like... lawn chair style. We just couldn't dine there because of this. I came to the conclusion that club and 4-5 star hotel do not mix. This type of mix is best suited for a hostel or lower end hotel with rooms at 60-80$ a night. The hotel is trying to attract young people with money.... problem is, there aren't enough young rich kids out there to keep this hotel a-float. If they improved their amenities, changed their club into a lounge (And JUST a lounge) and classed up their restaurant a bit, they may have a chance.

Except for the limited drop-off area in front of the hotel on busy Sherbrooke Street, the reception was warm and helpful and the room exceeded our expectations - modern and chic with many creature comforts including a Keurig coffer/tea maker and a small fridge in the room. Dinner at Koko's Restaurant Friday evening was delicious and the ambiance perfect. We were told at check-in that the hotel is a lively nightclub on the weekends and were given a room on the side of the hotel (Clark Street) away from the loud music. This proved to be prophetic as, by around two in the morning, the din of the pounding music was audible and kept us awake. This was nothing compared to Saturday night when around three o'clock we were awakened by what first was a lot of shouting and then police sirens as a melee of drunk patrons spilled into the street only to end in hospitalized bar employees and many detained participants taken away on a 'special' city bus. We mentioned the evening's 'entertainment' to the front desk at check-out and it was then they admitted, somewhat sheepishly, that this particular Saturday night was inordinately violent and exceptional. Was it? Why is a fine boutique hotel in an excellent location with a trendy restaurant serving taste-tempting food being tarnished by the unbridled hedonism of its lucrative bar. Control and coordination of the restaurant/bar vis-a-vis the hotel operation should be management's top priority or risk losing the upscale tony facade it attempts to project to the public.

We are a young couple in our late 20's, so not usually ones to complain about the noise because we are usually out late ourselves...but we honestly didn't fall asleep until 3am both nights because the hotel's club was right underneath us and I felt like I was in the club trying to sleep. I could literally sing along to every song they played. The hotel actually provided us with earplugs on our nightstand each night, thought that was kind of amusing when we first saw them...until we actually had to use them. I'm not sure if they placed us right above the club because they saw we are younger, or maybe because we had a discount deal, but we kept commenting to each other that if anyone our parent's age stayed here (or anyone looking for a good night's sleep for that matter) they would be outraged. Maybe there are quieter floors in the hotel, but we were on the 4th floor over the club and the noise was definitely an issue. We did not ask to change rooms after the first night because we didn't want to go through the hassle because we were in an adjoining room next to friends.

In the morning, we went downstairs to a delicious continental breakfast, including bacon, eggs, sausages, croissants and other breakfast staples. Much like check-in, check-out was also very fast and friendly, and the valet parking attendant was particularly cordial: he even held open the passenger door for my fianc\u00c3\u00a9e upon returning my car to us!

We were on the fifth floor and I'm deaf in one ear and still had a hard time with the noise level. The next morning we headed down for breakfast and were told by the same rude girl at the front desk that we weren't entitled to breakfast vouchers with our deal. I explained that the deal I bought clearly said breakfast at the restaurant. She interrupted me to say \"listen, it's not a big deal, just take these vouchers and go.\" I felt totally demeaned, like I'm trying to rip her off for a freaking buffet breakfast? Give me a break! The food was cold, the cheap plastic lawn chairs in the restaurant were very tacky. The rooms are decorated to look urban and cool and appealing at first, but the dim lighting eventually reveals that the black tiles in the bathroom are actually painted black (over tile and grout and all...) with what looks like tremclad. The carpet is thread-bare and the single macaron on my pillow was pretty lame when there are clearly 2 guests. Save yourself the $200+ / night and stay in a real hotel.

It's a far walk from the old city and business districts however. The immediate neighborhood isn't inspiring but is clean and safe. The Club: As many, many other reviewers pointed out, the noise from the club is no joke. I called twice to ensure a top-floor room as far as possible from the club and was glad I did. However, when the place closes at 2:00 am, it sounds like a riot is breaking out on all the surrounding streets --screaming, car horns, etc. This woke me up out of a sound sleep two nights in a row, even though the windows were closed. (I'm from New York City so I'm used to urban noise. This was exceptional.) And BTW, whoever characterized this club as \"hip\" needs to get out more. It feels like a north-of-the-border Jersey Shore outing -- lots of cologne and shiny shirts, drunk girls in prom dresses who can't walk on their high heels and club hits from 5 years ago. Montreal has great nightlife. Not here. The Rooms: Our room was modern, clean, and very comfy. The TV situation is very 90s but that's a small detail. GF approved of the hair drier and shower. Bed was wonderful. The lighting indeed isn't great but not as bad as other reviews make it out to be. The Staff: Good looking, nice, and mostly clueless/useless. When our taxi pulled up, the doorman recognized the driver and they struck up a wonderful-sounding conversation in their own language and we were completely ignored. I took in my own bags and let him catch up with his friend. I'd called twice to ensure a top (5th) floor room and was given one on the third floor. With a little gentle insistence this was taken care of. The next day it rained and there was no umbrella in my room. I asked for one at the front desk and they sent me to the doorman, who sent me back to the front desk. I asked if there was a place nearby I could just buy an umbrella and she had no clue. Finally she checked again and found one but made me promise I'd bring it back. I offered to sign over my first born and she just stared at me. In general, the staff was unfamiliar with the area and unable to suggest even the simplest things, like the closest coffee shop. Did I mention they were good looking?

On the other hand, my room was perfect--everything was in perfect condition in the room. I appreciated the comfortable bed, the spacious bathroom and huge soaker tub. I had a leather bench in front of a big bay window. While we were there, they were repainting the walls of the halls on our floor, so maybe they are working on making updates. In addition, the Opus Montreal accepts dogs! This was absolutely fabulous, as not many higher end hotels accept dogs. So I really didn't mind that carpet in the hall was worn. My dog also made the lobby carpet and tile floor wet and muddy (because it rained the entire time we were in Montreal) and the staff didn't bat an eye. It was fine.

After booking online, I read the reviews so I called and requested an upper room because I read about the noise level. The room was nice-- very modern. Clean, and spacious.

Once upstairs, yes we could hear the noise, but it was not too bad. After hot showers, and a little TV we were exhausted from all the walking we did. I fell asleep fast and didnt wake up until morning. Breakfast was great! Eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, cereals and lots of fruit. The breakfast was served in the same room that all the dancing took place the night before. The second night the same noise, but again, not a real problem. Hubby did go down there to see what was going on. He said it was room to room people, dancing, mingling, drinking. It seems to be a very popular place. He talked to the door man who said alot of people going to the club will get together and book a room. All in all, the staff was helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel itself is very modern.

Upon entering you can order bottle service and around $180.00 a bottle or you can go drink by drink for $10.00 a pop. Live DJ, great atmosphere but very pricey.

In fact, I strongly recommend that you stay elsewhere. My Dad was speaking to a member of the front desk staff and he boasted that their night club is one of the most popular in all of Montreal. Great for them (?) but this is at the expense of their hotel guests. The majority of the rooms in this low-rise hotel sit directly above and around their ridiculously loud night club. It is honestly one of the most horrible stays I've ever had, which is especially disappointing considering the potential of the hotel. Reading very similar bad reviews from numerous other people, it astounds me that the hotel chooses the success of their night club at the expense of their hotel guests. Is this not primarily a hotel? How well can the night club be doing that they jeopardize the hotel experience? It's mind boggling. I read the reviews before arriving (after we had already booked) and like many of you (I assume) hoped that I would be the lucky one who would not be affected by the noise. How wrong I was! I'm sitting in the lobby typing this review and there has already been two other groups who have demanded a room change, not including us. When my Dad asked the front desk staff for a room change, they told him that, unfortunately, they didn't have any other rooms with two beds (family trip) on the other side of the hotel. They said they did have a room on a higher floor but that it wouldn't make a difference. Last night at 12:30AM, after tossing and turning for an hour due to the incredible noise, I was forced to walk to a nearby pharmacy to get ear plugs. Even with the ear plugs cutting most of the noise, you could still feel the incredibly loud bass pumping through the hotel. I'm sitting here writing this review and DREADING having to stay another two nights. UGH. This has put such a damper on the trip. Honestly, for $200/night, I'd rather sleep in a park at this point.

Opus is our hotel of choice in Montreal since it's pretty hip and in a good location, and generally delivers very good value on the room rate. You are a short walk to Ste Catherine and right at the bottom of the Saint Laurent restaurants and club row. You are however a bit of a hike to Old Montreal but if it's summer you can walk easily or a short cab ride around $10. The Opus is a NYC style kind of minimalist dark kind of vibe everywhere with sealed concrete ceilings, black tile showers etc. The rooms are pretty dark even with the lighting available. The carpet is starting to look a bit worn in both the rooms and the hallways but it's not at the point yet where it detracts from the overall vibe. This is not a super quiet hotel given they have a very cool lobby bar/restaurant and outdoor courtyard that is frequently used to events and a nightclub. It's never really been an issue for me to sleep and not every time i've been there has there been some large noisy event downstairs but if you are the person that needs absolute quiet and any kind of noise is going to bother you - this is not the place for you. I'd suggest the W or Sofitel. There is a continental breakfast which is usually included in our room rate which is pretty good - bagels, yogurt, juice, fruit etc. The restaurant/bar is all black and white with designer furnishings and booths. My favourite is the horse lamp - there is a full sized horse that has a lampshade on it - look for it.

The hotel itself is very well located near restaurants and shops, with very funky and attractive decor. The rooms themselves are lovely with comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. The only suggestions I would make are (a) there be brighter lighting and more light fixtures (almost all the participants felt the rooms were too dark) (b) that the hotel put up some sheers or light curtains on the windows behind the heavy blinds/curtains- if you close the curtains, it's too dark and if you leave them open, the neighbouring buildings look right into your room so there is a need for sheers, and (c) new carpets - the carpets in some parts of the hotel were looking a bit tired and grubby. These are just suggestions for the owner to make it perfect! The meeting rooms were really great - well lit and attractive spaces. I loved the Koko Restaurant and Suco Lounge, which by day are lovely bright and airy breakfast and lunch rooms, and by night very funky night clubs. I loved how they changed our seating arrangements for every meal - made it very interesting and we never knew what to expect. The food was really wonderful and beautifully presented. Even sandwiches were made to look like edible art, lots of it and very tasty. Nothing was too difficult and the staff were very obliging, attentive, accommodating and friendly. My first contact was the Sales Manager, Yves - he was very quick to respond to queries, attentive to our needs, cooperative, and extremely welcoming. Emilie, Sabrina and Maryam were fantastic on the rooming lists and catering, always responding promptly and adjusting to last minute changes without hesitation. Moy, the Maitre d'Hotel with whom I liaised daily on food and room arrangements, was so incredibly good at what he does, efficient, always polite, quick to repond and always with a warm smile. Everyone worked happily; I didn't hear one word of complaint nor did I see one look of irritation from anyone. Without exception all our participants loved the hotel and said everything was fantastic [except for the small issue of the dark rooms!].

The hotel is very nice. Rooms were big and open, nice comfy bed and great shower and bathroom. A continental breakfast was included and set up in the lobby every morning. I think there was free wi fi downstairs too. Small gym but well equipped. We didn't do any meals at the restaurant but we did do cocktails at KoKo. Everything seemed in lined with the rest of the hotel. They did their version of a New York boutique style hotel. The game changer was on Saturday night. There is a club in the basement and you can hear the music through the entire place. We actually went into the club on Saturday just to see and have a drink. Be prepared for everyone to be 25 and under and loud club music throughout. It is impossible to talk. We did it just for fun. Our group ranges from mid 30-late 40s so we had a laugh looking at the young folks mingle in ridiculous outfits. After feeling like we were too old we went back to our rooms and I noticed that young folks were going in and out of rooms throughout the evening. It reminded me of my graduation night when me and a group of friends pooled together some money to stay overnight at a hotel. Someone probably begged their parent to charge the room to the card and all of their friends just piled in for the evening. So it was a little noisier than we would have liked on Saturday but it eventually died down. We also had a room outside of the elevator so we kept hearing the door open and close. The good thing is that the hotel was quiet again on Sunday night. Location of the hotel is great if you plan on clubbing and dining on St Laurent. But I think I'll be staying in Old Montreal next time. Old Montreal has some of the nicer restaurants and shops. Next time I will walk or take a short cab ride down to st laurent and but I like a nice quiet sleep and I didn't get that on Saturday in this neighbourhood. And just like the club at the hotel, the entire strip of St Laurent is club central. The restaurants all turn into discos after 10pm. So if you don't like noise or young silly people stay somewhere else.

Restaurant & Lounge is indeed one of the cities best, which makes you kinda smile concerning all the comments about noise. Yes, there is ambiance in the Lobby and on their outside terrace in the evenings, and even a really trendy one.

This LOOKS like a classy, sweet little boutique hotel as the advertisements boast, but this place will disappoint anyone looking for a quiet and well-maintained hotel. I got a room at a lower rate than usual (maybe a slower time?) but then I also noticed that suddenly things weren't available to me, like the free continental breakfast that everyone else seemed to have or a room switch. I stayed in Room 417; dark and dingy. The sheets were clean but the carpeting is absolutely worn out, the furniture doors are falling apart so cupboards wouldn't close properly, the inside of the mini bar was filthy with spilled juice. Perhaps they thought none of this would be noticed since they keep the rooms very dark - the lighting is ridiculously dim and the walls a dark, bordello red. Whenever I called down to reception, they were so busy they would never answer. One woman at reception was irritated when I cam down to tell her that the room was too dark. I was wearing jeans and when she realized that I had a \"king\" room (whatever that means,) she said, \"oh I thought you were in a budget room.\" ?????? How rude. And even though she made a show of looking for another room for me and even though the hotel was empty, as they kept telling me, there was no other room to switch to. Such liars. When I needed my car for the evening from the \"valet only\" parking situation here (and don't even think about retrieving anything from your car once they take it to park -- \"not done\",) the valet took 25 minutes to get my car out! After an exhausting evening of waiting for my car, waiting for reception, waiting to be connected to room service (that took 5 different phone calls!,) I thought I would have a peaceful night's sleep. But at 2:30 AM, young men were running up and down the hallway screaming as only drunk people do at the top of their lungs banging on each other's doors!! Now I realized why I needed the earplugs that were supplied by the bedside; for the unruly guests that have left the deafening night club downstairs. This is not a well run hotel and while some of the staff were nice, most were indignant, pompous and rude.

The reception clerk told us the room on the 5th was reserved for us since we wanted something quiet (club below so it gets loud) but it wasn't ready. The room was vacant and should be cleaned soon. They kept our bags while we did some walking around in old Montreal (nice but nothing like Quebec City). We came back at 3:00 and a new reception clerk checked us in.

The room on the 4th would have been fine but the whole lying thing bothered me.

From reading other reviews, we requested a room on the 5th floor and had absolutely NO problem with noise/vibrations from the bar. The service for our room was great. Our bed was made daily, the radio was turned on to a classical station to welcome us whenever we arrived at night, all bathroom products were promptly replaced even before they were half-done and the \"refill boy\" came by a number of times to ask if our coffee machine needed refills. Even if we left with the Do Not Disturb sign on, the cleaning lady always made sure to ask us if we needed extra towels, etc. when we ran into her. The front desk was also very helpful, and it seemed that there was always someone opening the front door regardless of the time of night (or morning) we came in. By far the greatest PRO would be the great location: On St. Laurent with the trendiest restaurants and boutiques; a walk away from St. Catherine and Crescent Street for shopping and more restaurants; a metro station a couple of blocks down. Overall, everything I wanted to see/do was close to Opus and we rarely took a taxi or public transportation. Cons: The only complaint I have about the room was that it was TOO DARK during the night, with no ceiling lights since their ceilings are made of concrete. Even with two lamps, two bedside table lamps, and a mirror light on, the room was very dark, making it hard to get ready, put on makeup, etc. In retrospect, I am almost certain if I asked for another tall lamp they would have provided it. Also, don't order the breakfast from the hotel. It is extremely overpriced! A simple breakfast with juice will cost one person $22. However, if you walk north of Sherbrooke on St. Laurent you will find a restaurant called Cafeteria that will serve more than what Opus offers for less than $9. To me, Koko was also overpriced; you are paying for the ambience and not the amount of food on your plate. The service was not exceptional here either; expo brought out our food assuming our appetizer plates had been cleared (since they sat empty for 20 minutes) and we also waited a long time for our refills. Go there for drinks - not for dinner. Despite these cons, I would 100% stay at Opus again. The service was exceptional and the location was great!

Our window when closed was very soundproof. We also found an \"O\" umbrella in our closet - which came in very handy. The bath products are great, they use L'Occitane en Provence- very luxurious! Nice white fluffy bathrobes (with a lime green \"O\" -very cute)- huge shower was a nice treat too! The lighting in the room is great - no ceiling lights, but instead, lamps and recessed lighting in one wall behind the bed.

The club blasts club music until 3:30 and you will hear every word, feel every bass note, and generally feel like you're in the club even on floor 5. Even between rooms, expect to hear the neighbors having sex, and everything going on outside on the street.

In such a city which is rich in culinary skill, do not torture yourself by dining at this feeble attempt at gourmet. There was a mistake on our order, and the waiter then charged us to bring out the correct item. When asked to get a manager, he refused to call one. 3. The rooms have terrible lighting. No recessed lighting, and the fixtures are sparce, and the bulbs were burnt out during our stay. 3 days and 2 calls later to front desk for repair, still no lights. 4. Our safe didn't work. 5.

The finishes are very cheap, laminate counter tops on all the furniture, with the dark oak front edgband veneer peeling off in many places. Cheap doors, cheap trim, the bed frame has unfinished MDF showing around as the mattress doesn't cover it completely. Trend forward design gone very bad, think an \"IKEA hotel\", but not as good. 7.

This might be great if you need pitch-dark to sleep, but a bit oppressive for being in the room at other times. I immediately opened all curtains, and that helped, but people could then look right in, from the place across the way, so I had to remember to change in the bathroom or close the curtains! Both times I was in what they call a \"Privilege\" room--that's the smallest. Bed was great--that's important! And chocolate treats at turn-down were a nice touch. The pictures show a bathtub, but neither room I had included one--only a shower, although a spacious one. There is a nice long desk, which was good for working.

The bar tenders were so friendly and ready to serve you whenever you needed a drink. The music was really good. It was that lounging music you want to hear when you are out having a good time. The music wasn't too lound like some bars that you can't even hear yourself think. You can actually have a conversation with the people you are with. Right after a fun evening we headed to our room which was just to die for. Modern, clean and comfortable. I just wanted to stay in there comfy bed all day long. The room was a good size and the bathroom was bigger then the room.(almost) Deep bathtub, huge shower and 2 sinks so I didn't have to fight over it with my husband. Ha! Ha!. We pre ordered our breakfast the night before, but I forgot to write the time I wanted it served to our room. So when I woke up I called reception and they told me I forgot to write a time and they didn't want to call us to wake us up, which I found very respectfull of them. Within minutes our breakfast arrived on a table with flours, fruit, croissants, muffins, juice, coffee and of course my bacon and eggs. The presentation was just beautiful and added to our romatic weekend. All in all I reccommend Opus Montreal to not only couples but to anyone who wants to stay at a really nice hotel and have a good evening at the bar.It also is located in the heart of town town Montreal, which is the place to be.

Having heard of a 100+ room boutique hotel in the downtown area, we thought it was worth a try. What a refreshing experience. From the cool music, chic and smooth lobby, to the well dressed employees, I haven't felt more welcomed in a hotel in years. The room was a little larger than a standard size with dark purples and greys-very different. Black tiles in the bathroom with a glass shower and funky sinks. Every hallway we walked down there was a staff member that smiled. It was within walking distantce-15 minutes to Old Montreal where was a bounty of great restaruants and cafes. Up the street is Sofia's for a great bowl of Goat cheese ravioli and bottle of Vino. A little expensive...but worth it. We went the the hotel restaurant for breakfast which was bright and airy-the server had the sliding doors open to the street. My most pleasant surprise was when we came back to the room both nights and found the room turned down, ice in the buckets, curtains drawn and a treat of chocolates on the pillow. Very welcoming as our feet were sore from walking all day. Didn't find a pool as I dont think they had one. Some planned reno's attachd to the builing are apparently for a banquet hall. I'm glad we went out of our way to try it. Too often we stay at the same chains and are tired of it.

Clearly, those reviewers haven't experienced the Godin firsthand. Service is terrible; the concierge consistently screwed up our dinner reservations, the front desk was alerted about luggage arriving from the airport and we asked them to phone the room when it arrived, but no one ever did. On top of all of that, the Godin's supposed \"pluses\" were conspicously absent. Cool bar? Nope, not open. Restaurant? Closed. Wireless internet? Not in the rooms, and wired internet access available for a hefty $13 a night. The room keys got demagnetized on a regular basis. Not to mention very dark rooms which, even with all the lights turned on, were still dank and depressing (rather than \"trendy\") at night, even during the day. I stayed at the St-Paul just two months prior and for the same price there is no comparison. The St-Paul had a charming staff, which were HELPFUL, not to mention a fully licensed bar and restaurant, beautiful rooms, free internet access, and character missing from the Godin. The Godin had one factor which set it apart from the other boutique hotels in a good way - its location on St-Laurent and Sherbrooke (rather than in the ubiquitous Old Port like every other boutique hotel) made the Plateau, Mile End, Downtown, Old Port and the Village accessible by easy walk.

We decided to come up from New York to check out Montreal. We didn't find the city to our liking (too many depressing buildings and tacky-ness.) The people were blankly nice, but not overwhelming helpful. It seemed as though nobody had any enthusiasm for their own city. This extended to the staff at the Godin. There was no attempt made to help us out in terms of discovering the city. There was no knowledgable concierge on hand to make recommendations. And St. Laurent St.....sad little clubs and gaudy restaurants. not very hip. We bought a bottle of Vodka and holed up on our bed (which is super-comfy) and padded around the nice room. The shower DOES blow though. It's not for tall people and the water pressure is terrible. The room service menu is way overpriced for such a low-rent place. I think it was 24 bucks for a burger. The overall interior design of the hotel is college modern art museum meets new college dorm complex. there is way too much space. no intimacy. aside from a few Ligne Roset lamps in lobby, there is nothing here to shout about. the breakfast room is inversely large in proportion to the selection of food there (no meat, sad little croissants, limited fresh fruit) The exterior of the hotel is pretty joyless as well. Right across from an Esso station. Like an office building. It's not a site to behold and make you think \"great....we are at our hotel\". We stumbled through Jazzfest one day. Such a blight.

Until, that is, I stayed at Le Godin in Montreal, Canada. Besides the trendy lobby, chic rooms and beautiful staff (which I have seen from New York City to Bombay), there was only one very special feature which really made my stay there unforgettable. Only one thing that spoiled me beyond any other hotel I've stayed at. It was the hotel's star concierge, Anna. As I am always travelling to cities for one or two days at a time, nights spent alone eating room service is common practice. When Anna found out that this was my first trip to Montreal and that I was there on my own, she went out of her way to make a full-day itinerary for me, covering day trips to museums and shopping, to the nightlife of eateries and clubs. She explained, and truthfully, that Montreal was a city to be experienced at all hours. She even made sure to call all the places I was visiting ahead of time to let them know that I was coming and to treat her guest exceptionally well. She even passed by to see me during dinner to make sure that my day had gone well. It had, and very well in fact. As soon as I was back home, I booked another trip back to Montreal in 2 months time. Well, was I shocked to learn that upon arrival in Montreal, Anna was no longer working at Le Godin. What's more, her entire position had been eliminated. A concierge was deemed as \"not necessary\" at this chic hotel, where clients expect a high level of service (as confessed by one of the remaining staff). Long gone is the specialized attenton to each customer. Long gone is the much-needed advice and suggestions offered on the beautiful city of Montreal. Long gone are the kind words and pleasant smiles of Anna. It is safe to say that my second trip to Montreal fell far short of my first visit. This second encounter has not soured my taste for Montreal, but the same can't be true for Le Godin. Without Anna, this boutique hotel falls short on all points, especially customer service. The new management, which swept in and eliminated Anna and her position, has buried itself in quick sand. As a travel writer, whose job it is to make recommendations on where to stay in international cities, I am stating to you, as I did to my colleagues, family and friends, save yourself the trouble of bad service and foolish management and don't stay at Le Godin. The Comfort Inn would be a better bet, in my opinion. My mission, since the day I found out that Anna was no longer at this hotel, is to find her and take all my business to her new employer.
