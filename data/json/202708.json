FIRST IMPRESSON: As other have noted, this hotel is in an ideal location for first-time visitors to Venice. Located about a 5-7 minute walk from the S. Marco/S. Zaccaria vaporetto stop, this hotel is about as close as you can get to walking right into your hotel from the water without actually staying in one of the hotels along the shore line. While it IS tucked away in one of Venice's classic narrow streets, there is a sign on the corner of that street with an arrow to follow to the hotel. (From the vaporetto stop, walk through Piazza San Marco keeping to your right, take a right around the basilica and you are there, basically). When you walk in the hotel, you'll notice a particular style that is common to Venetian hotels, I'll call it \"Venetian Yard Sale\". Alot of \"antique\" looking furniture, gold/brass trimmings, carpets and wall paper with designs on them. It's cute and charming (my wife adored it) and I don't mean to make it sound negative. It is NOT dingy or dirty. The service is warm (in fact the service led to one of our best vacation nights ever) and their English is very good (as is the case in all of the popular city hotels of Italy), you need not worry about communicating in broken Italian (though it does go a long way:). Checking in was not a problem. To the left of the reception area is a bar and the dining room where they serve the complimentary breakfast buffet. THE ROOM: I have seen the pics from other reviewers, and I have to say, it looks like we lucked out. Ours was a modest size, but the layout utilized the space well. Again, this was a double \"comfort\" room, so perhaps the rooms are bigger than the singles? They are decorated in the same fashion as the lobby...sort of like being in a doll house. The room was clean and the best was comfortable enough. As for the bathroom, it was small but clean. The views from our room were not interesting as this hotel is landlocked and surrounded by other buildings. YOU WILL NOT SEE CANALS FROM YOUR WINDOWS. If that is important to you, choose another hotel. FOOD: As stated before, this hotel includes breakfast with most of their reservations it seems. And while it is the standard bread/cheese/cold cuts/cereal/coffee-buffet common in Italy, it has proven to be the best of it's kind in all of the hotels I've stayed at in Italy. Also, there is a small bar in the hotel, and while most tourists will probably never use it, we did have a night where my wife and I came back late and the gentleman manning the desk started pouring us massive servings of grappa for free. That was amazing. So it definitely is a perk to have around. Since you are in a central area, there is no shortage of food, though I also suggest walking a ways from the hotel as the nearby establishments are even more tourist-trappy than usual (Venice, frankly, is inundated with bad food, but there are some real great, \"locals-only\" places, you just have to search). MISCELLANEOUS: One thing to remember, you are in the San Marco area, which is the home of many of the major tourist attractions (the Basilica, Campanile, and Doge's Palace). In other words, this place gets CROWDED. Also, if you like to take advantage of off-season traveling like we do, know that this area can also get badly flooded during \"high water\"-season. One major plus: Venice's \"street-sign\" system is aided by numerous signs that point the direction to the major areas like Piazza San Marco (in fact, you can be all the way in the Ghetto and see signs for San Marco). This was great peace of mind for us on our first visit as Venice's many alleys and bridges can take you in circles if you aren't careful. VALUE: This is the real issue with this hotel. We were able to get this room during low season at a great rate. However, just having gone to Venice this last February (2012), I can attest to this hotel sometimes going for upwards of 200euro/night, even more. As I do a random search right now, I'm finding it over 150/night in June. Having been back to Venice and knowing it to some degree, you quickly learn that what you are paying for at this hotel is ease and location. There are MUCH better hotels you can get at a cheaper rate if what you care about is comfort and charm. You just have to look in areas like Dosoduro, Santa Croce, or any of the other neighborhoods. There are even some other Best Westerns in Venice to choose from. FINAL THOUGHTS: Remember, in Venice, you really never are but a short walk from something amazing or picturesque. Therefore, if you are a savvy traveler or don't mind doing a little homework/walking, you will be better served by looking up hotels outside of the Piazza San Marco area. However, if what you need is peace of mind in the knowledge that your kids will be able to find their way back to the hotel, then this hotel is a good choice. Just don't pay over 120euro/night.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFabulous Hotel\u201d", "Author": "BeannieBeans", "ReviewID": "UR127302743", "Content": "We were delighted with our hotel, it was in a very convenient location, easy to find, just behind St Marks Square.

If you want to read in bed, dont try as the bed side wall lamps are not quite bright enough, but there is a handly desk lamp thet is. You are in Venice, so the fact that the TV only has one English channel (CNN) on offer is not a drawback. The room was cleaned daily, comfortably furnished with ample storage for two and even had a mini bar (at a Venetian price). Although there is no restaurant on site there is a small bar and orient express themed breakfast room where an ample continental style breakfast along with several hot dishes are served.

You can never be sure what is set out in any brochure can be relied upon. On this occasion it could. The Montecarlo nestles in a narrow side street approx 100 yds from St Marks square. It has no real frontage. Or pool. Or, comfy lounge. But do not be put off. For a first expereince of Venice this is marvellous. The rooms may not be big. But are very clean & contain all you require for a pleasant stay. Sheets are changed almost every day. And, the rooms are air conditioned. Very desirable. The staff could not be more helpful. The reception managers speak most languges fluently. Always say Good Morning & Evening each time. And, frankly, can handle or arrange any trip you wish. In particular, a free trip to Murano Glass is avaliable at the moment. You are collected from a point near the hotel by power boat & whisked off to see glass blown. And with an opportunity to purchase if you wish. We were waiting for a hard sell. But it did not come. come. Take this offer if you can. Breakfast at the hotel is fine. Pleanty of freshly prepared food. Eg fresh fruit salad, fresh croissants, etc. All replenished regularly. Unlike some places. Breakfats staff could not be more polite & helpful. As were the chambermaids. As long as you intend to spend most of your time away from base - this hotel is outstanding. It does not have views. But you don't really need them. Ask for a room at the back to avoid undue noise. We did not experience any however. It cannot compete with the big hotels overlloking the canal. But that is not what it is about. A warning about Venice. It is the most expensive resort in the world. We likened it to a casino in Las Vegas where you have a handful of euros in one hand continually feeding 'the machine' but never winning. You will get fed up of the waiters enticing you into the nearby restaurants. Almost all the food is the same. If you want anything special it will cost. Beware St Marks square prices! If you sit down at a table with waiter in white jacket there is an immediate supplement of E5.75 per person. Then the cost of drinks which are breathtaking. Two bottles of beer & an orange drink cost E50.00! Everything in Venice comes at a price. Even the WC's -which it has to be said are not plentiful. And cost E1.50 pp. A savings plan in the area of Rialto Bridge is to buy a bottle of water at a restaurant fo approx E4.50 - you can then use their toilet free. Much better. The Vaparetto (Water Bus) is magic. If you are there for a week buy the weekly ticket for E50.00. This seems a lot but isn't. We spent many hours just travelling back & forth on the bus seeing the sights. Often up to 2 hours at a time. Most effective. The sights in the square are superb. But to avoid the queues which run all day - see the Doges & Basilica on separate days & at late afternoon. Much easier. There is also a general 'CHURCHES' ticket you can pick up for E20.00 which gives you access to all the places where normally there wd be charge. Buy one! Montecarlo Hotel greatly recommended. Everyone needs to experience Venice once. You must do so. But we predict you will return home with substantially less cash than when you arrived!

My bed was not very comfortable but my expectations were not high either so it was fine. Room was clean, but did not cool off very well and totally without a view, just rooftops. That was fine, too, because the location more than made up for it. Very close to everything, just a short walk to St. Mark's Square. I guess you should consider all of the above when making a decision about the hotel because now comes the bad experience that ruined it for me. The a.m. clerk was really a jerk. We had asked for a 6 o'clock wake up call and also a water taxi at 6:30. When we got downstairs at 6:10 expecting a cup of coffee and danish, we were told it was not open until 7. Looked totally open with the danish and cereal all laid out and ready to serve, but we understood the 7 a.m. serving thing. Then a vendor delivered a fresh container of fruit, and I asked the clerk if we might have a piece to go. He said no that it was not washed yet? What?? I kept my cool and we sat there in the small lobby until 6:30 waiting for the water taxi. During this time the clerk was not doing anything and we were the only ones around. All of this time I thought we had paid at the time of the booking when I submitted my credit card information. So after 20 minutes of just sitting there, at 6:30 we picked up our suitcases and were ready to leave for the taxi, he told me we had not paid and needed to pay our bill, I handed him the same credit card I always use. He made a swipe and said it did not work so I gave him another one even though I had just used the card the night before and knew perfectly well it worked fine. Again, he said the second card did not work. I told him that one of them needed to since that was all I had, and he asked me \"Do you want me to try swiping in a different machine?\" What? Why would he not have tried that before? I looked at the counter and saw that there were several cc machines and wondered why he didn't do that to begin with. Anway, he did and the card worked fine.

Yes the hotel is showing some signs of the need for an update and redecoration. Our room was number 412, on the top floor with no real view. Some of the wallpaper was peeling, the grouting in the shower needed attention, and the room itself was small. But all of these pail into insignificance when compared with the quality level of service from this family run establishment. The reception team were excellent, the breakfast service was attentive, and we spent some time with the chambermaid as she cleaned up our room (thank you very much, I did feel guilty how we could mess the room up so quickly, so left a handsome tip!!). The room was comfortable, clean and provided all the facilities we required as a tourist. You have to remember this is an old building and as we were advised by the receptionist on our arrival, \"the lift is small and slow, but this is venice\". The massive pluses with the hotel are the attentive quality service (we never had to ask for our room key and received help with a number of questions) and the location, 1 minute from the famous square surrounded by shops and restaurants. This was my fourth and my wife's seventh visit to Venice. This time we decided to walk off the normal tourist areas - in particular Santa Croce, San Polo and Castello. You get to see a truer version of Venice and there are some lovely bars and tavernas here - cheaper than the main tourist areas. Castello around the Arsenal and to the Isola Di S. Elena again offer a real vision of Venetian life. One place you must visit is the clock tower or Torre dell'Orologio - Please do not confuse with the campanile. The Torre dell'Orologio is the clock tower from the 14th century to the left of the Basilica San Marco topped by the statues of two \"Moors\" and a large bell. You can only visit this by reserving a place at the Museo Correr which is at the western end of the Piazza San Marco. The cost is 12 euros each, but this does include entrance to the Museo Correr, which is well worth an hour or two. But a trip up the clock tower is fantastic.

We have just returnedd from our second stay at this hotel (my 7th trip to Venice) and we would not hesitate to recommend it to friends. It is quite literally ONE minute from St Marks Square. Last time we visited (6 years ago) we had our son with us and therefore got a bigger room. I have read reviews on here by whinging Americans who complain about the size of the room - this is not America where everything is huge, this is a 17th century building! When I visit Venice I spend my time walking, seeing the sights and eating in fantastic trattorias ....not sitting in my hotel room grumbling about the size. Another issue that some people on this site have with this hotel is the lack of \"view\" You will not get a view of St Marks Square or the Grand Canal, if you want that pay another few hundred quid a night and stay elsewhere. The view from our room (412) was typically Venetian, lots of rooftops and belltowers. Breakfast is included and has something for everyone. It is good to be able to fill your belly before you set out on mammoth walking expeditions as we did. We found, once again, all staff to be helpful and friendly, especially the two gentlemen who worked reception during our visit. Each time we visit Venice we see something new or visit a different part of the city. This time we took a tour to the top of the clock tower (NOT the bell tower) the one with the the 2 men striking the bell - a great tour and the views from the top were excellent, although I would say the guide got the balance between talking and letting us take photos from the roof a little wrong. We also took a walking tour called \"ghosts and legends\" which was very interesting and took us off the beaten track. Currently there is a lot of restoration work being done which is obviously a good thing, unfortunately lots of the hoardings covering the work were hideous, the bridge of sighs is surrounded by a Coke advertising and a building at the entrance to St Marks Square was covered in Breitling advertising.

I was looking for a hotel that was close to the main sights, easy to get too, and not to expensive. I was also booking 3 rooms for 6 adults, so I was looking to please everyone. We arrived very early in the morning to Venice, we found our hotel right away and although we werent able to check in right away we were able to store our luggage there and wander around for a couple hours while our rooms were cleaned. The staff was extremely helpful and easily answered all of my questions in English. The lobby of the hotel was small (as well as the elevator) but thats too be expected in Venice. There was a free breakfast every morning that most of our group took advantage off and they said it was great. Out of the three rooms, two of the three were very very small. I knew this going in and we personally didn't care as long as they were clean and comfortable. I was in room 302 and it had a full sized bed and a small window, the same as room 307. Just barely enough room for two people but we made it work. The room was very clean, the decor was pretty old though. It was cute and quaint and i'm pretty sure it was made to look that way. The bathroom on the other hand must of just been remodeled because it was very modern and very nice, even though it was small. You could not fit two people in the bathroom at one time. The shower had very good water pressure and hot water. The third room was a lot larger and had a huge full sized bathroom as opposed to the corner shower in rooms 302 and 307. My family in this room had no problems with it and enjoyed their accomodation. The only negative I have about the room is that it was like a sauna in there. The old heater was turned on and it had to have been about 90 degrees in there. Thankfully I was able to find a knob on it to manually turn it off. We could not figure out how to turn the a.c. on but when the window was open a nice breeze would come in. The bathroom did not have a fan to vent the air out so that caused excessive heat. Overall, our stay at the Montecarlo was pleasant and we all enjoyed Venice. The location was fabulous and the staff was very nice.

Oh, and a word about the lift; it must be the smallest I've ever seen - two people side by side or end-on and your luggage - hilarious!! HELPFUL TIP - buy a Venice Connect card; I know that it just seems like yet another expense but if you buy it online beforehand the saving is significant (a 72hr pass online cost 24.75 Euros each, whereas it cost 33 Euros if you buy when you get there) - a single trip on the vaporetto is 6.5 Euros so it's well worth it, also, return bus fare (No 5) from Marco Polo is included, saving 6 Euros per person. Please note that if you want to use the Alilaguna water service to and from the airport, there's an additional charge - however, time-wise, it takes approx an hour whereas the bus takes 20 minutes! If you buy online, take the printout voucher emailed to you to the 'Venice Connect' desk which is situated just inside the main exit to the airport - look for the rainbow painted on the floor!!

Secondly, be aware of the Americans who review this hotel and say the rooms and bathrooms are small. Our room was spacious with high headroom and the bathroom was functional with room to shower, wash and sit on the loo! What else do you want to do in a bathroom?! The room was clean with quality bed linen and traditional Venetian style furniture. The hotel is superbly placed - just a one minute walk from St. Mark's Square. and 10 mins walk from the Rialto Bridge. Yes, it's situated on a VERY narrow street but hey, Mr American, this is Venice and big is not always beautiful! The hotel staff was knowledgeable and helpful and breakfast was plentiful. Being in the middle of the tourist area meant the room was a little noisy with people sounds, but of course, no traffic noise and closing the external shutters as well as the windows cut out most of this. However, it quietened down well before midnight as most tourists bedded down early for the next day's busy sightseeing. Some tips: 1. Avoid Venice in the hot summer months. It's very crowded and the nature of the place does give rise to nasty drainage smells - so they say. We visited in October (our first visit) and the weather was fab. 20 degrees and bright blue skies - and mo smells! 2. Don't be frightened by the absence of vehicular access when finding your hotel. Of course, there are no buses and taxis on the island but getting around is easy. Do your research first and look at the public transport system online to find out how it all works. There are regular water buses which connect with the hire car, rail and bus stations at Piazzale Roma and everyone is helpful and will advise you how to buy your ticket and what line you need to take. Yes, you will have to walk from the waterbus stop through some streets to your hotel, and the streets can be difficult to navigate as they are busy and narrow, so it's easy to lose your sense of direction, but just pop in a shop or bar to ask directions. 3 Consider buying a waterbus multi day pass. The single journey is expensive at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 but if you want to use these buses a lot, a 2 day pass is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac28 and includes the lines that go out to the other islands. The water buses are not always quicker than walking but it can take 20 mins to walk from one side of the Grand Canal to the other, as there are very few bridges, whereas you can cross in 2 mins on a water bus. 4 Restaurants can be expensive but you can also find many reasonably priced pasta and pizza places and there are countless bars and street-food outlets. You can find tourist menus for as little as \u00e2\u201a\u00ac14 or pasta and pizza for under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10. 5 Ask the hotel about the free water taxi ride to the Murano Glass Factory. The factory provides free water taxis and so you can use these to see a little of Venice from the water. It's not a proper water tour like the hotel describes, and be prepared for a hard sell from the glass salesman who will personally escort you around the glass factory. The glass products are amazing but very expensive - their largest chandelier costing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40,000! However, the small jewelry items are OK, starting at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40, and you don't have to buy anything.

Sure enough it did eventually stop leaking, but we had to use the garbage can and all our towels to soak it up. The next morning, the front desk was very helpful and apologetic and allowed us extra time in the room if we needed it, even though we were checking out that day, but it was promptly fixed. Breakfast was very good, with choice of great scrambled eggs, breads and fruit. Located in the heart of shopping, it was great. Be aware of the Murano tours...and decline if asked.

As far as the general look of the hotel and its d\u00c3\u00a9cor - it was very nice. We stayed in a triple room that was actually a double with a strange cot-like bed that my friend had to sleep in. She says she found it comfortable but did have some problems with her back because of it. The gentleman on reception during the day was wonderful - polite, friendly and even remembering our room number each and every time we went to get our key. However the gentleman on during the night was very rude indeed. Many times he would respond to us asking for our key by slamming it on the counter. One night the gentleman on the day reception was still there chatting to the night man when he saw us enter the hotel, on asking for our key he said jokingly to the night receptionist 'How could you forget these ladies are in room 107?', to which the night receptionist replied ' To me they are just clients'! We were very offended indeed. Then when we were leaving he spent ages printing our bill and counting the cash we had given him, he also didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother to hold the door open for us after we had tipped him 5 euros! Incredible! The hotel itself is in brilliant location, not just for St Marks Square, but also for all areas of Venice. San Polo and Santa Croche are accessible via the Rialto Bridge, which is about 5 mins walk from the hotel. Note a piece of advice about anyone purchasing a 'Rolling Venice' card - these cards are good for the civic museums, but wont get you in the Accademia Gallery. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t told this when we bought them, which was very annoying. The tickets cost 22 euros but that price is worth it just for Doge's Palace alone. If you can, go on the Secret Itineraries tour to view Casanova\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s jail cell - we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this and wished we had! All in all Venice is a wonderful place, not only did we have a wonderful time but we also had the advantage of watching the Italians win the world cup, while standing in a beautiful square in San Polo! Once in a lifetime experience. Finally, despite its expense, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth going to Harry's Bar for a Bellini.

Very friendly, very accommodating and very helpful. For me, that's all I could ask for in a foreign land. The hotel is close to St. Marks, and about 5 minutes from the Rialto Bridge (main tourist shopping). Venice is not a big place to begin with, so as good as the location is relative to those two points, if you don't mind walking - which is all you do in Venice - location really isn't high on my evaluation list. The main part of the room was very good. High ceilings, nice lighting fixture, big window that looked out to the alley below. The bathroom was on the smaller side. There was one item of contention - the shower curtain - which would literally attack you while showering...in our room the shower stall was like a box on the floor enclosed by a vinyl shower curtain that if the wind blew the right way, for whatever reason, you would be encased in shower curtain...stuck to you...kinda gross while trying to get clean, but none the less we worked through it. And this certainly did not affect the way we felt overall about the hotel. The breakfast was fine. All the standards. The Staff. When we arrived - after taking an over night train from Paris to Venice and the #82 water bus to the St Marks landing, then walking our luggage through the hustle and bustle of St. Marks...we found the Best Western Montecarlo. Oh, I must add that there are street signs that CLEARLY mark where the hotel is located - which was a plus. We were greeted by a much needed smile. Forget his name - taller, skinny guy with very short hair - super nice, very informative, very friendly, spoke English very well. Made all the difference in the world after our adventure trying to get there. Each front desk person was very helpful when we would ask for non-touristy dinner spots...and, although we didn't have a chance to use this feature, I am pretty sure the Hotel offers free transportation to Murano - don't quote me on that, inquire with your very friendly front desk person. Venice is a wonderful place...arguably one of the most special places on the planet...and the Best Western Montecarlo was key in our experience.

Generally you definitely get more than your money's worth with this one.", "Date": "May 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmond, OK", "Title": "\u201cFavorite hotel in Italy.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3500963", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Montecarlo in September of 2004.

The breakfast room is too small for the number of rooms and we had to queue each morning to be seated, but contrary to other reviews, there was no shortage of food and it was all replenished. However, it is a little boring and some variety with the hot food would be good. Staff were friendly and reception staff spoke excellent English. We didn't take the free boat trip to Morano (having been scared off by some reviews) but heard 2 sets of guests complaining (separately - different days) to the management about being pressurised to buy glass on Morano, one couple saying that staff on the island wouldn't let them board the return boat because they hadn't bought, and another woman complaining that the trip was too long, taking up too much of the day. Apparently there is an arrangement that hotel guests get a 10% discount on meals in the restaurant next door, but the staff didn't inform us of this, nor did they tell us about the regatta on the Grand Canal on Sunday. Having said all that, we would definitely use this hotel again.

October is very nice in Venice, although we did not expect so much flooding, which was quite bad. Can't believe how busy it was for this time of year. The Hotel is great. The best thing is its situation. We could see the Campanile out of our window. Very convenient for St. Mark's Square, the Rialto and loads of shops and restaurants. It's nice and quite except when the bells chime at 7.00am and the flood alarm goes off some mornings. It's a nicely decorated, clean Hotel, and the staff speak perfect English and are very pleasant. The Restaurant only serves breakfasts at this time of year but these aren't too bad, although a bit more variety wouldn't go amiss. Service is good. We had some very expensive, ordinary meals in the local tourist area. It's best to keep to the set menues if you want to eat nearby. However, if you look look further afield, the food can be very good and reasonable. Part of the fun is going out in the evening looking for somewhere to eat. There's no shortage of places. Coffee's quite expensive in the bars and its usually cheaper to have the local beer, which is very good. Had to have a cocktail in Harry's Bar. It's a disappointing place as far as decor goes, but it's strong on atmosphere. Expect to pay about 13-14 Euros for a cocktail if you sit at the bar, but the service is excellent.
