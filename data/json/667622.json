Boy was I disappointed. It is not a dive--but it is just a hair above. There were big smudge marks on the walls of out room, and the tile floor was not really well cleaned; the air conditioner barely worked; there were no instructions for the TV, and the station guide did not match the stations; no one answers when you call the desk from your room...so you have to walk down stairs if you want something like a wake up call. On the good side, it was relatively quite, nd the sheets were clean. The pictures of nude women on the walls of the hall kind of makes you wonder if they might not rent the rooms by the hour... not my cup of tea. And, don;t be fooled by the 'rooms have a view' notes, most don't..indeed our room looked out to an air shaft. You have to pay extra fro internet service--and it is pretty slow. For $100 Euros you can do much better.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramsgate", "Title": "\u201cThis is the hotel to stay in\u201d", "Author": "terrytraveler13", "ReviewID": "UR109856442", "Content": "My wife and myself have recently returned from a visit to Rome where we stayed in this hotel. The hotel is on the seafront and about 30 mins from the city. The hotel was very clean, the staff were very helpful and all reception staff spoke English. The waitresess in the breakfast room spoke a little English but it was enough to understand. Breakfasts were a good continental buffet' from 06.00 - 10.00hrs. Half board can be arranged prior to arrival and the evening meal is served at a restaurant across the road on the beach. The restaurant bills the hotel at a set price but the food is excellent, and the staff are very friendly but speak very little English. The one small fault we found was the pillows are very thin and as we had been forwarned we took inflatable pillows but there was one extra good pillow and we did not worry about asking for another one as we had our inflatable ones. The beds were very good. Clean towels every day but they were linen and not towelling although they were just as good for drying. Free safe in rooms for which you set your own security number. To go into Rome the station is about 10mins walk and it is best to buy a 4euro ticket which lasts until 23.59hrs and can be used on any bus,tram or train in the urban district of Rome as many times as you wish all day. Ostia Antica is two stops up the line and is well worth a visit but needs a good day to see all, it is like Pompei but not covered in ash. There are plenty of shops about with a Carrefore near the station. In all we found this hotel good in all respects. Although there is a bar next door the noise was not bad enough to worry us. We found this a very agreable hotel and place to stay.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Qu\u00e9bec", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for last night in Italy\u201d", "Author": "chagallvoyage", "ReviewID": "UR109840625", "Content": "This was our last night in Italy, this hotel provides a Shuttle to the airport for 6 euros, which was great and efficient. The room are fine, clean and yes it is a 3 star hotel so you can't expect the Ritz but I've seen much worse 3 stars in Europe and USA. The rooms on the 3rd floor are better as the floors are ceramic tiles, you can hear people walking above you (a little). Also, there are 2 nice terraces for guests located on the 3rd floor. Take advantage of the breakfast in the morning, especially the coffee, made by a nice girl. No they do not serve eggs and bacon but this is Italy so Croissants and coffee, yogourt, juices...

Furthermore, \"how to reach?\" directions listed on the site are not sufficient and I took a risk to reach the hotel from Rome's Fuimucino Airport.

It was a great contrast to the hustle and bustle of tourist Rome and the 'Eat and Go' restaurant across from the hotel was great value. The hotel has seen brighter days (it was built in the hey day of Italian 'Hollywood') but is in a great location in the centre of the seafront. I had read the reviews but said to my partner 'as long as the rooms were clean, I'd be happy'; and they were. Big enough, double glazed patio door which helped to keep the little bit of street noise out and clean throughout, I was happy. The towels were a bit thin but I didn't mind as I had my own. The shower was very small indeed but again 'did what it said on the tin'. The staff on reception were friendly enough and the rooms had free wi-fi albeit intermittent. We stopped for five nights and I can honestly say that so long as you're not expecting the Hilton, this hotel is a perfect bargain and suitably comfortable. It's a five minute walk to the station and hey, you're in Rome! The hotel is just somewhere to lay your head and get a shower.
