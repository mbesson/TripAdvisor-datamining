Breakfast on Monday was excellent and something for everybody. The second nights meal was in the Pub. This was very good and was simple fresh and tasty. It's worth a trip to the rooftop bar to enjoy the view. All in all i would recommend this hotel. If you dont want to use a taxi into town turn left out of the hotel and walk ~200m.

Staff at the lobby Ok, business like not really warm and friendly. A tour desk was open late at night which we immediately booked an entire day trip of Istanbul which turned out to be quite good and covered the Hagia Sophia, Blue mosque, roman forum, Turkish museum, lunch, suleyman mosque and the topkapi palace and the market. Of course, what city tour would not be complete without the waste of time in a shop trying to share you their wares which one would usually expect from a booked city tour - in Istanbul it is carpets. But overall, the basics were covered in just the one free day we had. The location was a bit far from the tourism side of istanbul- a long taxi ride away and from 3 or 4 taxi rides I experience, istanbul taxi drivers do try to talk to you about the sites and seem to be kind but don't speak a word of English. All however are reckless and you tend to hold on whatever handle your hands can hold on to. Also, there are quite a few hotels in Istanbul were there is a Plaza in the name, this one is just plainly The Plaza hotel. Be sure to specify the address - Barbaros Boulevard. Room had a nice view of the Bosporus bridge connecting asia with europe. Meals at the hotel restaurant was fair. You get to taste the local dishes and just about every possible way eggs can be cooked. nice cheese platter and a taste of raki. Meat dishes were quite limited, at least during the 3 or so meals i had there. A convenience store is located a few meters towards the right after you exit the hotel, located near a petrol station. Business/meeting rooms and service are satisfactory. Overall, the hotel is satisfactory although not top notch.
