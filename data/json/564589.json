I never got in the pool but I did use the hot tub on several occasions and it was a little cool for my liking, but was still comfortable. Breakfast was amazing for a free continental breakfast with waffles, sausage, eggs, biscuits and gravy and a large assortment of pastries, baked goods, cereals and fruit. My only complaint was that the WIFI was a little slow. I tried all of the available networks in the hotel and could never get a good fast connection.

I said that I didnt have the extra money to give for a deposit. As new customers came into the lobby, the manager came over and said that if I gave them $40 cash that would be accepted. It hurt my wallet to do that but I really had no other choice since all of the other hotels we looked at were book up. Then the manager said that he could take the $40 cash and apply it to my bill so that the deposit would go back onto my card in 5 days. I told him that was unacceptable and then he rudely told me that I could get it back after I check out but he would have to hand write a receipt. I told him thats whats he's gonna do if he wants our business because I cant afford to wait for $40 to go back to my card. He appologized to the new customers behind us for the wait but didnt say anything to me and my husband. I didnt want the hassel of looking for another place since we were there so we just stuck it out. The beds were lumpy and the pillows were way too soft and flat. Plus my husband had to go down to the front desk to ask for shampoo, conditioner and soap because the non-english speaking housekeeper did not stock the bathroom.

At one point 12 kids, including our two, were in the pool and there was still plenty of room for more to have joined. At 10pm the hotel asks that the kids leave the pool so that adults can enjoy the indoor pool/hot tub area in a kid free environment. At first I was put off a little since our kids are too young to leave alone, but the husband side of me can see how nice and relaxing that could be. I'll enjoy that in a couple years when we stay there. The staff from the desk to the breakfast area are very friendly and helpful. Free cookies and USA Today in the lobby is nice, as are the red apples they have out there in the mornings. Breakfast was awesome. Waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, bagels, muffins, toast, boiled eggs, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, juices, coffee and milk were all available this past weekend while we were there. The location is right off of I-465 on the southwest side of Indianapolis. For those not from Indianapolis, I-465 makes a big circle around the outer edge of Indy. You can't get lost. There are plenty of exits on I465 to get you to shopping, sports and other places.

It was 80F inside and 30F outside. We could open a window, but since the highway on-ramp was 50 yards from the room, the noise was unbelievable. The next morning, we requested a room change and were told they were filled, but they would look into fixing everything in the room. The housekeeping supervisor intervened (Bless Her) and upgraded us to a suite. We've never had so many problems in one room. The rest of the stay was quite nice. The hotel was clean and well maintained (except for the first room). The suite had 2 queen beds, plus a small sitting area. It was on the even room number side, so noise was negligible. The pool was clean, but very cold the first night. It got progressively warmer each additional night, so kids were increasingly happy. Breakfast was well stocked and very good with the typical Country Inn fare. Bottom line is request an even numbered room if you think traffic noise will be a problem.

I am guessing that some how the wind forced the rain in then unit, then dripped on the carpeting. Room to room noise, along with hallway noise, was minimal. But this side of the hotel is right next to the interstate on and off ramp, so semi noise was very noticeable. As always in hotels, we wear earplugs, so it was manageable. But I think this could be a big concern for most people. The heater worked great and was very quiet. The tv worked fine. The front desk area and breakfast room is very nice looking. The breakfast was very much above average and satisfying. Waffles and a couple other hot items were available, along with plenty of other items. The lady working the breakfast area worked her butt off all days and kept everything in order and well stocked. There are 2 restaurants in sight of the hotel. The Brickhouse restaurant and Culvers.

Last year, I got the Hyatt Place ($34.00) and this year the Country Suites and Inn ($40.00). The Holiday Inn Select also comes up at these prices. So right off the bat, great value. Other pros of this location include: Excellent workout room with nice cardio machines, free weights and a Bowflex. Clean indoor pool and hot tub. Decent breakfast with frozen omelettes, cereal, pastries etc. Free internet, including two stand alone computers for guests. And one exceptional front desk clerk (Joey Baker) Negatives: I had requested a room with two double beds. I know that with Priceline especially, it is just that; a request. However, I telephoned the day before and was assured that I had two double beds. This was important to me since I was sharing the room with a straight buddy (more important to him I guess) When I arrived at the hotel there was a guest at the counter who was requesting a king bed instead of the two doubles that he and his wife had received. The clerk was in the process of telling him the hotel was full and there could be no room exchanges. I quickly verified that I had two double beds, and lo and behold I had one king bed. Fortunately, they allowed us to switch rooms but it took 15 minutes to do so. This will lead me to the one negative of this location; the front desk staff. As great as Joey was ( I will explain more) we had three separate incidents where the staff fell down on the job. And this is where the Number Two rating in Trip Advisor fails. Service is paramount in a hotel and for this location (though with many positives) to be ranked #2 is cockeyed. The Hyatt Place I stayed at last year was much superior. So take these ratings for what they are, and read the reviews; I believe you will get a much better picture. But now on to the staff. One of the reasons it took 15 minutes to switch our rooms, was that the other clerk (not Joey) did not remember how to check someone in. Yes, we were all new once, and this clerk was brand new, but come on, when's the last time a clerk didn't know how to check a guest in? The next day, I stopped at the front desk to ask a question and a different clerk was talking with their manager (on the phone) about some customer that refused to give their credit card information over the phone. The conversation went on for at least 10 minutes and the clerk ignored me the whole time. Finally, a second clerk (the one who didn't know how to check someone in) came out and gave me the wrong information concerning the shuttle to the airport. Fortunately, since I was leery of the info, we later checked and obtained the accurate information. Anyway, back to Joey. Not only was he able to switch rooms (between the king and the two queens) so to speak..., he later switched us again to a room not facing the freeway. So, when you book this hotel request an EVEN number room as these are the ones that face the quiet front of the hotel. So hats off to Joey Baker; thanks! I gave this hotel a four star rating based on value (on Priceline) and certain amenities, but hopefully their front desk personnel get some better training soon. Cheers.

We decided at that point we would not be using the pool or hot tub. We were very exhausted and tried to go to sleep early. We were on the fourth floor. There were children running up and down the hallways, shouting, jumping, making all kinds of noise. After several hours of this, I couldn't take it any longer. It was after 10p.m. I had to call the front desk who said they would send security up. We overheard the security officer tell a child that it was at least the second time he had caught the kid in the hallway and wanted to know where the mother was at. I assume he took care of the problem; however, we should not have had to endure this for any length of time. In addition, we were in a non-smoking room; however, a few doors down were smoking rooms. The smoke smell from those rooms filled the hallways and we could smell it in our room. Ask if the floor you are on has smoking and non/smoking rooms on the same floor! This was awful. Also, the beds and furniture are all HARD. The next morning, we noticed that there was a sign on the pool door stating it was closed. We heard from others talking that someone had left a present in the pool and in the hot tub and both had to be cleaned. YUK!!! Am I glad that I did not let my children go into the pool.

Main draws are the cleanliness and the accommodating staff. We love to stay at well-managed hotels because every aspect of the hotel makes for a pleasant stay. (Think about the hotels that work efficiently in the way that the employees are empowered to take care of running the hotel as if they were staying as a guest, maintenance in order as preventative routine instead of resulting from complaint, or employees seeking out issues before they turn into problems, for example.) FACTS: -Room is clean where you would expect it to be clean and clean in those \"behind\" or \"under\" places, as well. Floor in bathroom is cleaned all over and not only cleaned in the more traveled area; tub/shower and sink are also well taken care of. -No sign of mold/mildew on any part of the bathroom. -Sheets, pillows, covers, and bed not stained. Fresh smell on all bedding. -Breakfast is complimentary. Waffle iron is the only noticeable hot food until you see the cheese omelettes and sausage links in the window-front refrigerator for guest microwaving as needed. Well-stocked in other breakfast food areas, too. -24-hr airport shuttle availability makes for easy transportation to and from the airport (make them aware of your arrival/departure schedules) OPINIONS: -Oftentimes see hotels that have the lobby is well-maintained but not the rooms. This hotel has the rooms maintained as they should be. They truly must be looking out for their guests. YEA!! -Breakfast has many choices, yet could even be more inviting if hot foods were all presented without having to warm up the eggs/sausage ourselves. This is a VERY minor issue, however. We would rather heat up our own eggs than put up with a mediocre hotel. This hotel was tops. For us, pre-warmed eggs/sausage didn't seem to matter one iota in this comparison. -The people at this hotel make the difference. Since you have a choice where you stay (and pay a lot of money each night) stay where the people who work there make the difference!
