The following morning I woke up @ 3am and could not take it anymore. I packed my bags and when I walked out of the room there was a dog peeing on the hallway carpet!!!!!! The dogs owner said not to worry - that she would clean it up---- while holding a bath towel. There was no shampoo in the bathroom - you have to purchase it through a vending machine. The rooms are not cleaned while you are there. People are living there full time and there is no security. Very unsafe conditions and a clear health hazard!!!!!!!

The front desk clerk was friendly but in a hurry to get back to her friends. When we got to the room we noticed that the door was open, it looked as though someone had tried to pry the door open at some point. Mu husband pushed on the door and assured me it wouldn't open if locked. The hallways were terribly lit and the wallpaper was falling off of the walls. Upon entering the room it was clear that the room had not been cleaned in quite some time. There was a white powdered substance all over the back of the doors and locks, I immediately cleaned it off because I was unsure of what it was, the floors were covered in a layer of dust which was unsafe for me due to my asthma, the fuse box wouldn't close leaving the fuses exposed, the outlet covers were falling off of the wall, the closet doors were full length mirrors that were cracked and broken in half, the television was broken, the toilet didn't flush, there was a film on the back of the headboard, I could go on and on about the condition of the room... We stayed there for about 2 1/2 hours until we found another hotel. As we were leaving there was 3 guys screaming through the lobby door to let us in which we did not as we felt very uncomfortable. When we took our luggage to the car we realized that the back door to the hotel did not close or lock which is very unsafe. When we walked out the dimly lit parking lot, one of the men from the lobby was looking in our car windows!! The \"manager\" followed us out to our car and asked us why were leaving after 3 hours, we made something up about our dog to avoid confrontation and got out of there!! We ended up spending the rest of our trip at a La Quinta that I would recommend to anyone!!", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moulton, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cMy first time at this hotel, it won't be my last.\u201d", "Author": "Klyde27", "ReviewID": "UR88138029", "Content": "This was my first stay at a Homestead Suite Hotel, I was impressed by the comfort provided for the lower cost.

The check in was fast and there were no problems. The room was right next to the elevator which was very nice. The room was also a corner room, so it was very spacious. The room was very nice and very clean. I have stayed at many extended stay hotels before and In my opinion Homestead Suites is a step up from other extended stay hotels. What I really liked: *I felt very safe *Nice and friendly hotel staff. *Open and inviting lobby. *Large bathroom counter and sink. *Lots of space for clothing and cabinets for food. *Even though the hotel is near the airport I never heard noise from a Plane. *Over all the room was very nice and comfortable. Problems: *Room key kept deactivating. *Glass sliding doors to the closet were loose, and one door came completely off the track. *When I payed for Internet, the desk did not give me the pass code the first time. *The shower curtain was a very thin fabric and there was not a plastic shower liner. *The toilet paper holder was almost broken on one side. *There were cobwebs in two of corners of the walls in the room. *One night the person working had a dog with her, and the dog followed me to the elevator.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGoing to the airport?

Staying at the Homestead Studio Suites will haunt you long after you've been treated for a communicable disease or two. I believe the poor soul who coined the term 'fleabag' must have spent a night at this wretched establishment. If you've ever wanted to know what it would be like to live in a bomb shelter in Afghanistan, this is the place for you. I defy anyone to find a worse place to stay in the United States. Flithy old carpet, both on the floor and walls, a bathroom which leaves only those with a strong stomach to take a shower, and if you are fortunate, a decrepit air conditioner to blow biohazard air directly on you. But hey, at least the bugs that infest the place are less active if you turn your tiny closet of a room into an icebox.

First of all, this place was in the middle of an office park, with no clear way to get there. The business park had street signs with no words on them. About five u-turns and 30 mins after we got off of the interstate, we finally found it. The staff was super friendly, however there was no shampoo/conditioner (staff told us they were out), and there was only one paper-thin pillow (staff said there weren't any available). The mattress was small, and felt like a trampoline. My husband, being a nice guy, let me have the piece of paper pillow, which apparently didn't help because we both woke with sore necks and headaches. The rooms were huge, but old and dirty.
