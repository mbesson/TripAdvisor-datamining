The room I have booked is a Studio apartment. It is understandably small as it is on a prime location. Accessibility is convenient and not difficult to locate. However, it may be challenging to get a taxi as it is a deadend road and not many cabs are seen turning into the lane, nevertheless public transport e.g. buses and mtr station is in the vincinity of the hotel. Fridays and Saturdays evening can be a little rowdy as the more crowds were seen at the pubs/ restaurants. No issue with the speed of the lift (not extremely slow but just got to be a little patient). The shower is strong and powerful though the shower area is small. Generally the room is clean but the location of the air-con in the room is badly situated and it can be rather stuffy when you are lying on the bed as the air-con does not blow towards the direction of the bed. During my stay, two ceiling lights was burnt out so it was a little dim at night but sufficient lument to get by things. The corridors are not air-conditioned and it is very warm (not stuffy) when you have been waiting a little longer for the lift just outside your room. I also note that there is a big metal cabinet on wheels meant for collection of soiled towel near one of the emergency exit at the 10 floor. This is a potential fire hazard, for the safety of your guset please do not leave the cabinet although there are two doors that lead to the same staircase. One feedback I would like the hotel to note is that, the quality of pillows is very important to your guest, do not provide flat pillows that are of no support to the neck. I had a stiff neck after the first night and subsequently felt better after requesting for extra pillows. The service of the bistro at Level 3 is lukewarm, well the feeling i have is you get what you paid for. Front-desk service was so-so , of course you do not expect service of a 5-start hotel as the price you paid for is what you will expect, especially when the apartment is located on a prime land. On the whole, I may recommend the hotel to my friends or return for my next stay and hope to see an improve in the quality of pillows provided! :-)", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cLocated in the heart of everything\u201d", "Author": "anggingyin", "ReviewID": "UR134482722", "Content": "Citadines Ashley has always been my choice of stay due to the superb location.

I have no time to eat anyway, but I believe that the restaurant is very small as it is only 3 rooms in my floor. There are many restaurants on Ashley road and nearby. In conclusion, if you have limited budget, but in need of great location - just go for it. It is a lot cheaper than Langham, Kowloon hotel, or Marcopolo nearby.

For 2 people it was fine. It was what was called a studio. . Very clean and modern with a nice tiled floor. A large mirrored wardrobe with plenty of clothes hangers, plenty of shelf space and 2 good sized drawers. A safe in the apartment was great too. My only disappointment was that there were no easy chairs to sit on. There was 1 office type chair at the glass topped desk, where the internet connection was but it meant if 2 people were sharing the apartment only 1 got a seat, the other had to sit on the bed. There was a nice little space with a sink, one burner electric hob, fridge, microwave and kettle....quite adequate. Another thing I liked was that the window actually opened, and not just an inch or so but wide enough to get some air into the place. The shower room / toilet had a nice big shower space with a good pressure shower and plenty of hot water all day and evening, it never let us down. The toilet itself was spotlessly clean with a soft closing lid / seat. Towels and toileteries were replaced / replenished daily. The wash hand basin / vanity unit was separate. ( just outside the shower room door. There was a modern wall mounted TV with various international channels and an iron and ironing board also. For us the large roomy bed had quite a hard mattress, but the bed linen was lovely....very good quality and beautifully silky smooth cotton. All in all it was a good place to stay being so handy to all Tsim Sha Tsui has to offer. Plenty of eateries in Ashley Road The 2 lifts are both clean, smell nice, work well and are not slow as previous posts have indicated. No member of the public can use the lifts as they are card operated and only residents have a card ( given at check in )...good security.

Citadines is wonderfully located to explore the many aspects of Kowloon and the Island of Hong Kong. In addition, it is surrounded by convenience shops, restaurants and bars. Within a few minutes walk there is a supermarket, the MTR, buses and the Star Ferry terminal. The view from the rooms appears to be decreasing as new tall buildings go up. Unfortunately, the price of room has noticeably increased over the past few years and some areas are beginning to look a bit shabby. The Studio Executive apartments on the top most floors suffer from a support half way in the windows that restricts movement from that side of the bed, but it is not impossible to pass. However, we preferred the Studio Executive apartments because of walk in shower as opposed to a bath. We found the size of the room and ample storage was adequate for 2 people. The apartments are basically equipped for cooking with a small hob, and a microwave. Washing up of utensils and crockery is done with the daily service. There is also satellite television with stations in English though when we arrived BBC World had to be reinstated and we did lose CNN at some stage.

After a reservation stuff up (not ours) we had to split our 2 night stay between two different rooms. The 1st , a studio apartment which could best be described as shabby with tatty furniture, dysfunctional doors and lights, difficult toilet, broken thermostat on the AC and generally in need of serious TLC. A lack of kitchen ware (only 1 bowl) made the kitchenette facility close to useless. Our second room was close to microscopic with very little room around the bed, you pretty much had to climb on from the end. Though not quite as tatty as the 1st, still far from good or acceptable. Both beds were truly an example of man\u2019s inhumanity to man, the mattresses, I use the term loosely, were the hardest I\u2019ve ever experienced. I had to keep on checking they were real and not blocks of wood, they looked real but real sleep was simply impossible on these excuses for comfort. I\u2019ve done a reasonable amount of travel/backpacking around Asia for over 25 years and never experienced beds like these. Shame Citadines, shame! There also appeared to be some serious night club action happening relatively close by which the Citadine is ill equipped to acoustically handle. Maybe this explains the beds, you\u2019re not going to sleep anyway so why bother trying. Our 2 day HK homeward stop over was meant to be a little touch of luxury after nearly 6 weeks of backpacking in Europe but the Citadines totally spoiled this for us, the only real dud for the entire 6 weeks of travel so I suppose I can\u2019t complain too much, but yes I will.

Our first impression was good (clean and uncluttered and modern)but the bathroom needed repair (for a one year old serviced apartment) - the shower curtain smelt mouldy, the toilet seat was spoilt, and the shower stand was broken, but worst was the shower turning really hot and really cold on its own. The second check-in was 30 March to 5 April for 6 days of a dirty smelly room (room 2001) and erratic hot and cold showers again. This room was dusty, walls full of markings, bedhead and lamps dusty and cupboards and curtains even worse. After the first night, I asked for the studio to be thoroughly cleaned and the smelly shower curtain to be replaced- yes, they only cleaned the floor, replaced the shower curtain and left everything uncleaned and dusty. Subsequently we spent as little time as possible in the room. Increasing negatives were unstable broadband - you can't connect in the morning (so what if Citadines had free broadband if you can't use it). The ironing board shud be replaced with a sturdy one with a proper padded board (it was so thin that our ironed clothes had grill lines on it). Everyday when we returned to the room, it smelt of sewer and will disappear when the fans and aircon are turned back on. At any one time, there is only one staff at the reception counter - the ladies are friendlier altho obviously lonely. The male receptionist was entertained by his computer oblivious to anyone walking in or out. The lobby is non-existent - it is just a service counter - this Citadine is not true t its European heritage which is normally well-located, small, chic, clean and efficient and normally, they do have a proper lobby.

HK style dim sum restaurants, HK style tea and coffee houses, International food places, 24 hr convenience stores. They are all around the place of Citadines Ashley. Also shopping at Harbour CIty & i-Square is within 10 minutes walking distance. More importantly, the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station is also 10 minutes walk away. Secondly, though the rooms are pretty small, but all HK rooms are pretty small (I stayed in the standard studio rooms for 2), they felt comfortable and at ease. Great for just sleeping after a long day of shopping! Pretty well kept room as well everyday. Clean and Tidy! Kitchen utensils were pretty useful as well if one needs to pack food to your room! Last but not least, the most value added part of this place is the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. My aunt injured her hand on one of our trips to nearby Macau and when we checked with the Citadines staff, she recommeded us to St Teresa Hospital for a more accurate and thorough examination of the injury, rather than to some untrustworthy street side Medical stall. Also, another of the staff assisted my aunt with some traditional treatment with Chinese ointment and helped to bandaged the injured part. It definitely helped to bring the swell in the injury down.

Location is very good, very near Tsim Sha Tsui MTR, all the various sightseeing locations/activities (Star Ferry Terminal, Clock Tower, Ave of Stars, etc), food and shopping all within the area. You can shop all the way from TST to Mongkok via Nathan Road. Another thing to note is airport transfer service. This does not come free and has to be booked via your own means as hotels in Hong Kong usually do not provide this service. We went for Vigor airport transfer and dropoff at Langham Hotel (or Kowloon Hotel if you prefer).

It had a flat screen tv & DVD player which could slide between the bedroom & lounge and a full kitchen. Bathroom was also very spacious as it was wheelchair accessible. For our last 3 nights were were in a Studio Apartment (Room 901) which was still spacious but all in the one room. For our last night we were upgraded to an Executive Apartment (Room 1902) - this was my favourite as it was on a high level and had views across to Hong Kong Island.

Right in the middle of Tsim Sha Tsui, surrounded by shops and restaurants. It is no more than a 2 minute walk to Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station (on Nathan Road), which will take you anywhere you need to go in the city. It cost about 4HKD to get to Mong Kok for shopping and about 10HKD to get to central. It's close to Kowloon park which is a real contrast to the city hustle and bustle. It is about 10-15 minutes walk to Temple street which has a really good night market. In the other direction its only 5 minutes to the Star ferry crossing which gives the most awesome views across the harbour.

I don't know about the other floors, but on our floor, there are two rooms. So my guess is that there are two rooms on every floor. The location of the hotel is perfect. It's only a few minutes walk from the TST train station, maybe 5 minutes max. It is also not far from the harbor, I would say it's a 10 minute walk from the hotel. There are many places to eat and shop near the hotel. The only negative comment I have about this hotel is the bed. The bed is the hardest bed I've ever slept on. It's like sleeping on a rock, seriously. It took about a night to get use to the hard bed, after the first night, I came to accept it. You get free WIRED high speed internet, so that's a major plus. The view from the room isn't the best, but we're not in Hong Kong to get a great view from our room :-) Overall, I would stay at this hotel again.

It was a really good experience. It took me a long time to deceide, as we are 2 adults, 1 4yr old child and 1 baby. Most hotels would not accept an extra bed, plus a babycot, in the standard and deluxe rooms. These apartments did. It was not very spacious, as the sofabed was left open all day, plus the babycot and the queen size bed, but it had enough space for the kids to play around in. Everything was very clean, new and modern. There was no breakfast included and no resturant in the building, but it has a small kitchenette and I made breakfast for the kids and then went for coffee at Starbucks nearby. The sofabed was very comfortable and could fit 2 children, the queenbed was also very comfortable. There was a sliding door between the \"bedroom\" and the living area that could be completly closed, we could not use it in the day, because then it became too small, but at night it gave that extra bit of privacy. It was very cold at night, and they gave us a little heater, so it was fine. The bathroom is small, but has eveything, the showerhead was really nice with very hot water all the time. They supply basic toilettries like showergel, shampoo, soap and toothbrush. They have a hairdryer too. The TV was big and good, but few channels to choose from, however they have a DVD player, and can be moved from the room to the living area. The kitchen is very basic with toaster, microwave, fridge, kettle and a two place stove. They have a small safe in the closet. When the sofabed is opened you have to remove the small table for eating, so that was not so good, but you can still sit at the desk and eat. We stayed out all day and just came back for a short rest in the late afternoon, before setting out for dinner. So even though the space is small, it was comfortable and well kept. They have closet space for hanging, plenty of shelves and two drawers, you have to pack everything away before moving around....you can't have an open suitcase on the floor with the sofabed opened !!!!
