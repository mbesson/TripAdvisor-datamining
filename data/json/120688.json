Our lanai used to have plants on it but now just dirt and cigarette butts cover the space. Bathroom was large and kitchen was adequate.

Resort has a restaurant, grill bar, pizza area, etc. Also has an activity center for the kids. Sit on the beach and watch the whales from Nov - April. We had a one bedroom suite. While everyone would like an ocean view or ocean front our room faced the mountains which was a very nice view. The rooms are very large. Very comfortable king bed, in living room there is a nice sized sleeper sofa, bathroom has a separate shower and tub and two separate sinks. Kitchen area has a microwave, dishwasher, full refrigerator. Refrigerator had no ice maker or ice trays but there was an ice machine on the floor. There is no stove top but there was an electric skillet. Across the street is a small strip mall with a Times grocery store (somewhat expensive). The Kaanapali Beach Club is going through a room renovation program, beginning on the top floors, with a plan to have all rooms renovated within the next four years. It was obvious, when we checked in, that the furniture and rugs need upgrading. The A/C unit was a bit noisy but not unbearable. We noticed a musty odor when we first got to the room but after running the A/C for a few hours the mustiness went away. WIFI access is available in the lobby. There are no laundry facilities in the room. Each even floor has a small laundry, on washing machine and two dryers. Laundry facilities are free. Please note - this is a timeshare resort. I've seen a number of complains on Trip Advisor from people, who booked at a timeshare, but were expecting typical hotel services. As with most timeshares there IS NOT daily maid service. They do provide, in the middle of the week if you are staying seven nights, a room tidy up with towel exchange. Also, if you are not a timeshare owner here, there may be some fees such as parking so I would suggest that you check with the resort so that you know what fees to expect.

The staff is welcoming and friendly, and while it's not the Ritz Carlton, (it's more Embassy Suites) the location is what will bring us back over and over again. First, not only are you easy walking distance to coffee - Java Jazz across the street, and Bad A** (rhymes with lass) coffee down the street - but a short walk down the Beach brings you to Duke's Beach Club for Breakfast, Lunch, Happy Hour, or Dinner, and there is also a Grocery Store close enough to walk to. It's an easy 5 minute drive into Lahaina, and the INCREDIBLE beaches of Kapalua are about 10 minutes north. It's about a 40 minute drive from the Airport in Kahului (which is beautiful once you hit the coast). Overall, a very good jumping off place to see and tour the island. On to the resort itself. The beachy/ sandy part of the resort is fine, but once you get into the water there is moderate reef so water shoes could be advisable. (We never bring any, and just look for the sandy bits). They have lounge chairs, and a towel service, and you can sign up for stand-up paddling classes close by. There is a Gym at the resort and a lovely pool (with ample space for sunning, and also abundant lounge chairs), and there is a different musician nightly that plays in the lounge area. There are also Laundry facilities, a miniature golf course (it's not the best) and a parking garage, a place to get pizza, and even a few outdoor movie nights by the pool (with popcorn, of course!). That was cool. The resort is well maintained, clean, and landscaped beautifully with several Koi ponds. The rooms are comfortable, clean, spacious (very surprised by the space actually) and the beds are comfortable, bathrooms spacious (great towels), and the kitchen area, while small, is perfect for a week away. Only downside is no cooktop, but there is a microwave, and the market across the street has a deli section with roasted chicken and all that... You can also rent movies there as well (the grocery store is called Times). Seriously, no complaints here. Will gladly return.

The property is well manicured with several water falls, koi ponds, picnic areas with grills. Our $15.00 per day parking fee was waived :o) and they didn't even charge us the lost room key fee of $25.00 when my husband misplaced his key card.

Our \"Scenic View accommodation\" was of the road and if the wind was blowing down from the mountain you could smell the sulphur smell from the water treatment plant down the road :o( however, we really didn't spend much time in our room. The breakfast buffet was a bit overpriced at $15.00 per person for an average buffet. We only did that one day then started going to Java Jazz accross the street.

Upon driving up to the huge pink monstrosity, we were somewhat concerned, but were quickly put at ease when we saw the grounds and our room. The pool area and grounds are large and well maintained. There are plenty of activities scheduled daily, both for adults and kids, and a full activity centre for keikis (kids), complete with bowling alley, board and video games, etc. On-site fitness facility, spa and mini-golf course offer something for the whole family. Our room had been recently renovated, and the bathroom was HUGE! There is also on-site (free) laundry facilities which is a life saver! The bed was comfy too! Free wired internet in the rooms and wi-fi in the lobby and pool area. There are 5 grills down by the beach, and from our room we could see them being cleaned every day. We did not eat at the restaurant so cannot comment on that (drinks were pricey but they do have happy hour). We ordered a pizza on the day of arrival from the pizza joint and it was good. A vacation tip (and life tip for that matter) - If you treat the staff with respect, you will find that they reciprocate: we never had to purchase any additional supplies (some have mentioned having to purchase more coffee filters, etc). They also even called us to see if we needed a crib for our baby - now that's service! We simply asked our cleaner politely for what we needed and she was happy to help. Perhaps if you are the crazy lady in the gift shop having a melt-down because they didn't carry the local paper (the horror!), you might not get a great response from the staff. If you are lucky enough to visit during the whale season (Dec-Mar), you will surely see humpbacks frolicking very close to the resort. Snorkeling is so-so, but the beach is decent, not rocky.

The only downside was their was no stove/oven. However, you are able to request a rice steamer and/or slow cooker from housekeeping. There was an electric frying pan in the unit and barbeques down by the beach (which are a bit of a hassle if your room is on a higher floor or near the front of the building). The pool area is fantastic with lots of loungers, a children's pool with waterslide, waterfalls (good for an aquamassage after surfing!), hot tub, and direct beach access. The coral comes pretty close to shore so watershoes are a MUST. Snorkeling is excellent past where the surfers are (closer in is shallow, murky, and \"dead\" coral). The best surf lessons on Maui are right in front of the barbeques! There's a grocery store right across the street from the resort entrance (a block up the drive -- buy boogie boards there for $12 rather than renting them then just pass them onto another family when you leave) and a local bus stops right out the base of the drive that takes you either up to Napili or down to Whaler's Village. You can connect at Whaler's Village to go to Lahaina and the fare is cheap! However, if you want to see more of the island, tours can be booked through the concierge (which I highly recommend for the Hana Hwy drive as doing it yourself is exhausting) or you can rent a car. There's a fish market just up the road and a farmer's market right across from the Honokowai Beach Park which is a 10 minute walk. The farmer's market has awesome homemade guacamole and pineapple salsa. They also have a deli which serves all vegetarian food (the store itself is completely vegetarian so you need to go to the grocery store or fish market for meat/fish). The resort itself has a bar, pizza place, and restaurant for those who don't feel like cooking and want to spend lots of money on meals. To the left of the grocery store in a little strip mall is a fantastic restaurant for supper called Java Jazz. It has a great atmosphere and has live music (folk/jazz/blues) at 7pm every night.

We paid $1400+ for this trip, not counting the additional $2200 for r/t tickets to Hawaii from Colorado Springs. The salesman in Las Vegas gave me a login and password to the Diamond Resorts International website, and I thought I booked the vacation on that site. I got a confirmatory email stating that we had reserved an \"Ocean view deluxe\" suite, and were told it would be a completely furnished apartment in the resort. Arriving after dark on December 3, we were greeted by friendly valets, who handled their job beautifully. We went to the desk to check in, and no record of our reservation was on file. Luckily I had the email confirmation code number, and it took nearly 2 hours for the manager to figure out that the website on which I booked was an \"internal training site\" not a real site, and the reservation was canceled after the exercise, despite sending me a confirmation number and email. informed me that \"parking\" would be $16 a day.\" I told the manager that the least they could do would be \"comp\" the parking, which they did. Thank you. They put us in a room, admirably, since we really had no booking. The next day was pretty much wasted while we waited around, and we did take a drive, awaiting the matter to be cleared up. We got to stay in the same suite they put us into on the first nite. It was OK. Somewhat mildew odor typical of so many tropical places where they use carpets that get wet from people using the place, but not unbearable. The furniture was so-so in comfort. Good bed, two large flat screen TV's, however we had planned on using the \"apartment\" to prepare meals to save costs on our vacation. There was no stove, or oven. There was a microwave and an electric frying pan, but that was it for cooking options. The appointments were nice. Housekeeping was included once in the week, and the woman did a good job. The restaurant was OK, but the Luau was overpriced, the entertainment was good, but the food was nothing to write home about. By looking on \"http://www.hotels.com\" for a comparable week in 2012 pricing, the Royal Lahaina Resort has rooms for $159 a night, The Maui Coast Hotel for $165/night. The Mana Kai Maui for $122/night, the Castle Kamaole Sands, a Condominium Resort for $124 a night. So our \"Sampler\" at $200 a night plus parking was no bargain. We were apparently spared the repeat timeshare presentation others on this site have experienced. I was not going to attend it regardless, having killed way too much time in Las Vegas on this in the first place.

The week we stayed was actually a gift from one of my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s relatives for our wedding/honeymoon. The hotel was very nice, clean, and was nicely decorated around the pool with waterfalls, tropical flowers, palm trees, and tiki torches. The pool overlooks the ocean for a great view and just a short walk over to the beach. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable, with nice kitchen facilities (refrigerator, dishwasher, can opener, toaster, microwave, and glasses, dishes, and utensils). The $16/day fee for parking, as noted in other reviews, was a bit disappointing. Overall, all of the staff was very pleasant and helpful. When we checked in, we were greeted by a staff member from the concierge desk, who was very nice and helpful, and sat down at the activities desk to review what the resort had to offer and discuss potential activities we might be interested in. This was helpful, since we were interested in booking a few guided activities for the week. However, beware of the trap! They offer discounts on many activities if you agree to sit through \u00e2\u20ac\u0153a quick 90 minute presentation about the resort and Diamond properties, just to educate people and get the word out about what they have to offer.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We reluctantly agreed to sit through this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in order to save some money on activities, since it was a good offer, and booked our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd for mid-week. All of the discounts they offer are contingent upon you attending and sitting through the entire \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Well, Tuesday came around, and we went to the lobby area for this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What a show this was! This was one of the worst, most painful experiences I have ever sat through in my life. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was in fact a brief tour of the hotel and a sample room followed by an excruciating sales pitch about why we should buy a vacation ownership there. It was a worse experience that negotiating for and buying a car! We made explicitly clear from the beginning of this \u00e2\u20ac\u0153presentation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd that we were not going to be committing or buying anything, since we were newly weds trying to finish paying off our wedding and honeymoon trip. When asked about our jobs, we explained that I am a civil engineer and my wife is a scientist, so we both don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make rash decisions and like to really review and evaluate things before we agree to commit/buy (and read all the fine print about the hidden fees, which conveniently they neglect to tell you about!). This still did not deter our vacation counselor, Daniel, who I refer to as a self-proclaimed vacation dream weaver, from doing everything possible to get us to commit to buying a vacation ownership, even though he knew \u00e2\u20ac\u0153this probably wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for us\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd from the get-go. No matter how many times we said no, there would be \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just one last thing.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We ended up being stuck there for almost three hours, with the staff trying to pull out all the stops to get us to buy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a manager came over with this fancy story about special lei\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that he gave us; Daniel took us over to a big screen TV to show us some simple math about the money we could save by buying there, in what I now refer to as his vacation wheel of fortune; and being offered every discount they had. While we were treated professionally, I was pretty disappointed in their presumptuous attitude, knowing nothing about our personal financial situation and still trying to get us to buy something after we told them we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in the financial position at the current time to take on any other payments, regardless of how good a deal anything was. Daniel actually at one point in his fancy sales pitch, which involved drawing pictures in a fancy game of Pictionary for almost everything he described, did have the nerve to insult my intelligence to ask me if I knew what the word \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hypothetical\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd meant, as if it was some big word choice. One would think after we told him what our occupations were, he would have known he was at least dealing with two fairly educated people. After almost three hours, Daniel got a manager to come over to confirm that we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to buy anything. The manager made some fancy scribbles on a paper and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153signed us out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as if it was some kind of prison release. It was amazing at how their jovial attitudes changed after that. After finally getting to leave, we were greeted by a woman for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153quick exit survey\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, where she promptly asked us some questions, but once again threw one more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fabulous deal\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at us to try to get us to buy!

The resort is very nice a big. It has an open air feel to it since it is fully exposed to the outside. The only time you're indoor is if you are in your room or on the lowest ground level. We stayed at a one bedroom with partial kitchen, full bath and partial ocean view. The room was beautiful and clean. Bathroom had two sinks, soak tub, separate shower, and the toilet was in a separate room (added privacy). The kitchen had microwave, dishwasher, very small kitchen sink, coffee maker, blender, but no stove top (instead we got a hot plate cooker that you plug into the wall). The hot plate cooker was actually very good, we made steak dinner, eggs, even stir fry veggies. We saved lots of money on food by cooking dinner and making breakfast. There is a 16 dollar parking fee and free wi-fi only in the lobby, but some rooms can get reception if you are close enough to the lobby. I think internet was 10 dollars a day (we didn't get it). Since parking was so expensive we rented a car after our 4th day there so we only paid for 3 days of parking. TIP:: This hotel is actually very close to Kapalua-West Maui Airport (JHM) so if you want to save money you should fly into this airport instead of Kahului Airport. A cab ride from Kapalua airport is only 12 to 14 dollars while a cab ride from Kahulhi airport can cost up to 100 dollars each way. The hotel is located right on the beach which is great. Every night I slept with my window open so I could fall asleep and wake up to ocean waves. The bed was very comfortable so I had some of my best sleep here. The pool is very large and deep (up to six feet). There is a kiddy pool area with a small water slide for children. The pool is clean (I actually saw someone clean it in the morning) and nice. TIP:: When you check in you will get a towel card which lets you get a towel. They hold the cards until you return the towel and if you lost the card its 25 dollars so make sure you get your towel card back every time you return a towel. To save money on excursion we went to a timeshare presentation. We saved about 500 dollars booking with the hotel then if we were to book it ourselves. They did offer the best price. We were not pressured into a sale it was very easy we said no twice and then they let us off the hook. I think it's because we already own a timeshare and said we just don't want anymore, so maybe if you don't own anything they might press harder. We did our food shopping at the Times supermarket which is just a 10 minute walk. It's across the street and about 4 blocks to the right. TIP:: Starting 2011, Maui is BYOB, meaning bring your own bag. All venders do not provide plastic bags so bring reusable bags if you don't you'll have to carry your purchase in paper bags with no handles. There is a public bus route that stops right in front of the hotel. Bus fare is 1 dollar per ride so transfers are not free. The bus comes once every hour and the last best is at 8pm. All in all, this was a great resort. We did travel to other locations but if you want to just lounge around and do nothing this is the place to be.

She tried various tactics such as free meals, discounted activities. We kept saying no thank you and we are tired. Then she said well just wait a minute and she called her manager and then said to us \"OK, well if you agree to take the 2 hour tour, we'll give you a 4-day cruise for $20\". Well by this time our heads were spinning and it's not our style to be rude, but we simply said we are leaving now. Well so we finally got to our ocean view room. We had saved for our honeymoon and spent extra when booking through Orbitz to get an ocean view room. When we finally checked in to the ocean view room, we had to stand in one corner of the room and then we could look over the miniature golf course in the hotel and through the ventilation engines and then we could see a small block of the ocean. We were disappointed. So we went back to the front desk and said there must be some mistake. They pointed out to us that we did not buy a \"deluxe\" ocean room and that since we officially could see the ocean from our room, that was considered an ocean view room. We are polite people and don't usually write negative reviews, but we paid a premium for that room and this was very disappointing, so we decided when we got home we'd express our opinion. The only other negative was on channel 37 the owner of Diamond Resorts is on all day and night and he sits there in a chair with a fireplace and tells you why his properties are the best. It was like rubbing salt in a wound. Well, enough with the negative. But - there are certainly positives. The rooms are very nice. They are suites and roomy and a nice clean room with balcony.

It is a great resort for families who enjoy spending time at the pool and playing in the ocean. This place is huge and there is much activity; there are people everywhere. We had a 1 bedroom Deluxe Ocean View room (Room 109 on the Mezzanine level). The room was really on the 2nd floor just above the restaurant and kitchen. The view of the ocean was great. The only drawback to the location of this room was that for 7 days straight we had the odor of the grill in our room and at times; it smelled like hamburgers round the clock. At times it was quite annoying. The room has been described by the others and I won't go into any additional detail about that but I will add that the space was more than adequate for 2 adults. We ate out most of the days as the kitchen was really not set up for meal preparation and there was no place on the lanai to eat a meal unless you shared the little snack table between the 2 chairs. We ate at the grill one evening and the food was average. We also had the breakfast buffet and I was not at all impressed; the was food was just ok. It did not contain anything out of the oridinary; no hawaiian fruit (not even pineapple) that I recall and I would suggest that you walk to Duke's just down the boardwalk if you want a good breakfast (macademia nut and banana pancakes were awesome) with an ocean breeze. For those that like to exercise, the boardwalk through some of the close resorts was fun to walk (there were walkers and runners and many families with strollers) and led to a really good swimming and snorkeling beach. I was surprised that we were not asked to attend the Diamond Resort Presensation and we were happy about that. As noted by the others, the staff was receptive and very helpful.

I don't know however if it is OK to park there overnight. We were greeted by someone just after we checked in to rope us into a timeshare meeting during the week. They offered $125 of vouchers. We went to the meeting and they offered childcare for our kids while we were there. It took a total of 3 HOURS of our time and we were not pleased and neither were our kids. Each time we tried to leave, somebody else would pressure us. It is a real waste of time. While chatting with others in the jacuzzi, this man who was an owner said that if we really wanted to own a timeshare, it's better to buy it as a resale. We stayed on the top (12th) floor which was not good as when it rained, the rain hit the fiberglass roofing and the noise kept me up all night. The room had 2 full size beds in the bedroom (too small for my husband and me) so the kids stayed in the bedroom and my husband and I stayed in the living room sofa bed. Although the bathroom is very large, the room with the toilet is right against the shower, divided by a distorted glass wall. This was not a good idea as when I was taking a shower, my son had to use the toilet so I had to place a towel over myself until he was done. The kitchen was well equipped and had a microwave, dishwasher and electric pan. They do offer childcare, but our kids (7 y.o. twins) did not like it since they were not 10+, they were not allowed in the part of the room where they could play Wii and mini-bowling.

The propery is older and clearly showing its age, the common areas and hall ways are very marginal. However it is nicely located and the gardens are well maintained. The resturants are unappealing and the food and beverage staff were clearly puzzled on how to execute the gifts of champagne and breakfast in bed our friends paid for. In the end, it was such as hassle that we had to ask them to refund the money. The rooms are large with a separate living area with a small kitchen. The kitchen is nicely appointed which is important as we wanted to be able to make breakfast, have snacks and eat leftovers and given the food prices on Maui, this is important. The downside, maid service only once a week. We had a King size bed and a large bedroom. There was a very large marble bathroom with a soking tub and separate shower. Very nice.

The room is extremely spacious and very nicely decorated and as everyone else has commented on, the bathrooms are huge. There isn't a stove/oven in the kitchen but is fully equipped otherwise, refridgerator, dishwasher, sink, dishes, coffee maker, etc. Anyway, we made due just fine with the large electric skillet and microwave. The pool is exceptionally nice with plenty of lounge chairs. The resort was at maximum capacity and there was never a shortage of lounges. The ONLY negative was the fact that where our room was located you had no privacy on the balcony, so if you went out on your balcony you had to be completely dressed since your neighbor could be on their balcony only a few feet away. At first it was bothersome since I like to go out on the balcony, have my coffee and read the paper in the morning in my night clothes but I soon got over it. Again, it was the ONLY negative. As a resort owner we had free internet access and newspaper delivery daily; however, there is a $16 daily parking fee regardless of whether your an owner.

I strongly recommend going to Boss Frog's ( a small chain of equipment rental) and getting a snorkeling kit (about $35 for the week). The fish and marine life right outside the hotel's beach is amazing. We saw a ton of tropical fish and loved every second of it. Even if you are not a water person, Maui is a beautiful place to visit and I strongly recommend this island to everyone.

The micro wave is directly wired to the same circuit as the GFCI outlet on the counter. Once during the middle of supper prep using both, the breaker tripped. A call down and they had it reset within five minutes. The bathroom had a deep tub, a separate shower and w.c.. There was a pedestal sink at one end, a vanity style one at the other. Storage; besides a double long closet accessible from both the bedroom and bathroom with a shelf atop, there were 12 good size drawers split between the bedroom and living room. The night stands alongside the king size bed also had drawers. There were two TVs and two ceiling fans. One feature we really liked, central air with separate controls for temperature and fan speed. Since we were guests not owners house keeping came daily. They replenished everything and ran the dishwasher, once when the dishes were already clean. Being guests we also had the privilege of paying $16/day to park in the underground ramp. We ate only once at the resort restaurant, did the half price happy hour [3-6 PM] a couple times. Times grocery store and the strip mall is about the equivalent of 3 blocks away. The pool, heated to 81 deg., with its many waterfalls is beautiful. The \"lounge chair hoarders\" were out early in the morning spreading towels etc. across what they must have considered choice seating, however there were so many chairs available that we could always find a couple no matter what time of day it was. The beach is not very wide during high tide. We walked south about a quarter mile to snorkel, where it was only fair at best. After the tsunami the water was murky. One can stroll to Whaler's Village in about 45 minutes. After the first 100 yards there is the option of staying on the beach until Black Rock or doing the hard surface beach walk. We walked down one late afternoon to catch the sunset cliff dive at the Sheraton, the beach walk path is lighted. There is a lawn/garden on the mauka side of the grounds, not evident from the pool area, and only partially from the lower floors. There is a small white gazebo where we renewed our wedding vows. Though private it was not exactly ceremonious, I just asked my bride if she was willing to try it for another 38 years, she said \"sure, why not\". There is a bathroom in the lower lobby that has a cubicle and shower for cleaning up before heading to the airport for a red eye flight home, soap and towel are furnished. Cons: The already mentioned parking fee. Although the person we eventually saw was friendly and not pushy, we had to wait 20 minutes at the activities desk area to see someone for a parking pass. The only thing between our room and the laundry room [one washer and two dryers on even numbered floors] was a staircase so it was not difficult for us check availability or to use, but it could be if staying on another floor.

Room service daily was provided and the week we booked.....we also received free breakfast buffet coupons with our reservation. This was a nice added bonus. This hotel sits directly on the beach and has a large shaded if need be pool area. I would reccomend renting a car at the airport so that you have the freedom to come and go and explore the island. We did drive up to the top of the volcano which was an experience and well worth the trip...... \"take a warm sweatshirt or jacket....it's cold up there!\". We also did a whale watch trip with the Pacific Whale Foundatioon which was wonderful! Food is pricey in Maui......so talk with other vacationers to see where they have been and what they liked. The only thing we did not like about this resort was the daily parking fee..... which I believe was about $16.00.

So you can do your costco shopping and be fine for room. Plus there's a freezer on it. There are about 4 - 5 nice barbeques too where you can watch the sun go down as you make your dinner. During the Whale season, you can see Whales off shore too. My kids loved the free snuba lessons that they have daily in the pool. We watched older kids surf right off the beach along with people playing in the small waves, snorkling and of course snuba and scuba too! It's a great beach that you can do almost anything on for all ages - but you still need to watch the little ones as there are small waves and they can get bigger at certain times of the year. The pool is awesome and warm too! The resort is in walking distance to the supermarket, some small restaurants and the famous ABC stores of Hawaii. The facilities in the resort are also very good. Don't forget the Kids Club! (small fee for some projects/events). We couldn't get our kids out of there - they loved it! This is an awesome 4-5 star resort!

We are owners and bought here when it was still owned by Embassy. The resort has changed quite a bit since those days, and mostly not for the better. The good parts: The location and view are fabulous. We absolutely love the twin views of Lana'i and Moloka'i from the balcony, pool, and beach areas. We like that it's a quieter part of Ka'anapali Beach but still close to everything. The property is beautiful; the pool/beach area are just great. When our kids were little, they loved the pool. The suites are spacious and much nicer than a standard hotel room with a huge bath and a living room and kitchenette. The downsides: The service has deteriorated massively since the ownership change. The last time we were there, we had to wait past the 4 p.m. check-in time to get our room. We had booked a deluxe ocean view suite, and they tried to put us in one with a great view of the POOL and a side view of the ocean. We had stayed in deluxe ocean view before and knew the difference, and after an hour or so of wrangling with the front desk, we finally got a satisfactory room. But it was a stressful, unhappy way to begin our vacation, and seemed downright deceitful to me. You no longer get daily housekeeping or even towel service. In the Embassy days, we got daily housekeeping, free happy hour, and a discounted breakfast if you wanted one. I understand that most time share properties do not have these things, but having been there before the changeover, it feels like a take-away. The kitchenette is great for breakfast, snacks, and drinks, but other than a microwave, you can't cook. There are gas BBQs down by the pool, and there is a supermarket (including ready-to-eat deli meals) across the street. So it's not quite the same as a condo with a full kitchen, but it's pretty satisfactory most of the time. The restaurants on site are pricey and not that good--the coffee is OK. It's fine for sitting on the deck and having a cocktail for the sunset, but other than that, there are much better places to eat on Maui. All that said, we love the view and the location so much that despite the drawbacks, we keep coming back!", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, FL", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful location, grounds and accommodations\u201d", "Author": "rodbeeson", "ReviewID": "UR112805367", "Content": "Spacious, nicely appointed suites.

I dont know, maybe they can charge that much because of the location. It is right on the beach and the views are amazing. We stayed on the 10th floor in room 1004 The room was very spacious, especially the bathroom! Which is nice because we were using that room the most. Between the wet clothes and sweimsuits from the pool, or sandy clothes from the beach, it was nice to have that much space in the bathroom to really clean up and hang things. There are two sinks in the bathroom, that is great because the kiddos had their own space. The toilet also has its own little room with a door. Except I will say one thing, we couldnt find a fan for it, which kinda \"stunk\", so to speak. Countertops in kitechen were nice and the coffee maker was very nice and new. Kitchen gets an A+ especially since it had a dishwasher! Furniture was clean, but could use and update. The pool was AWESOME! It was very big, and never felt crowded. My kids loved the kids pool too. They could have stayed in that thing all day. It has a waterslide, which was used by the adults too! The beach is nice, I mean its not great, but hey you're in Hawaii, with the warm sun and the soft sand, so its hard to be unhappy. I have been to MExico and the sand here at this beach was way softer, and the snorkeling was great. You have to go a ways out, like past the buie (but not far) My husband say sea turtles here. We also saw whales from our balcony. Drinks are amazing, normal prices for fruity bar drinks, but at 3-6 I beleive, is happy hour where they are half off. The beachside restaraunt actually has great food. Very good quality, worth the money. The buffett breakfast, is just OK, I think its overpriced ($15 pp) for what you actually eat. Kids eat free so that is always a plus. There is a small strip mall right across the street with restaraunts and such, plus a full service grocery store, which was very helpful, we made dinner almost every night. The gift shop in the hotel also has everything you need, milk, bread, cereal, etc. but prob a little pricier than the grocery store. They also sell cases of beer, and alcohol, so that mght be something to consider before paying for high price drinks at the bar.

But as compared to Grand Wailea (South Maui), well, let's say the KBC is not so grand. But it's not a bad place to stay. The young man who checked us in was a bit scatter-brained. He forgot to give as cards to get pool towels; when asked about Easter Sunday services in the area, he kept trying to direct us to the hotel's Sunday Brunch, and (best of all) he forgot to set us up on the obilgatory timeshare tour. Since we still wanted to find Easter Sunday church service, we ended up talking with the Time share representative and did book some tours at reduced rates and carried out our obligatory 90 minute talk/tour. The young woman selling the time share was not overly aggressive and was quick to figure out that we weren't interested in buying anymore time share. She was pleasant and informative. She did tell us that she had already achieved a sale earlier in the day, so maybe she left us alone because of this. There was absolutley no other sales pressure beyond this 90 minute presentation. The pool and grounds are great. The beach is nice but short. Walking north you run into a canal pretty quickly. To the south, there are two condo buildings with very small shore line to walk on. If you go to the parking lot side of these condos, then cut through to the beach you can get on the Kaanapali beach path and walk all the way to Black Rock or even beyond if you choose. Parking fee is $16 per day, but very convenient. Hotel is walking distance to Times Grocery store and to the Fish Market to the north of the hotel. The Fish market was recommended by two locals (the bike tour van driver and a hair stylist). The Fish Market is a small deli in a strip mall near Honoapiilani Beach. It has very fresh seafood (like hours from the sea to the deli) and restaurant sandwiches and salads. We got sandwiches the first day and went back the second for deli Ahi Poke, shrimp, and crab cakes. We prepared the crab cakes in the electric fry pan provided in our room. Fabulous food! The room does not have a full kitchen. But for the two of us, the frig, microwave, electric fry pan, toaster and blender were enough. There is cleaning and trash removal once mid week so keep your towels clean :).

Yes -- at least on the \"non-pool\" side of the resort, I had free wireless access on the balcony. We're sad to be leaving, but a few other comments on the current amenities. It seems the resort has changed hands a number of times and available amenities change as well. The one-acre pool is great. My kids played in it all week. Friday was \"Aloha Friday\" and there were $2 grilled cheese and plenty of kids activities around the pool. The slide was shorter than some others, about 25 ft, but still entertained. The room was well-appointed though I did find myself wishing for a measuring cup.

Ate in all days except for dinner. Plenty to eat within a 5-mile drive -- highly recommend Paradiso Pizza directly across the street! A great greek homestyle food establishment. As a matter of fact, we're heading there tonight for our last dinner here. What else can I tell you that we wanted to know? Didn't really notice the \"pink\" after being here a day.

We picked up supplies at the grocery for b'fast and lunch and went out for excellent dinners (Sansei in Kihei, Star Noodle, Aloha Mixed Plate, and Dukes Beach House--which is on the next property and an easy walk w/ delicious reasonably priced food).

VERY OLD AND VERY MISLEADING!!\u201d", "Author": "panther777", "ReviewID": "UR94558959", "Content": "We are a quite surprised by the reviews on here rating KBC so highly. We purchased an entire week stay with KBC a year ahead of time through Diamond Resort Properties, and we used it for our honeymoon after our wedding. We purchased what was called a \"sampler package\" through a timeshare presentation we attended through another hotel a year before. We were told when we purchased the 7 day package with KBC and Diamond that we would never have to attend another timeshare presentation again. We could go there on our honeymoon and enjoy ourselves. The week before our wedding, we received a phone call from KBC confirming our arrival and advising us that we must attend a timeshare presentation while there on our honeymoon or else we would be non-compliant and would be charged $3000 on our credit card!! We were shocked and advised them we had already attended a presentation prior. They didn't even want to listen to us. We arrived within a few days after that phone call. The valet was very nice and the lobby was pretty. As we were checking in, the lady at the front desk advised us again that we had to appear and warned us not to be late for the presentation or else they would charge our card. We told her we wanted to speak to someone about the situation, but she kept insisting there was nothing they could do. Apparently, KBC likes to blame Diamond Resort Properties for any miscommunication, and vice versa...they just like blaming each other. We were told we would be given an ocean view room because we had actually purchased through Diamond on a presentation a year before, and therefore, we would be entitled to an ocean view room and be given a bucket of champagne upon arrival and be treated like honeymooners. To our horror, we got to our room and I opened back the curtains and saw multiple dumpsters and construction trailers in what appeared to be an old park. We even saw a homeless person urinating in the park. Then, our shower had the showerhead faucet coming directly out of the ceiling. There was a large hole and it looked like it was going to fall down any minute. You could move it from side to side and there were cobwebs up in the hole. In addition, there was a dirty razor blade on the shower floor where the housekeeping obviously missed and the shower was very moldy and our entire room smelled musty and old. The bed was so uncomfortable you could feel the springs digging into your back. We walked back down to the front desk to express our concern. The lady said that if Diamond promised us an ocean view room that there was nothing they could do about it and we had to speak to them but they were not available. They had us booked in that room, and she said to us, \"All of our rooms come with a scenic view even though they are not on the ocean.\" We laughed and showed her our camera with the photos of the dumpsters and I said, \"Does this look like a scenic view to you?\" She said, \"Oh, well, there are mountains in the background you can see.\" We told her we are from Phoenix, AZ and we have mountains in our own backyard that have a prettier view than this. We were told that no other rooms were available and we had no choice but to stay in the one we were given. Later on that same night, I asked for a showercap because there were not any in the room. They never brought one so I walked back down yet again to get one. The front desk staff took 10 minutes to find a showercap and finally brought me a cardboard box with showercaps that had the words \"Sheraton\" marked out with a black marker...very odd! The TV in the room would not work correctly. If you turned it off, it kept coming back on entirely on its own. The WiFi access would not work and we called the front desk. They gave us a number to call for maintenance to get help. When we checked out, they actually billed us for making that call to maintenance!! Each morning at 5 am, we were awoke by the loud sound of housekeeping dragging the vaccum cleaners on the ceramic tile hallways outside the front door. People checking out early also wake you up with the suitcase wheels being walked by. Because the rooms open to an outdoor atrium and it is all raised tile it makes it extremely noisy. When we attended the time share presentation as we were told to do, we advised them of all the problems we had. It was at this time that Diamond Properties told us that our room was one of those that had not yet been converted from the old Embassy Suites to the new remodeled ones. Diamond Properties intervened and that same day they got us moved finally to our ocean view room that we were promised. They did not push us at the presentation after hearing our story and seeing the pictures on our camera. They really did try and rectifiy the situation. The spa at KBC is really awful, and caution if you make an appointment there. As honeymooners, we wanted to go and get a couples massage and we found out they do not even offer that. We went to get massages anyway and the spa is the size of a closet with a couple of rooms. The towels were dirty and you could hear everyone's coversation going on in the place as you were getting a massage. I had to use the restroom at the spa, and they directed me to a cleaning closet with a washer and dryer, a dirty mop bucket and dirty toilet bowl brushes on the floor and a tiny toilet in the corner. Later, we visited the Hyatt Spa down the road...a must spa to go see...absolutely gorgeous! As for the food at KBC, the outdoor patio restaurant was not very good quality. We ordered some nachos for an appetizer and the salsa tasted like it was out of a Pace Picante jar from the market across the street. As for the buffet breakfast each morning...beware of the birds that swoop down and eat your food right off your plate. I sat my plate down on our table and walked away to go get my drink and came back to my plate with 3 birds standing on it eating my scambled eggs. One good thing about KBC was the sunset and the cabana rental. It was a really gorgeous view of the sunset. The beach was nice, but very small and cut off right away. We went to go for a walk and it only lasted a few minutes before you have to turn around and walk back. We spent most of our time in the cabana we rented on the beach. It was very nice and the cabanas had nice views of the ocean and were very close to the beach. For a couple of days, the pool was closed off with yellow tape around it and no one would tell us why?? Looking back, I am glad we never found out what happened...probably better off not knowing. We purchased tickets for their luau that they advertise by calling it the \"Feast By The Sea\" but they actually hold it in the basement of the hotel in a dark and dirty conference room! We will never stay at KBC again, and I definitely do not reccommend this hotel / timeshare.

We were crazy busy during the holidays and I finally got a chance to submit this review. Ka'anapali Beach Club is a great place to stay on Maui's beautiful west coast. From the second the valet guys open your door and you get out of your car, the spirit of Aloha takes over. These guys are always hustling and smiling and ready to give helpful directions or advice when we picked up our car. One of the guys also told me about a great radio station to listen to (Native 92.5) and I'm actually listening to it in SoCal right now on my iPad, since they broadcast online. The front desk was also very helpful and welcoming. They certainly made us feel at home. The time share team was very nice as well. Being owners definitely has its privileges and we were treated very nicely. Our second day there we met with Walter R. and we had such a great meeting with him that we decided to buy more timeshare. Walter is definitely a professional and I would strongly recommend people to meet him if you want to find out what timeshare is all about or if you want to expand your portfolio. The staff at the outdoor bar was great a well, especially a very gracious and super friendly Filipino hostess that kept the Mai Tais flowing. The pool staff was nice as well, but we did not spend a lot of time in that area, although it's a huge pool with plenty of room. We are definitely beach people so we spent almost all day hanging out in the beach and jumping in the beautiful blue waters of Maui. The hotel itself is very spacious and you never feel crowded. The rooms are very big, as well as the bathroom and the living areas and a great kitchenette. I agree with a few of the previous reviews however when they talk about the hotel feeling a little \"dated\". I don't think it needs a major makeover but I think a few tweaks would definitely help. I also wanted to comment on two other \"issues\" that were identified by previous reviews. It is no secret that this location is trying to sell timeshare, but if you express the fact that you are not interested, that is where it ends. The staff is not pushy and understands the fact that you are not interested. Another thing that struck me as odd is the people complaining about the $15 parking fee. That seems to be in line (if not cheaper) than most other places anywhere, especially in a resort area. It can cost up to $40+ to park your car in a hotel in NYC, LA or Paris. Overall, KBC is a great place to stay. The staff is warm and friendly. Its needs a small makeover but the Aloha spirit makes up for it...

One of the staff members thought we were \"owners\" and told us to go over to their VIP service desk for our free flower lei and parking placard. Well, the guy at the concierge/VIP desk told my daughter and I that we couldn't have the fresh flower lei that were for \"owners\", so we were given a shell lei. He would not let up with the sales pitch until I finally said all we want to do is go up to our room. That small customer service mistake set the tone for the next 8 days. 95% of the staff were very nice, but again, we found a letter under our door inviting us to participate in a \"survey\"--another tactic to get us to hear a time share presentation. Our vacation hours are precious, so we didn't want to lose any hours to hear a sales pitch. The original staff member that steered us over to the concierge/VIP desk saw we only received the shell lei and gave us a flower lei. We never wore the flower lei, but it was his tactics, that were upsetting. The hotel on the most part is very clean, but I found the laundry room dirty and in odd locations. They're only located on the even floors and only 1 washer to 2 dryers. We ordered 1 entree from the cafe located by the pool and it was disgusting, but the cinnamon roll was very good.

The check in staff need a refresher course in customer service - maybe because this is mostly time share owners coming in they don't feel they have to really explain anything ro give a care. The rooms are not bad. Beds are comfortable and bathrooms spacious. Our room was a handicapped room and had a different lay-out and a funky smell -we were told they couldn't move us anywhere in the hotel at all. However,the kitchen is not a full kitchen. Cooking is fine for microwave but otherwise they give you an electric skillet. The balconies are long and narrow and you can sit on the lounge chair if you keep it sideways on the balcony. For what they suggest is an all suites, time share property it needs some care and attention. I've seen plenty of time share places and this is not anything close to top notch. Standing on the inside of the building looking down or up at all the floors and the awful metal railings you could be in cell block H. There's a grocery store just at the end fo the drive in the stip mall across the road and you can also get the $1 bus to take you to Whaler's Village and then another $1 on into Lahaina. The Happy Hour staff are the best people there and the drinks reasonable. Food in the bar area is popular. There's also a coffee bar area that does pizza. The pool area is spacious but it needs some softening as it's lots of concrete. The beach area is small and trhey don't let you take loungers onto the beach. When we were there it was red flag warning but people swam anyway. If you have kids then this is a good deal. The rooms are big enough for a family and the kids will do fine with the facilities. if you are an all adult party, rent a car and spend time away from the property and come back in tiome for a late afternoon swim and Happy Hour! The timeshare presentations are as annoying as you let them be. Just say no and be firm or sign up, go along and see what you think. To us, their otehr resorts seem more in keeping with what they claim to be.

I hadn't been back for a few years when we'd stayed in Kihei. I really wanted to spend more time in Kaanapali to get a better feel for that part of the island. It has a bit more of a touristy feel becuase it's mostly hotels and high rises instead of the low rise condo's of Kihei. However the great shopping, better restaurants and proximity to Lahaina make it a great place to stay, just different that what we'd experienced last trip. Pool The resort has a great pool with cabana's available for rent if you like the shade. There are plenty of lounge chairs so the cabanas are not necessary, simply a nice option. I saw a few servers around the pool but if you want a drink you're better off just going up to the bar which is no problem, it's right next to the pool. They have decent bar food if you get a bit hungry but i wouldn't recomend it as a place to go for a nice dinner. The pool has a small water slide for kids and a hot tub for adults. The towel hut is right next to the pool so you don't have to haul wet towels around, just swap them back for the towel cards and bring the cards the next day for new towels. Beach The beach is not nearly as nice as the section on the other side of black rock where the big name hotels are situated. You can swim here but it's a bit rougher and the snorkling is lackluster. If you want better beach time you should go to the other section of Kaanapali, or better yet head up the road about five minutes to Kapalua bay. It's a lovely beach, decent snorkling, much easier water entry to go swimming and it's really picturesque bay with a coconut grove just up from the beach. It also has a walkway that will take you right around the point so you can go for a nice walk/run if you get tired of sitting on the beach. This beach was highly rated by \"Doctor Beach\" and I think he gave it #1 spot. Rooms We had a one bedroom and it was LARGE. Tons of space even if you had four people. The bed was very good and the bedding was decent quality along with two types of pillows. There is a regular fridge, coffee maker, microwave, toaster etc. but no stove. I read somewhere you could get hot plate but we only ate breakfast and late snacks in the room so we never inquired. It had the largest washroom I've ever had in a hotel room or condo. I'm not even sure why it's so darned large. They could have put more room into the bedroom or kitchen area. One nice touch is that the closet in the bedroom opened on both sides into both the bedroom and the bathroom. So you could get dressed right after your shower if you wanted. It had both a large soaker tub and a shower so you have both options. My only complaint other than the lack of stove, is that the lanai is really very small and cramped. Not really conducive to being comfortable if you want to sit outside and watch the ocean. Service All the staff were very good, helpful and well informed. No complaints about any aspect. Because we got the room through a time share swap we only got one day of housekeeping but she did a fantastic job. She tidied up more than was really necessary so we left a good tip when we left. I was never presured or even asked to participate in a timeshare presentation which was a welcome change. Parking Parking is an extra charge of $16 per day but that includes the valet if you want to use them, which we did. I have a bad hip and didn't want to be walking more than necessary. I'm never a fan of paying for parking at a resort, I think it should be included so I guess that is a complaint. The valets were absolutely top notch though. Really helpful, polite and truly a warm hearted bunch of guys if you took the time to talk to them and get to know them a little. We'll definitely be back if we have to swap a timeshare in the future. I think Maui is my second favorite island after Kauai and there is still a lot to see and do for my wife and I. I can honestly recomend this resort if you want to explore Maui. If you just want to sit on the beach and go swimming then I suggest finding a resort with a better swimming beach.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHoneymooners\u201d", "Author": "stephiek456", "ReviewID": "UR85993787", "Content": "We had an amazing time.

Handicapped parking is not very friendly. when valet closes at 11pm, and you arrive back after that we had difficulty finding proper spots for us. 3 times we had to go to lowest level and climb a flight of stairs to get to elevators. Just my opinion, but i think employee of the months can walk the stairs and give the much needed spots for people with disabilities. That and paying $16 a day for parking were my only big griefs with the entire place.

We originally requested a one bedroom ocean view did not get that but we were upgraded to a two bedroom scenic view. Did not need the second bedroom but the second bathroom came in handy. I did get to see a one bedroom when they were trying to sell us a timeshare and I can tell you they are exactly the same except for the extra bedroom and bathroom. Also this is a corner unit with two balconies so I am not sure if this room is like some of the rooms in the middle of the hotel.When you open the front door to your unit their is a foyer with a large bureau to pile all your junk on from your day trips. The foyer opens to a decent sized living room with a sleeper sofa, a couple of lounge chairs and a flat screen tv.The master bedroom is large with plenty of drawer space and closet space. The master bathroom is huge with two vanities, a bath tub, separate shower stall and water closet. The entire bathroom is done in real nice tile. the kitchen comes with a full size fridge, D/W, enough plates and silverware to serve eight and pots and pans. It did not have an oven or stove top but it did have a large electric fry pan that was good enough for us. Some people complain about no stove top but personally from my experience staying in plenty of time share units that had stove tops we very rarely used them even when our kids were younger. We ate breakfast in the morning usually cereal or waffles from the toaster then were gone for the rest of the day and usually ate lunch or dinner while we were out. We used the electric frying pan a couple of times to cook steak or hot dogs and it was fine. Their are plenty of gas grills on property if you want to use them. Their was also a good size dining area with a large dining room table. The second bedroom had twin beds and its own bathroom. The bathroom in the second bedroom was just your average bathroom with a sink, toilet and shower stall. We were on a corner unit ( #834) so we had two balconies. One shared by the living room and master bedroom and the other which was huge shared by the dining area and second bedroom with lounge chairs and table. The view was okay mostly of the mountains and highway but on the dining area side you could see the pool area and some ocean.Not great but I thought it was just fine. The unit itself was very clean they only offer complete maid service once a week but if you need towels and other things like toiletries and trash emptied you can call them and they will take care of it at anytime for no extra charge One thing that was missing was an over under washer dryer that I have seen in other time share units I stayed at. Their are washer and dryers on the even number floors but you have to pay 1.25 a load I was a little disappointed in this. The resort itself is right on the beach and the beach was a good size with the greatest sunsets you will ever see and good swimming. The pool area was large with plenty of loungers but if you want an umbrella you will need to get down there early to grab one.Their was also a hot tub. Check in and check out was quick and the front desk was very friendly when ever I needed something. In fact all the employees I dealt with were very friendly. Their is a parking garage underneath that you have to pay 16 dollars a day for. They have valet parking for no extra charge except for the tip you have to give to the guy every time they get your car. We did valet the first day then parked and got our car on our own after that. The hotel elevator goes to the the parking garage level so it was pretty easy. Their are a couple of places to eat at the hotel. Their is bar and grill that is open late, food was pretty good I also noticed a more upscale restaurant but not a lot of people eating there and probably pricier. Their was also a breakfast buffet every morning that cost about 18 dollars a person. They do have a concierge desk that was very helpful but let me tell you right now one of their jobs when you ask about activities is to try to interest you in going to a timeshare presentation. They will not pressure you so if you don't want to just say no and they will not bother you about it. But if you do go to a presentation you will get discounts on a l lot of activities. We probably saved about 200 dollars on activities by going to one and at the first opportunity to walk away we did. The time share presentation was not high pressure and we were able to walk away after about a half hour. The salesman will ask you if you are interested in going forward and all you have to do is say no. If you want to go shopping to stock up on food their is a shopping center across the road with a food market and a pizzeria. Their is a Safeway about a mile down the road which we thought offered the best selection and prices. Remember you are in Hawaii food is expensive. Other things they had that we did not use but noticed was an exercise room, a poolside bar and towel service at the pool. They also had activities planned everyday for kids and a Luau on Wednesday night. They also had photographers if you want a photo session with the beautiful sunset.

Pros: The resort is clean, quiet, large pool, rooms are pretty large with a small kitchen (but no stove), bathrooms are huge (with 2 sinks and a tub and separate shower), fast & easy check-in and check-out, the resort is ocean front, the beach in front of the resort is just so-so (a little rocky), 2 flat screen tv's in the room (1 in the living room and 1 in the bedroom), maid service is good, and our view was just ok (it was a view of the street and mountains). Cons: Parking is $16/day. And the staff is not as friendly/accomodating as i expected. When we checked in, my friend asked if we could get a free room upgrade but he simply said the resort was fully booked, without even pretending to confirm on his computer. and during our week stay, it was pretty obvious that the resort was not fully booked since there never seemed to be too many guests on the resort grounds. at every other resort in hawaii the check-in clerk would always try to upgrade our room without us even having to ask. so then after check-in we had to get our parking pass from the time share staff. we had to wait for about 5 to 10 minutes for the time share coordinator to finish gossiping with her co-worker for her to even acknowledge our existence. then the coordinator gave us each a free lei but after we said we're not interested in attending a time share presentation they didn't hassle us at all. Another time, we were at the resort pool and my friend ordered some nachos and after waiting about 45 minutes my friend decided to go to the bar/kitchen to ask about her order. the waitress seemed kind of annoyed and said she would bring her order over when it was ready. so overall, the resort had nice rooms but the biggest complaint for me was the staff. they just didn't seem as warm, friendly, and accomodating as my other hawaiian experiences, which isn't a big deal since we were out most of the time but in my opinion it really adds to my vacation experience when the staff is friendly and helpful. but in the end, i had a great time in maui so i would highly recommend the island but probably not this resort (unless you got a great deal).", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, Great rooms\u201d", "Author": "tibinaba", "ReviewID": "UR82642984", "Content": "I went with my fiance to get married in Hawaii.

No stove/oven, but the included hot plate allowed us to cook eggs every morning. We were told when making the reservation that we would not have a sea-view, but it turned out that we did, so that was another nice surprise. Most annoying about the room was a weird smell when we first walked in. According to the front desk it had something to do with the air conditioning being off between visitors. After we aired it out for a few hours the odor dissipated. We also had an issue with the toilet but we figured out that if we pushed the handle a certain way it would stop running. Overall, most of the issues were minor and we enjoyed our stay. The location was perfect, close to plenty of beaches as well as restaurants in surrounding areas.

I never get tired of coming to Maui. I can't help but think what a great deal I got with my timeshare. Since I originally purchased, which was way back when this was the Embassy Suites, I have upgraded my points twice, so I can come at least for 2 weeks a year. I have seen so many changes. When it was Embassy, it had lots of nice perks, then it was sold to Sunterra, which I consider the black times. The place really went downhill, was neglected and the perks went away. Since then, I'm happy to say that Diamond Resorts has purchased this property and there have been many improvements. The bedding is of the same quality as a Marriott. Very comfortable with top quality sheets. Top quality appliances and flat screen TV's have been added. They have Aloha Fridays with a BBQ and music at the pool. They have added an inexpensive, yet very nice Luau on Wednesday's. Every time I come back there are new changes, but for the better. My maintenance fees have double over the last few years, but I am okay with it, since they have made so many improvements. At least, I know the money is being well spent on the property. My only complaint is how expensive the food is here at the resort. I would much rather dine out than pay the prices they are asking. I did try pizza one night and was very disappointed with the quality and the small size pizza for $15. There is a new mixed plate restaurant in town and I plan to give a review as soon as trip advisor adds it. It is within walking distance of KBC and it's called, \"Ono Kau Kau Mixed Plate\". We like to eat local and we prefer this to the Aloha Mixed Plate, now. Ono Kau Kau, has an extensive menu of Chinese and Hawaiian foods. We had the Locomoco and BBQ Chicken mixed plate and not only was it delicious, but there was lots of food. I had the mini version and it still was more food than I could eat. The food was very fresh and hot off the grill. I heard other customers commenting on how good the chow mein was. I intend to go back and order Chinese food, before we leave. (We're still here as I type this) So, if you want good, quality, fresh local food for a low price, try Ono Kau Kau. It's our new favorite mixed plate restaurant on the island!", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Binghamton, New York", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "PatriciaB11", "ReviewID": "UR79584542", "Content": "We really enjoy staying at the Diamond Resorts thorought the USA.

Local called the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pink\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (but more like coral) building. The ground was nice, with multiple waterfalls, koi pond, big pool and a water slide. Our room had a partial ocean view yet it was on 2nd floor (RM 116) right above the air vent. It was just too loud to sit on the balcony or open the sliding door. It was also a very long walk to the ice machine (cross 2 sections) on the other end of the building. Likewise, it will be far from the ice machine side to do laundry over this side. Laundry/detergent costs $3.75 per load was reasonable. Room was comfortable, 1 king size bed with a queen size sofa bed. The mattress was thin like any other sofabed. It didn't have stove but had everythng else in the kitchen. There were two sinks in the bathroom and 2 doors connecting to master bedroom and living room. The bathroom was big. The parking fee of $16 was a bit stiff. The valet parking crews were very friendly though. I also found parking rather easily in the underground garage when I need to be in and out in short period of time. Internet access costs extra in the room (no wireless, only wireline) but you could get free internet access near the lobby.

Both couples were married on the same day and kept in touch after meeting on our honeymoon 10 years ago. After almost counting Hawaii out because of the cost, we discovered a Hawaiian bargain (expensive elsewhere) at the Kaanapali Beach Club (KBC). I must say that after staying at different levels of lodging, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t overwhelmed at first. However, I grew fonder of the resort the longer I stayed. The KBC pretty much had everything a couple/family would need (I know since I have 3 kids of my own) and in a nice location close to Whalers Village and Lahaina. It is settled directly on the beach and has a large pool area, both of which I discovered were rare in Waikiki where I went the following week. The structure is pink with 12 levels and all rooms are suites. They are nice and spacious with comfortable beds and large drawers to unpack your belongings. There is a small balcony area to sit on to overlook the resort/ocean. Please note that oceanview could mean \u00e2\u20ac\u0153as long as you can see a sliver of the ocean somewhere in the distance\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get excited if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not directly in front of you. The only thing really lacking was a stove although my wife was able to work something out with the electric skillet they provided. Every other floor has a washer and 2 dryers, which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t consider necessary until I used it. The restaurants exceeded expectations. There is a breakfast buffet for $15/person, which is good with an omelet station. The pancakes weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fixed the way I like and there was no waffle cooker but other than that breakfast was great. There was a variety and the fruit was amazing. We also ate downstairs 2 evenings. I must say that the food was really good with excellent coconut shrimp and a fish special that was tasty. The KBC even offered a few extras like a little fitness center, a koi pond with waterfalls, mini-golf, ping-pong, activities like movie by the pool and a DVD dispenser (like Redbox), which I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about until the last day. It is at least a noted place because there are vendors who come in the lobby and comedian Tom Green made a cameo (just missed him). Maybe because we were owners elsewhere or just missed, but we never got asked about a timeshare presentation. I highly suggest getting a car in Maui to explore the island. Yes, there is a $16/day +tax parking fee but truly enriches the experience. Also, it is only 2 minutes from the smaller Kapalua Airport, which is recommended if coming from another Hawaiian island. We did a round trip from our home city to Honolulu, then another round trip from Honolulu to Kapalua to save money (think about it). If you go to the KBC with the right expectations, you will find that it has what you need. Read further if you want to know what we did in Maui. With 4 head strong people on our vacation, we could not agree on what to do in Maui. But while out the 1st day, we stumbled upon an activity center and agent which turned our vacation from disaster to delightful. If in or going to Maui, I highly recommend contacting the energetic Lisa Kerstein from the Expedia Local Experts in the West Maui Center. The numbers are 808-667-7777 or 800-624-7771. It is located on 910 Honoapiilani Highway (Hwy 30), Lahaina, HI 96761 next to the Outlet Center and Subway. We sat down with Lisa for an hour and planned out the rest of our trip. She was honest with us on what was a good value, our taste and what days to go. Looking back, Lisa was a Godsend and probably the turning point to a positive and memorable vacation. What we did: Monday: Road to Hana \u00e2\u20ac\u201c All day event and recommend Paia (picked up lunch), Twin Falls (bring swimsuit for pics in water & water shoes to walk thru water on rocks), Waianapanapa State Park (black sand beach) and Oheo Gulch (didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make it but wish I would have) Tuesday: Helicopter Ride (Air Maui) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Quick \u00c2\u00bd hour tour to see most of Maui including thousand foot waterfalls and mountains unreachable by car Wednesday: Catamayran Cruise (Ahi Lanai?) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Snorkel & Snuba, like scuba but tank is on raft up to 15 feet above instead of back and no certification is required; Thursday: Dinner Cruise (Pacific Whale Foundation) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Great food and amazing sunset; Spa (Kapalua) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Ritz Carlton experience Friday: Luau (Drums on the Pacific) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Get to the Hyatt early because popular from good food, drinks and show including fire-dancer", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington", "Title": "\u201cIt was ok, but we will never stay there again!\u201d", "Author": "RoseWashington", "ReviewID": "UR75704255", "Content": "This is our third stay at the Kaanapali Beach Club. We love the location because you are only 5 minutes from Whalers Village and 10 minutes from Lahaina. We have rented a timeshare from people in the past and this trip we actually bought this timeshare rental on ebay. So we got a two bedroom room for a week for $1175 which I know is an amazing deal. However, when I called the hotel to ask if we could request an oceanview room, they informed me that all 2-bedroom suites have an oceanview. Great! I thought. When we checked in I again requested an oceanview room and they then informed me that we had one waiting for us!. Ha! Once I checked out the room we realized the oceanview was only if you stood out on the balcony and leaned over the railing. I went back to the front desk (and waited in their crazy check-in line again) and they informed me that they didn't have anymore 2-bedroom oceanviews available because they save those for the Diamond resorts owners. Even though we were guests of an owner. It was so frustrating. The room themselves are nice enough and we even had a stovetop which was nice to cook with. The pool area is great for the kids and they loved the slide. The first time we stayed at this hotel breakfast was included along with a managers reception every afternoon for free. The mini golf was free for all guests, and there was no hotel room tax per night. This time breakfast was an astronomical amount, the afternoon managers reception was for diamond resort owners only, they charged for the falling apart mini golf course, and charged us $70 at the end of the week for a room tax. The most frustrating thing to my husband was after we used the first little bag of coffee he called to ask for more and they said they don't provide extra coffee that the first one was only a \"starter coffee.\" So, it's a fun family hotel on a budget, but there are many other hotels around for the same deal that won't nickle and dime you for everything. I wouldn't stay there unless you were Diamond Resort members. For sure stop at Costco by the airport and Safeway in Lahaina to get your breakfast, lunch and snack food. We saved so much money that way. We also went to Gazebo restaurant in Napili for breakfast, we had the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes. They were amazing!!!

This place isn't fancy, but was exceptional for the $ and that's why I'm giving it a great rating. Don't come here expecting the Grand Wailea, Hyatt or Four Seasons.

If you're going to spend your hard earned money on Maui, don't do it here. You can't miss this place, it's a bright pink skyrise off of Highway 30 just past Lahaina. It's rather run down and outdated in my opinion compared to some other resorts I've been at. My parents agreed to attend a \" timeshare presentation\" in exchange for some discounts on excursions etc. My father is a hard sell, and after the woman clearly became frustrated at not being able to win him over, exclaimed loudly not once, but two different times \" Well I certainly wouldn't attend a presentation like this if I had no intention of buying anything\". That was unprofessional and uncalled for, especially because they're already owners!!! She also nosily questioned my single about her marital status and if she kids and upon learning she was a single mother told her \"it must be hard\". RUDE. Keep your thoughts to yourself lady and maybe you'll sell more timeshares! We were on the 9th floor and while I will say the views were spectacular, the railings outside are totally unsafe for small children! There's a huge gap where a small infant can easily fit under and fall through. They have locks on the sliding doors at the top but if you don't remember every single time to lock them your child could unlock the sliding door and slip outside. They need to fix that. The AC broke and one guy came up to fix it then said he'd be back and never came back! The next guy claimed he fixed it but it didn't work and we were all hot in our room. Couldn't open the sliding door because there's no screen to keep out the bugs and can't leave sliding doors ajar with an 18 month old in the place. According to my mother, advertises \"Full Kitchen\". Instead what we got was a crockpot, a blender, and a skillet. No stovetop. Last time I checked a full kitchen had at least one burner to cook on!The glasses were all tiny juice glasses and we had to request some steak knives to eat our steaks that we grilled outside because there were none. Tip of the iceberg was, after 5 days we ran out of coffee and they refused to bring more up without charging us. We were livid, especially we hadn't so much as asked them to clean the rooms yet, we thought it a minor to request to be charging for especially when it was just cheap wholesale hotel coffee.

The Lanai was a bit narrow, but with spectacular views overlooking the pool, we quickly adjusted to the long-skinnny model. The gorgeous pool area, outside elevators, multiple fountains, coy ponds, and open walkways added the extra touch to really make the entire experience one to stand out and remind us why we work the rest of the year! Close to Lahaina for dining and shopping, and just out of reach of the common Kahana daily rain showers. So the big positives; clean, quiet, gorgeous surroundings & views, pool, friendly staff, ocean front property. The minor negatives (in comparison) parking at $16 a day is steep and spaces are made for compacts only. Could have done without the 1.5 hour sales pitch on timeshares (but worth the savings on our activities). The Hot tub is TINY. From our room we thought the kiddy pool was the hot tub (to comfortably accommodate a resort of this size). Sadly mistaken to find the hot tub was barely larger than any backyard! It was way overcrowded EVERY night. Sad to see our time come to an end. We would (and have already) highly recommended this resort.

It is a huge high rise, not my idea of a Hawaiian vacation. They really do nickel and dime you here. If you want a lounge chair facing the ocean you have to pay outrageously for it! If you rent a car be prepared to pay $16 a night to park it. There is some sort of tax just to be there of about $5 per day. You have to pay to use the laundry machine, there are none in the rooms. You have to pay for internet service. We could not get an ocean view room once we got there which was very disappointing after spending all that money to get there. The unit we got sleeps 4. My husband and I had the master bedroom and my daughter and mother had the living room. The only bathroom was through our bedroom, which meant no romance for us all week. There was some kind of fan in our bathroom that would go on and off all night. The kitchens were very basic. Microwave only, no stove or oven. We tried to use the BBQs downstairs several times, but it was like being in a wind tunnel. They say they have scuba diving there and they do, but you have to pay $$$ for a boat trip. They will not just rent you a tank so you can go off the beach. It was so windy in that location the whole week we were there it was disappointing. (Not their fault I know.) It was so windy that they had to have the Luau in a conference room in the basement area. Yuck. My husband and I decided we didn't want to go to a Luau inside like that, and it took 2 days to get our money back. There pool area was nice and clean, my daughter loved the slide.

The concierge asked if we were interested, we said no and they left us alone for the rest of the week that we were there. I had requested an upper floor with ocean view and that is what we got- not directly over the ocean but definitely a side view from our balcony. These are suites (old Embassy Suites) that have been updated and modernized. The only thing we didn't get was a flat-screen TV and I really did not care. The rooms were HUGE and bright and airy, the kitchenette was perfect for our needs, mostly breakfast, some lunches and an occasional take-out dinner. It was Spring holiday for many, so lots of young families and kids in the pool. But not to worry, plenty of pool space and besides we were there to whale watch --saw whales breaching every evening from the beach - and snorkel -best snorkeling at a public park walking distance from the hotel. Can highly recommend whale-watching excursions with Trilogy and Maui Adventure and luau at Old Lahina Luau (the most authentic). All very accessible from the Beach Club. There is a supermarket right across the street and some restaurants. Happy Hour at the Ohana Bar is pretty good, I loved the Kahana Banana. But since we had a blender in the room, we saved some bucks making our own margaritas (good liquor selection at the supermarket). We had rented a car (just do it!) and drove up and down the west side for beaches and snorkeling and to visit all the towns--they are all different and each have their own special charm. Staff was friendly, responsive and attentive and we had a great time.

So check in- requested a ocean view, but they didn't have one, so they gave me a partial view which overlooked the pool/ocean. Still very nice. The hotel used to be an Embassy so all the rooms are suites...bonus. At check in they will take you and schedule any events you'd like to do that week- not a scam. They really do just schedule them for you. We surfed twice while we were there and once the hotel booked it and the other we did directly- it was the same price. They DOOOO however after scheduling all your stuff try and get you to do the timeshare meeting. From reading past reviews I avoided it like the plague! They do offer you a deal on your activities prices, but it wasn't worth it to me. Like I said we had an updated room which was very nice. If you wanted to cook, you had literally every appliance that you'd want including a griddle! There is a grocery store just across the street, which is super handy. Bathroom was HUGE and the bed was comfy. Parking is 16 bucks a day whether you self park in garage or vallet. We opted to vallet and give them a couple buck tip so we paid 18 bucks. Either way it worked out fine. There is tons of room by the pool and free beach towels that you can exchange as many times as needed. Free scuba lessons too! The ONLY \"rip off\" thing I would say is breakfast. Its 15 bucks a person (which lets face it...in HI everything is expensive!) but really probably not worth it. There was as starbucks not far, so we'd get that or just make coffee in the room and bought breakfast from the grocery store. We did eat dinner once in our hotel, food was pretty good, but yes expensive. FOLKS lets be honest you're in Hawaii....everything is expensive. We budgeted 100 bucks for every dinner and we were most of the time right on or a little under. Just a fair warning. Pool area does close at 10pm, which we thought was kind of early, but I guess all hotels pools around there close at 10. Maui really wakes up at 6 and goes to bed by 10. Hope that helps!

I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the island and her people. My trip was wonderful and I hope that some of my info can be used to help at least one traveller make their stay on Maui a great one. We were the \"guests of an owner\" at Kaanapali beach club, so we were roped into that glorious timeshare sales pitch. ONLY do this if you have the time to waste...they WILL hold you hostage all day long! The only thing that makes it worthwhile is they give you $100 woth of vouchers to spend at local spots (which was the equivalent of eating out at a nice place for two with drinks) If you do schedule for the sales pitch BE SURE to book your discount activities before you do the seminar...they didnt tell us this and we got hosed and missed out on saving lots of cash on our outings! Our room was on the 11th floor and smelled musty and dirty....like a wet moldy dog! The rooms looked a lot nicer in their brochure so dont be fooled, no ALL rooms look that good! The model they show you during the sales pitch is gorgeous, and I have to say if our room had looked like that, we would have been incredibly happy! Otherwise, the hotel staff (not the sales staff) is great, they are accomidating and friendly. Ask for Dave at the bar, he is wonderful. The food at the resturaunt is so-so, but for the money you spend you could have eaten somewhere nicer. But is it convenient. Breakfast buffett for 2 was thirty bucks. If you rent a car, definately do the Road to Hana. Stop in Kahalui at the Shell at the corner of 36 and buy the CD tourguide. It is worth the 20 dollars and you will learn so much, and see things you otherwise would have missed without it! While on the road to Hana, stop at Kak's Thai food stand...she is quite the character. And if her friend Diana is there, she may serenade you with her ukelele like she did for us! Be sure to take your camera, extra batteries film or memory card! We did the Maui Ocean Rafting whale tour out of Lahaina and they were great, eco sensitive whale lovers who got you up close without the crowds! Plus the price was much much cheaper! We chartered a Marlin fishing trip with Start Me Up out of Lahaina and DIDNT catch a single fish!!!! Other boats were coming back to the harbor full of Mahi mahi...hmmmm??? We took Pride of Maui from Maalea harbor to snorkel Molokini Crater and they were great...the boat was a lil bit older than some others, but so much less crowded...we had less than 20 people and the crew was AWESOME!!! They grilled a killer lunch and waited on us hand and foot, plus the captain was a mellow fellow and we jammed to UB40, Bob Marley and Don Henley on our trip. And honestly...the BEST mai tais I had on the island were on the Pride of Maui! Definately check out the upcountry...If you are adventurous, leave Kaanapali beach and head north...this rund into a very very very narrow one lane road, but you will see Maui at is finest. The local stands and people truly show the flavor of Maui. Stop in and buy some of Julias Worlds best Banana bread. Watch for locals and thier hog hunting dogs, as they can sometimes be in the road. Kahalui can be reached by this road...but its gonna take a while to get there. If you dont want to go too rough and country with your upland adventure, go south into Kahalui and take the road to Kula and on up into Ulupaulakua Ranch and Tedeschi Winery, be sure to look at all the historic points nd you may have to ask for help locating them. There isnt exactly a tourguide, and the people at the Winery were too busy with wine tasting to tell us about the Hawaiian cowboys, or poniolos. Snorkeling the beach at Kaanapali is great! Just walk up the beach toward black rock, or drive up about 3 blocks. Snorkel anywhere! Be sure to take your cameras as turtles frequest this area! Lahaina is the bomb, shop, shop and shop some more. Then eat at Kimo's then shop some more!!! Did I mention, I love Lahaina? Check out the history then head to the harbor and book something to do! Then come back and eat at Kimos again and shop some more! Be sure to immerse yourself in the culture and learn as much as you can, Hawaiians appreciate that, dont be just another tourist. You will be glad you learned something about such a beautiful place. Ther is a Wal Mart in Kahalui....they sell kitchy souveniers there for about 1/3 the price than the other places. In Lahaina on the corner of Prison Street right across from public parking is a little store that has Tshirts 7 for $20, Whalers General Store had pretty competetive prices. Check out Maui Hands for a one-of-a-kind souvenier. I got a hand made sterling silver hibiscus necklace that I treasure from there. Also, on Lahainaluna Street are a couple of local ladies with a vendor booth that sell stuff pretty cheap, right next to Boss Frogs....Also be forewarned...all the CHEAP tickets places in Lahaina want you to go to a timeshare sales pitch in order to get their CHEAP prices, the only one that doesnt require it is Expedia booth there at the wharf. Oh, and in Lahaina, go to Local Boys and eat shaved ice ! They are the BEST ever! But my best advice during your trip to Maui....take lots of pictures!!!!!!! Hope this helps!

We let him know right up front that we had no interest in scheduling a timeshare presentation and he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pressure us.

We stayed in suite 619 which looks down on the mini-golf game and parking lot below and has a decent ocean view when you lift your eyes (it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all a matter of perspective). It was great to watch the whales out in the ocean every day. Unlike some other reviews, our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any musty smell. The suite was spacious, clean and perfectly suited our needs. The king sized bed and pillows were very comfortable. As stated before, there is no stove or oven, just a microwave.

There is a children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s pool area with a water slide. The children there seemed to be having a great time. One evening there was a free movie night by the pool. A portable movie screen was set up and the lounge chairs were positioned around it. We had a great view from our table at the poolside restaurant, where we ate several times. The staff at the poolside restaurant was great. We had eaten lunch there first while we were waiting for our room after checking in the first day.

It was hilarious because in the stores in town they were selling t-shirts that read, \"I survived the Tsunami- Hawaii 2010.\" I was going to get one, but thought I'd be perpetrating a fraud since I came the day after and didn't even live through the hype and fear like others. The resort itself is about 40 minutes from the airport. The drive is gorgeous along the ocean. There are spots along the roads to get out and take pictures, beware, the road is windy and gazing tourists can drive carelessly and only one crash could end up in the ocean. The resort itself seem to be in resort central. And this Diamond property is just as good as the others, perhaps better. Ok, the tips I'll offer are for folks that are trying to spend their money wisely, if you're a high roller just know this place is great and enjoy. Tip# I would rent a car while staying in Maui either in town or at the airport, they have shuttles and public transpo, but the freedom of a car is worth the experience. Tip#2 There is a small grocery store down the street that is open sort of late, but DO NOT buy your groceries there, take a 10 minute drive to Lahaina and go to one of the bigger grocery stores there, cheaper and more selection, plus lots of other shopping. Tip#3 There is no oven, but they do provide an electric skillet, keep that in mind when you buy your groceries. Also, they have a WONDERFUL courtyard full of PROPANE grills (yea- no messy charcoal) along the beach with a lovely pond. The grounds are beautiful. You feel like you are experiencing Maui without even leaving the premises. Rooms are clean and spacious. Bathroom and tub relaxing, bedding, furniture seem high quality. Free wireless worked fine for me in the lobby. How fast do you need it on vacation anyway. Tip#4 Save yourself a few dollars and park your own car in their garage. They have elevators to take you up to the main floors. The valet folks can be pushy though. It is $16 a day to park in the garage so budget that expense. Front desk staff was forcing themselves to be nice, but who cares, fake is better than rude. Tip#5 The tides were high and not good for swimming or snorkeling along their beach, but you can walk as far as you want behind other resorts, what do they care. The walk and sunsets are spectacular and you can watch the whales doing mating dances for each oher from your cabana or lounge chair. After about 4 or 5pm, you can sit in the cabanas for free, staff leaves, and there is no one to charge you, nice for sunsets. They provide scuba trips and snorkeling gear at the resort. $35 for snorkleling all week including the gear. Scuba is about $80 for 2-1/2 hr and they train you, take you out in the ocean and you actually do get to see interesting sea life, one lady saw some kind of shark fish. Sounded like a good deal, I wasn't remotely interested in getting up close and personal with any kind of sharks, fish, minnows, etc. Not my thing. Some folks packed their own snorkeling gear. To snorkel on your own you may need to drive down to Lahaina or along Kaanapali Beaches to find good spots. I saw lots of people on their own at different beach parks raving how better the water was at the beach parks than at the resorts. The pool is lovely and beautiful and right next to the beach as well as a restaurant and grill. Tip #6 The restaurant has unbelievable ribs! Drinks are expensive, but hey that is what I came here for to eat, swim, shop, and sight see. The wait staff was rude and I told one off and made a scene who then got her manager involved and they were overly friendly then, but fake. There are also a ton of restaurants in Lahaina, 10 minutes away along the bay. You have to go down the little shopping strip full of vendors, hippies, bars, clubs, galleries, movie theatre, restaurants and a production called Ulalena- a must see! Tip#7 I agree, book all your sight seeing tours on your own or online, most places have online specials. Plus, the concierge lady spent most of her time talking to the presentation staff and totally ignored me. The manager had to get her attention. Get brochures from her desk. The presentation staff was nice, but had me sit there for about 10 minutes before someone even talked with me. It was a waste of my time since I already own with Diamond, they wanted me to add the Hawaii collection. Get real, how often am I going to get to Hawaii. Plus, Hawaii IS part of the US Collection, so why would I do that. When they realized I wasn't an idiot, the thing only lasted about 40 minutes. Tip#8 Don't buy anything from the gift store. Everything is sold in Lahaina $20 cheaper. But DO buy from the guy who carves things in the lobby. He's a nice guy and trying to support his family. Times are even harder for the locals than in the mainland. Don't just stand there gaulking at him, taking pictures of him carving and not buy anything, how rude! Tip#9 They have a Luau on Wednesdays for $60. That's totally up to you. I thought it was free. I wasn't going to pay $60 for a meal and entertainment everyone else can stand around and see for free. Plus, there are plenty of Luau's to go to with better entertainment, that cost the same. Tip #10 I island hopped and didn't get too many days to just do nothing. This resort is beautiful enough and with Lahaina so close, you can do nothing at the resort and enjoy yourself, make time to do nothing. Island hopping is expensive because there are no more ferries only airfare, but like I said I went there with certain intentions to sight see and shop. If you do island hop be prepared to spend over $1,000 per person for airfare and tours, but worth every penny. Polynesian Tours or Adventure Tours are wonderful. Aloha! The pictures they provide on their site are real, so what you see is what you get, fortunately.

I read the reviews before we left so I was already well aware that we would be asked to attend a timeshare presentation. When we arrived to check in the bell boys said they would valet park our car as it would take us awhile to check in because we would have to meet with the concierge. We already knew the concierge was the one who would try to get us to go to the timeshare presentation. The girl who checked us in was very nice. She gave us a welcome folder, our keys and our pool towel cards. If you don't return your towel cards at the end of the stay you are charged $50.00 per card. She then told us to meet with the concierge who would tell us how to get to our room and explain the resort. We said ok but we didn't meet with her. We went back to the bell boys and gave them our room #. We got to our room and saw that it was a handicap room and didn't have a tub. I called downstairs and ask for another room. She said the only one available didn't have as nice of a view it had a view of the mountains but I said I would rather have that, so they sent the bell boy up with our new keys and he moved our stuff to the new room. The rooms were nice enough. No burners but they brought us an electric skillet to use. The bathroom was very nice with a large soaking tub. The pillows were uncomfortable but housekeeping brought up feather ones. We were there during the Tsunami warning and the hotel was great about moving anyone on the 2nd floor up to a higher floor and keeping all the guest informed. We bought a bunch of groceries just in case and ended up giving them all to the bell boys when we left. The only negatives during our stay was we wanted to book a dinner cruise and went to the activities counter at the resort. The woman who worked there tried to talk us into going to the timeshare presentation for a better rate. I told her we weren't interested we want to pay the full rate yet she kept on about it. She didn't want to take no for an answer even trying to throw in a free 3 day stay in Sedona. NO NO NO!!! The dinner cruise was canceled due to the tsunami so I had to meet with her to reschedule and she again started pushing the great discount she could give us. Really NO means NO we don't wanna go!!! She was really pushy and unfriendly. The other negative was the pool would run out of the towel cards so I was worried I was going to get charged the $50.00 for the towels. The pool guy said I wouldn't but each time I stopped at the front desk on my way back to the room and ask for 2 cards just in case. All in all the hotel is nice and in a great location. You can see the whales from the beach. I would stay here again but book my activities from someone in town and avoid the hotel concierges. Also want to mention parking is $16.00 per day and internet in the room is wired and is $9.99 per day.

The rooms were very nice they were a bit musty but controlled with the doors open (who would not want the doors open with that that beautiful sounds and air?) The Suite was very large and had 2 queen beds in the bedroom as I was traveling with my best friend. There were even 2 sinks on opposite sides of the bathroom from each other. The service was exceptional. The blender came quickly and the skillet came the next day (we didn't use it) The time share people were nice (of course they would be) I told them right up front that i couldn't buy but they still talked with me for close to 21/2 hours but worth the hotel stay. We both had a blast!!!! If you want an easier exit to any presentations then don't ask questions. Ive also learned that most people that write in reviews had a bad experience and people that had a blast like us don't. We had the mini golf view but could see the ocean too. The Lani was skinny but there were lounge chairs out there that you can sit on and watch the ocean too (partial view but enough) The pool is super nice with plenty of chairs and a lot of umbrellas. The surf isn't for swimming right there but walking on the sand to the restaurants was good and there are plenty of beaches near by. Any way don't be scared by negative reviews!

Here are some things I would point out for anyone planning a trip and staying at the hotel: 1) YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GET SUCKED INTO A TIMESHARE PRESENTATION!!! At the checkin, they do indeed tell you that to finish the process they have a person show you to the VIP Services desk. They offer you a $100 dinner certificate for sitting in on a presentation. Simply say \"NO, you have no interest in that\". That totally ended the discussion then and there. We were never asked again about participating. End of story. No problem with that. 2) We stayed on the 10th floor overlooking a parking lot but with a mountain view. I would have loved an ocean view but we didn't opt for that nor did we request it, which was our fault becuase it sounds like some people can get it just for the asking. However, we were on the go so much that we didn't miss it as we were out in restaurants who had nice ocean views for dinner, etc. 3) We had a one-bedroom suite. It was quite spacious for the two of us. If I had children, I would definitely opt for a 2 bedroom just to get away from them and let them have their own space. As mentioned throughout, the bathrooms are huge. Two sinks, a large tub, and large separate shower...all of which is nicely tiled. The beds are incredibly comfortable. Overall furnishings in the living room area were tropical in style, with lots of space in the dresser and other pieces throughout the rooms. Kitchen is newly remodeled with nice granite counters. Nice flat screen TVS in both living and bedroom areas. Really nice long closet with full mirrors on both sides. The closet opens from both the bedroom and the bathroom. Rooms were very clean but did have an odor...but it wasn't bad enough to move or even make me go out an buy a room freshener. 4) Some other reviewers commented on not having a stove. This was not a negative for us because there was a huge brand new Cuisinart skillet in the kitchen cupboard which was perfect for making eggs/bacon in the morning which is all we needed for breakfast. You could easily fix skillet meals if you wanted to. Also, there was a new stainless Cuisinart Coffee Maker which makes up to 12 cups of coffee but serves one at a time which was a very nice feature since it kept the coffee warm without burning it. Also, there was a really nice toaster. All of these appliances were Cuisinart. Nice dishwasher and they provide dishwashing liquid, powder, and all serving pieces and serviing ware. Very nicely furnished. 5) I am a DeCaf coffee drinker and the amount of coffee they supplied would only last a couple of days. My husband rang up the front desk and within 30 minutes of arriving, they had another half dozen coffee packets for us. We bought our own splenda and creamer (I have to do that in most hotels anyway) 6) Staff was just super. My husband is the type where if anything is wrong or he needs anything, he will call the front desk. They were very cordial, bent over backwards to accomodate our needs, and overall incredibly responsive. 7) We only ate at the outside grill one time..otherwise we ate elsewhere. Didn't do their buffet, but we did go to the one at the Hyatt Regency. It was incredible, but it was also $35 per person.... so that makes the $15 one at the Beach Club sound pretty good. Most other mornings we cooked on the skillet or went to local places. 8) Location is fabulous. it's easy to get to anywhere on the island from the Beach Club. We went all over the place and found that Kaanapali is a great jumping off point. Some other recommendations below. 9) For a Luau go to the Hyatt Regency's Drums of the Pacific. Great food and fabulous entertainment and right next to the beach. 10) For snorkel and sailing, you absolutely cannot beat the 1st class service you get with Alii Nui. Huge new catamaran, fabulous service, great breakfast and dinner and wonderful overall experience. If you are planning on whale watching, you may want to do this first as we saw 3x as many whales going out and coming back in as we did on the whale watch trip we took. 11) Go to Mama's Fish House. A bit pricy but food was excellent. Overall, staying at the Beach Club was a very good experience with lots of amenities. Yeah, $16 for parking may seem alot, but try parking a car in D.C. or a NYC hotel. Keep that in perspective. Also, remember you are not paying Hyatt Regency or Four Seasons hotel prices for what you get.

Positives-- The room, especially the bathroom, was large and comfortable. The room and resort was quiet and peaceful, no problems with noise from other rooms or excess noise from activities (e.g., Karioki). The view from our 11th floor lanai was outstanding and we saw dozens of whales every time we sat outside. The whale-watching along the Kaanapali Beach was better than any location we experienced on our drives around the Island. The beach was very nice and not crowded and we enjoyed the snorkling right on the beach-- tried Black Rock but it was jammed with snorklers and not really much better variety of fish than right off the resort beach, in my opinion.

W/ the price of our unit, we knew that we had to sit through a timeshare presentation which we weren't so excited about doing. 5 days in to our trip we met w/ Chuck and he knew that we had no intentions of purchasing. We never misled Chuck to thinking that we were ever interested in purchasing. As a result, we were fast tracked in our presentation w/in 1 hour.

However, we noticed a musty smell and thought that the room had not been used for awhile. We proceeded to open the sliding doors to 'air out' the room. After setting up the room and enjoying the view on the lanai we closed the doors and went to dinner. Returning to our room we could still detect the odor, but dismissed it as a minor inconvenience. I went to the bedroom to setup my laptop and while waiting for it to power up I looked to my right and saw a long black streak coming from the vent. The streak was ~five feet in length and the width of the vent starting at the vent and continuing over the bed. Needless to say, I was not pleased and called the front desk. I was informed that a maintenance man would come up and look at the 'problem'. He arrived and looked at the black swath and said, \"That doesn't look good .... I will have to talk with the manager\". After waiting 30 minutes, I proceeded to the front desk. The desk clerk stated that she had talked with the manager. I asked why I had not received a call. I was given no reply. I asked what they were going to do because I was NOT going to sleep in a bed with a 5 foot swath of black mold on the ceiling. Desk clerk said that they could not do anything that night because they were overbooked. I replied that was not acceptable and she stated that she had been given authorization by the manager to give me a $50 credit. Again, I replied that was not acceptable because we were NOT going to sleep in that room. After a few similar exchanges the desk clerk said she would call the manager again. After another 10 minutes she returned stating again that they were overbooked but the manager would try to find us accomodations at another resort.

I replied that if they were overbooked how did they now find a room and asked to have the manager call us. As expected, I never received any call from anyone for the entire duration of the stay (one week). The resort is a former Embassy Suites that was sold to Diamond Resorts. The resort lacks the ambience expected from an oceanside, Hawaiian resort. It is in a state of slow deterioration .... no decorations, areas that used to house Embassy Suites activities e.g., manager's reception, restaurants, etc., are left vacant or sparsely occupied. The pool is a cement slab that has no appearance of anything tropical. Other than providing a 'unit' the resort offers little more than just a room.

The hotel was kept up very nicely, clean, and safe feeling, with fast elevators and easy self parking. THE POOL - was warm and clean with plenty of beach chairs to be had. We have stayed in other places where if you dont have a towel on a chair by 8am you are out of luck, Not true here although people to reserve their chairs early which I dont think they are supposed to do. The ambience by the pool was low key and the evening very nice with Hawaiin music (live) played from the restaurant on the terrace. Tiki torches and waterfalls made the experience as well. I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU AVOID THE BUFFET. It was gross and worse than most continental breakfasts you eat at lower end hotels. The omelet station was the only saving grace but even then they didnt have very many ingredients to choose from). The rest of the buffet was nothing worth mentioning. Hashbrowns were deep fried jo jo type potatos cut up (like jack in the box). GROSS. Even at 15 this was not worth it. Subsequently we did not eat anywhere else on the property. Across the street there is a place called Pizza Paradiso - They had awesome breakfast burritos (grab and go) for 4.95 and were quite filling. Cheap, filling, and portable for on the way to the beach. TIMESHARE- They do try to bombard you as soon as you check in by telling you they have to complete your reservation....you then walk to a desk where they start in. I immediately told them no and they seemed to respect that although they called later in the week promising a 3 day free stay at their resorts for taking a \"survey\". PLEASE. We didnt do that either. I saw a couple in the elevator obviously on a timeshare tour and they looked like they were being held hostage. No thanks. The KBC does charge for local phone calls - and do not advertise that - so beware. THE BEACH - is nice out front but not for swimming. We saw people kiteboarding on windy days and others snorkeling occasionally but an employee told us that there are bad riptides and showed us warning flags and buoys. Needless to say we didnt go farther in than our knees. Maybe this is just the case in the winter? All told we would definately go back to this condo.

When our travel agent booked this hotel we were told we would have to sit through the timeshare pitch. We prepared ourselves mentally, but what we encountered was beyond our worst expectations. We were on one of the top floors with an ocean view. It was nice, large and clean. The grounds are beautiful. We were escorted to \"VIP services\" after we checked in. There is nothing \"VIP\" about it. This is where they take a calendar out and try and get you to sign up for all the excursions the hotel as to offer. This is also where they sign you up for the 2 hour (but it was really almost 3) timeshare pitch. We didnt think we had a choice, and had to say yes. But I think you can say No. DO THIS! Its NOT WORTH the $100 voucher. NOT WORTH IT! We were bummed that you had to pay $16 for parking, but a car is necessary in Maui. We chose to do the \"pitch\" two days into our stay. We were greeted by an aggressive guy named Kai. He basically grilled us and harassed us for 3 hours. He was \"intrigued\" in why we had a nice room on one of the top floors since normally they are reserved for \"special members.\" We basically told him straight out that we were not interested in buying. He became very angry because it was his \"day off.\" Stopped filling in questions, started to ask questions and then said \"you know what, it doesnt even matter...rather you buy or not, I am still going to make money.\" He was a jerk to say the least. He told us the reason he got a divorce was because he didnt take a vacation w his wife. He then basically told us that this would surely happen to us if we didnt sign up for our \"guaranteed vacation.\" The manager then came over- we thought this is where we could sign out, but no! The manager basically said we would end in divorce as well if we didnt guarantee a vacation. Telling honeymooners they will get divorced is not a great sales pitch. It was honestly the worst part of our vacation. We then felt like outsiders, since they basically told us we did not belong there since we were not members. After they FINALLY (3 hours- THREE!!) let us sign out, and then we sent us out to another sales lady who tried one more time to get us to sign. We also had to rate everything and lied because we were afraid of the repercussions. I would only stay here again if we didnt have to go through the sales pitch.

The pizzas are really good and a small pizza fed the other three people. The pool is always nice and warm and offers a section for children. This was my main concern: We were given some tickets to the luau and since one of our party had never been to a luau we decided to buy another one so all of us could go. The food was great...the show was extremely amateurish. The performers were mostly grade school/middle school aged children and I found it hard to watch them \"shake their coconuts\".

We stayed as a trade with our Disney property through Interval. While the room was spacious (bathroom is huge) and clean, this was not a fair trade IMO. This resort does not have washer/dryer units in each property and that is a real disappointment to me. I just don't understand why a timeshare wouldn't have that. That is one of the selling points of a Timeshare. Also, with baggage fees as they are these days, you want to be able to pack less and wash more. This would totally stop me from buying here. Also, there is not a full kitchen, just a kitchenette. No stove or oven. While that matters less to me than the lack of washer/dryer, it is still an issue. Timeshare people do like to know they have those amenities. Sometimes we like to buy a frozen pizza for the kids and that can't be done. The property is pink as other reviews have mentioned. It could be classed up a bit with another color. The lobby has potential as does the entire property. It just needs a facelift. The rooms are ok; some of the furniture is tired.

It is priced well and the drinks are great. We ate our best meal our last night at the resort. Anyway, Maui is marvelous. Perfect in every way. And the Ka'anapali Beach Club is a tribute to those qualities. Stay here, you won't regret it. We hope to return many times.

They offered us a \"sampler\" whereby we paid about 900 US to stay a week at the Kaanapali Beach Club anytime in the next 18 months. I called a week before we decided to go and had no problem getting in for the dates we wanted. The resort is in a great location, as others have noted. Kaanapali is my favorite place in Maui, touristy enough but not in the city. The resort has lovely grounds. The pool is nice. I was hesitant to hit the ocean as I thought it looked rough, but it was great and if you snorkel out by the buoys, there is decent visibility - my husband was out there most days for at least a couple of hours. The desk staff were friendly - not overly so - but certainly accomodating. We didn't have to pay for parking. I don't know if this applies to everyone or not. I certainly did miss pool side service for drinks, but it saved the temptation of having a nice blender drink so saved us some money! Room was good. We have been in better, but it was nice. Good size. Full fridge. Terrible view - our ocean view was a bit of ocean and looking down was a cheesy mini-golf course. Patio was really small. We didn't sit out there at all. And there was some sort of generator out there so it was really noisy all the time. That said, not every room can have a perfect view and we spent so little time in the room, who cares?! The room was musty & smelled yucky. We complained at the front desk and were advised that we needed to keep our A/C on all the time due to the moisture in the air. It makes sense, everything is damp all the time, but it was too bad. I would have loved to have the fresh air and breeze...but we turned our A/C back on...and once you are in the room for a bit the smell kind of fades away...we did buy some Febreeze and spray is daily and that helped some, but only temporarily. This is the one and only reason I say we would stay somewhere else, like a condo - it would be nice to be somewhere quiet so we could open our windows and night and hear the ocean, and then wake up to fresh smells... Definitely recommend the Farmers Market just a little bit north for produce - the grocery store across the street is really pricey. The gelato at Pizza Paradiso across the street is amazing! And you must go to CJ's - just a little south torwards Lahaina - for lunch & or dinner. Really yummy. It is just before the overpass in the little shopping village past the golf course on your right. Oh, finally, the timeshare presentation experience. We had to go as part of contract for the \"sampler\" we were a part of. The girl who met us was the most informative and friendly of any we have ever been to. She was not pushy in any way and was easy going. That is, until we said no. Then she just closed up.

There is a wonderful dive shop on site. It has finally made the Diamond web-site. You can dive and snorkel right from the resort beach area. They even do \"reminders\" in the hotel pool every day. We discovered on day 3 that if you have the balcony door or front door open at all the A/C is OFF. As we left the flip lock in the door to allow our friends easy access we got pretty warm. Valet was fast. Our friends had free parking so we did not have to pay the daily fee, just tips. Housekeeping for us was one time as we time share traded. They did a nice job. Our friends had a problem with housekeeping taking the extra coffee filters but the front desk came through and replaced. The key to this resort is \"ask the front desk\" they will take care of it.... There is a towel exchange - works well and you don't have to use your own beach towel at the resort. Restaurant on site is tasty and priced about $$. It is a resort on Maui. There is a grocery within walking distance - eggs were almost $6 for 12, it also sells beer, wine and hard liquor (a shock for us Texans). The resort does not have full kitchens, however we asked and they provided us with a large electric skillet, crock pot and a blender. Toaster, microwave, fridge, sink and dishwasher are room standard. There is a Costco near the airport, a stop there on the way is smart, especially for beer, wine and liquor - you may have to get the large one but it costs a lot less than the small one at the grocery. We, of course, attended the time share update, no hard sell at all. We already own in Lake Tahoe and are happy with what we have, we got the update and sat around for 1/2 hour as you must stay there in the presentation area for the full 90 minutes to get your gift.

Actually, we looked over the mini golf course, and could see ocean, hotels and even a bit of the mountains. The room was great, very large, clean. There were tons of extra pillows and towels, and we did not run out of towels even with four of us, and there being room service only once during our stay.

The pool area was lovely, and everything always looked very clean. The beach is very nice, though I prefer the south end of Ka'anapali. There are a bunch of rocks as well as some reef just off the beach which, combined with the somewhat rough water, made it a poor choice for swimming. The red warning flag (meaning high surf/do not go in water) was flying our entire trip; I wonder if they ever change this? The beach was fine for wading/splashing or lounging. We only ate at the restaurant twice, and it was fine. My one complaint: the orange juice tasted canned. At a place like this I expect fresh, or at least refrigerated juice, but canned o.j. tastes nasty! We never did use the snack bar, as when we wanted to do so it was either closed or too busy; they need a better system or more help there. We used valet parking the entire trip, which was a good decision for us.

There is a separate kiddy pool with water slide, a hot tub and another small pool with waterfall which was really only useful for picture taking.

My wife & I & 2 boys age 13 & 10 had a great stay & I wanted to post some things about our trip as in planning my trips I have found these reviews to help me so here's hoping I can help someone in return. We left just before the tropical storm Felicia was scheduled to move closer & provide needed rain so our weather was picture perfect except for some extra wind in Kaanapali that was unusual but easily tolerated & helpful to stay cool versus hot sun pounding on us. We were reminded the very 1st day about Hawaii's sun when my wife forgot to sun block the boys & our youngest got red but we just coated his face from there on & made him wear a shirt. The KBC is being actively renovated & I saw some good improvements. New astro turf on the mini-golf, Pool was already redone, rooms were updated & still the best deal around for space in a condo. There is still lots of room for improvements as they still have only one restaurant open & space is wasted for the other restaurant areas. The Teen club had Wii, guitar hero & playstaion & my kids discovered this on the 3rd to last day so thankfully they did not waste Hawaii time on video games. Valet guys are great & worth the $13/day parking & a few extra dollars when they bring the car. Very conveinent. Beach is great & inner tubes & boogie boards available if desired. Snorkeling is fair but I did see 2 turtles in the water from land in the evening & morning crusing the beach 20 feet from shore. Everyone is extremely nice even the consierge girl when I informed her we had booked our excursions direct. On our tours we did Molikin on Quicksilver. THis boat is great if you desire shade as almost all areas are inside. WE have done this tour before & you eventually get beat down by the hot hawaii sun when you are in it for 6 hours. Snorkel at Honalua bay for free & it is not the 180 ft clarity like Molikini but you can get 3 feet from turtles if you stay calm & relaxed & not chase them as most people do. We did that exactly & it was quite a site until the others rushed in causing the turtle to dive & disappear in a cave. Facing the cove the right side is better but the left is also good especially the cliff wall area & caves in fron of them. We did Fleming beach w/boogie boards & it was a blast. I got sand everywhere on my body but is was worth it as my youngest learned to bb & he was very happy atfer riding a dozen or more waves. This park is great w/picnic facilities, shade, bathrms & showers. Only about 5-10 minutes from KBC as well. Honalua bay was extrordinary as we spent 2 morns hee snorkeling one side 1 day for about 1&1/2 hrs & then did the other side the next day. The beach is all rock & say hi to Jimmy the land owner next door. He likes to think he can tell everyone what to do but he is harmless & does live next door & I am sure he has had some vandals at his place. WE drove the road to Hana, each & everyone of the 57 one lane bridges & I forgot how beautiful that drive is. It has to be one of the top 10 scenic places in the world. The 7 sacred pools is great for fresh water swimming & hiking but no snorkeling. The park rangers will stop you from cliff jumping so get it in quick before they tell you no. Call the highway dept as they are currently building retaining wall nets during the week causing som long delays. We luckily went on the weekend when they donot work. You can also drive completely around coming out at the winery & again seeing some great extra views & the rugged eastern south coastline. This is an all day event so plan for you kids. We also spoofed our kids later in the week saying we were going to do the Road to Hana again only to surprise them w/a helicopter ride which is alos great but pricey. They best part was our kids reaction to doing the road again. Priceless. Haleakala is also great but we saved it for our last day & had limited time. I saw some people riding horseback out of it. Next time I will go into the volcano on horseback to save my old knees the hike. Lahaina & the banyon tree are still a beautiful calming place. THe pioneer n is fine for a reasonable 12$ fish lunch or dinner. Bj's pizza is great but takes 45 minutes. Put your name down & walk around. Worth it. Bubba gump shrimp is ok & very fast. Drinks at most other place all around are still only about $5 & I am from Dallas where drinks are running 7-9$ so I am ok w/$5. Shops are shops & it is still fun to eat & cruise the main drag & get an ice cream. Oh to be young & go spend a year or at least a summer there without a care. Last was our Lua at the SHeraton wher they have a Don Ho type guy that is good but I heard the Hyatt has a better Lua with more excitement & drums. Last is that Hawaii has gone smokeless. Our hotel was smoke free all resaturants are smoke free, dinner cruises are smoke free, Lua's are smoke free. ANything that has to do w/public dining is smoke free.

We finally opted to just sleep with the lanai doors open and call it good (we were on 7th floor) Suggestions: rent your snorkel & ocean gear in town- we really like Boss Frog's or Snorkel Bob's.

She booked us a deluxe ocean view suite. The unit is very comfortably arranged with ample seating in the living room, a small dining room table with four chairs, and a roomy bedroom with nice bedding on the king-size bed. The bathroom is very oversized with a separate tub and shower. The large bedroom closet opens into the bathroom also. Maid service only comes on the fourth and last day. This was a little inconvenient. Luckily there are lots of extra towels in the closet. The travel-size toiletries are not replenished unless you make the request. Since you can't fly with larger toiletries, I picked up items I needed at the nearby Long's Drugs. Our white water view was lovely, and the balcony had two chairs and two lounge chairs. We enjoyed watching the sunset on a lounge chair on the lawn adjacent to the beach. KBC has a luau that provided a nice ambience on one of the nights with live music and Hawaiian dancing. The luau is $60 a person if you want to actually participate in the meal, but otherwise, the music provides a very nice background to your sunset cocktails. On another night, they set up an outdoor movie. The pool is large and nicely landscaped with ample padded lounge chairs. The hot tub is tiny in relation to the rest of the facility. The beach is very nice, with a slightly steep incline into the water. Farther up the coast toward Napili/Kapalua, there are amazing snorkel locations and beautiful beaches to explore. Back towards downtown Lahaina, Black Rock is the place to be for snorkeling. There were a variety of stores and restaurants in close driving proximity. We hit Long's Drugs a couple of times, and it's attached to a small mall with a small food court that is a good change of pace if you want something quick to eat there or take back to your suite. Extra daily charges include parking ($13), Internet ($10), and room tax ($5). Although this property seeks to be an upscale 4-star resort, the slightly shabby condition of the furniture, the little smudges and single splatter of food in the microwave, and the mismatched toiletries with limited maid service do detract from this image.

The resort is easy to locate and about a 45 minute drive from the airport. If you are from a big city and use to a lot of light at night driving you will be amazed at how dark, dark is in the middle of the Pacific driving at night, but it is not a bad drive. The lobby is very nice and well maintianed. It's great to just sit in the large open air lobby and people watch. On friday night they have a large outside projector and screen in the pool area and show family friendly movies. I thought this was great and the kids seamed to really enjoy it. The hotel is not brand new but it is fairly well maintained. The grounds were very nice and it is directly on the beach. While we were there they closed the restaurant because of renovations. This was for safety as the restaurant was located right next to the pool area which was being resurfaced. I don't believe it is permanent as alluded to in other posts. Our room was great. We had a a \"Deluxe Ocean Front\" and the view was outstanding. Fortunately there was no rain at all while we were there and we spent time out on the balcony watching wind surfers, whales and sail boats while relaxing. The room was nicely furnished and the bed was comfortable. The bath was very large and all was very clean. There is not a full kitchen but this did not bother us. There is a large ridge and good size microwave. We didn't come to Maui to cook in the room. The location is great with easy access to all the west side of Maui has to offer. There are many other resorts in the area and we spent time at the Sheraton and Wyndham. The Wyndham has a great breakfast restaurant right on the beach and it is a great walk over. the Shara ton's black rock ceremony is free and not to be missed at sunset. The pool was being resurfaced during part of our stay so we used the beach instead. Once it is resurfaced I think it will be much improved. The setting is very nice and it is easy to keep an eye on kids. Overall there were not a large number of children when we were there and the pool was very pleasant while it was open. The one thing I didn't like was having to pay for parking, I think it was 11 bucks a day. If you take the \"time share tour\" you get a voucher you can use for parking costs. I didn't avail myself of this opportunity as $100 bucks is not enough to go through one of those! They have Valet parking at no EXTRA cost and the valet staff is first rate, very friendly and helpful. I spent so much time getting info from the valet staff about places to go and good local places to eat that I believe the 100 was well spent. Everything considered the hotel was not perfect. However we generally don't expect perfection. The resort was clean, the staff was very helpful, the room was very nice and frankly more then we expected.

Before Diamond Resorts took over the management (two trips ago), we used to love this place, but Diamond is ruining our once-fabulous home away from home! We felt the difference the first time we walked into the lobby after Diamond took over. The warm ohana feel was gone, replaced by a cold corporate sales atmosphere. Our personable helpful concierges (who used to search out the best deals on the island and give great personal service) had been replaced by unknowledgeable Expedia employees who just wanted to sell us what they had to offer, and didn't care about our interests. The welcome breakfast, which used to be a lovely full buffet with fresh omelets, where we learned about the best activity \"deals\" on the island, had been replaced by dry rolls, coffee and a sales pitch. (No wonder hardly anyone attends these any more.) The owner discounts for booking through the concierge were gone. (Expedia had the nerve to tell us that the discounts had been incorporated into their regular prices, but a simple price comparison showed that this was a lie. How stupid do they think we are?) The free daily cocktail receptions, which used to be great community-building events, were gone. Daily trash pick up had been eliminated. (They told us that if our trash needed to go out, to put it in the atrium walkway outside our room for guests on all 12 floors to see. This is not only incredibly tacky, it is a violation of the house rules.) To decrease trust of Diamond even further, these reductions in service have been accompanied by HUGE increases in maintenance fees. Our fairly new (and perfectly fine) bedding had been replaced by creepy feeling POLYESTER SHEETS and ugly dark brown accents in this TROPICAL CLIMATE. Whose dumb idea was that?? Obviously not someone who had to actually sleep (or rather, toss, turn and sweat) on those sheets. (Oh, I see. The sheets have a diamond pattern woven into the fabric--all the better to be reminded who is responsible for these decisions.) Aside from the corporate atmosphere and horrible management decisions, the building and grounds are as nice as in the pre-Diamond days. Right on the beach with snorkeling (and turtles!) steps away. Whales out front, in season. Large suites with huge bathrooms, beautiful wooden furnishings. The kitchen appears limited, but we have found that the full fridge, microwave, electric skillet (obtained free from housekeeping) and beachside BBQs are adequate for a two-week stay without our eating out once. (Additional kitchen supplies--like a decent corkscrew, better knives, a blender, etc--would be nice.) For those who are confused by all the pink--this color is of historic significance. It is a particular pink that was used by Hawaiian royalty and is meant to honor traditional Hawaiian culture. I don't understand the recent comments about outdated furnishings. A few years ago, the rooms were all upgraded with granite counters, fresh paint, new drapes, new tile in kitchen and bath and elegant tropical furnishings. The gold carpet that one reviewer said looked like it was from the 80's was actually installed after 2005. The grounds and koi ponds are beautiful. They still have the torch lighting at sunset. The pool resurfacing in April 2009 was completed over a month early(!), so we who came in late May expecting no pool were pleasantly surprised to find it ready. I hope that Diamond Resorts straightens up their act and starts making policies for the benefit of the owners and guests, rather than for Diamond. Bring back our warm friendly resort! I've heard lots of owners complain mightily, which is a really bad sign. Also, Diamond has changed the sales policies so that I would NEVER buy from them. They do not sell deeded property like we purchased. (One can still buy it directly from owners.) Instead they sell interests in a trust controlled by--who else?--Diamond Resorts.

First of all, the pool renovations didn't affect us at all - they seem to be resurfacing the pool itself, there was no noise, most work seemed to be done while we were out exploring during the day, and nothing other than the pool itself was closed (at the time - your experience may differ!). As we were leaving, they did close the outdoor patio portion of the restaurant/bar due to the actual painting of the pool surface which they expected to cause a bit of a mess, but from what I gathered this was only for a few days so if you're reading this you shouldn't catch it. We used an Interval International timeshare exchange for a room and were generally pleased with the result. A few notes, though: * Parking is $13/day, and Hawaii Occupancy Tax is $5/day. These are waived if you're a Diamond Resorts timeshare owner, but you have to pay them if you're doing an interval exchange. This is more than a little ridiculous - if you're exchanging with another owner you should get all the benefits that owner is exchanging. I didn't appreciate this obvious money grab by the resort. * Despite the pool renovations, I'd actually recommend staying on the pool side of the building, as there's an air conditioning unit or some kind of generator on the other side which makes quite a bit of noise - enough that we closed the doors at night. * The \"Concierge\" at the resort is actually an obviously for-profit separate entity, called \"Expedia Local Experts\". They are very helpful, but definitely interested in booking you as many activities as possible - I'm quite certain the staff there get a cut of absolutely everything they book, and I can't count how many times I was asked to do a timeshare presentation, I imagine they get a large payment for that. We enjoyed most of the activities, but at their insistence we booked a bus trip to Hana rather than driving it ourselves. They told us that day was the last day the road out of hana was open, but their information was wrong and the road had already closed - this meant rather than doing a loop of the island we drove twice along a nauseating 617 hairpin turn road, and missed many of the better sights. I don't recommend driving to hana as long as the road out is closed, and I am extremely displeased with expedia for their false information and failure to rectify the situation afterwards. * Happy hour is 5-7, but only 3 of their signature cocktails are available for $4 - Pina Colada, Mai Tai, and Lava Flow. The Lava Flow at this resort is the best I had on this trip (it's a strawberry/banana pina colada), it's made with a deliciously hefty amount of real bananas and real cream. The Mai Tai is deadly strong. We had one of each every day we were around during happy hour. Still, it's a downer that their other drinks aren't discounted as much - Suite Sunset is delicious as well. * Walking to the nearest out-of-resort beachside restaurant in Whalers Village does take over an hour, even if you're a young, energetic person you won't want to do it every day. Fish at beachside restaurants on Maui is generally very overpriced (especially with current CAD/USD exchange rates ... $34 turns into $42 and that seems like way too much for a fish that was caught locally. There's a couple plate lunch/dinner restaurants in Lahaina that serve good portions of mahi mahi and other catches for $8 though - look for the cheaper places outside of the area near the port where the cruise ships stop. Bussing to Whaler's village (for $2) is convenient, the stop is next to this resort, but last bus back is $8 so expect to cab back for $14-15 (with tip) a couple times. That's about it for the resort. We had some great experiences on Maui worth mentioning though! * Pacific Whale Foundation runs some awesome, and relatively cheap snorkelling trips - we did the Molokai and Lanai trip for about $65. It includes the equipment, breakfast and lunch (we had pastries, juice and coffee for breakfast, and bbq chicken breasts and hot dogs with pasta salad for lunch), and open bar on the boat after the second snorkelling trip with a good selection of drinks. I *highly* recommend this trip, it was informative and fun. * Surfing in Lahaina - also awesome. We went with a company that gives you a free rental after the 2 hour class. Unfortunately the surf was out that afternoon after the class, and we were leaving the next day so we couldn't make use of it (they offered to give us a free rental the next day instead as they were closing due to the lack of waves) - I recommend you call them directly and ask when they suggest you do it, and do it early in your trip because you WILL want to do it again. They guarantee you will stand (and they're not kidding, you will probably stand on your first try with their tips), and the waves in Lahaina are some of the best in the world to learn on. * Booking activities in Lahaina seems to be far cheaper than through anywhere else. We were bombarded with offers of helicopter rides for $100 per person (this was definitely legit, even though it was at least double through expedia - they were just trying to fill empty seats for the next day), and crazier things like Luaus for $15, etc... I suggest looking into this before booking with the \"concierge\".", "Date": "May 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cWish we would have known\u201d", "Author": "Dirtbag35", "ReviewID": "UR28980487", "Content": "We were not informed by Robert - email address [--] - that we would not have access to use the pool during our stay.

All of the one bedrooms are suites regardless of view category. These suites are 820 square feet which is about twice the size of a hotel room. Most of the suites have been upgraded with new furnishings and flat screen tvs. Embassy Suites is no longer involved in this resort which is why the daily free happy hour is gone. Sure, it was great, but who else does it? It was supported by the sales department and now that the resort is 97% sold out, they discontinued it. Same reason they discontined the daily breakfast buffet. Thats just a fact. The good news is that this is an ocean front resort with large suites, kitchen, a wonderful staff and reasonable rates. All of the lounge chairs around the one acre pool have been replaced with nice padded lounges and there are many of them, so you don't have to race to the pool at 9:00 AM to save one.

We just returned after spending a week there, as we have done annually for the past 6 or 7 years. We were very disappointed with what is happening to this resort. Diamond has done away with most of the amenities that made the KBC a \"gold crown\" resort. Last year they stopped serving the breakfast buffet and did away with the daily afternoon complimentary cocktail reception. This year we found that the North Beach Grille (a nice, on-site restaurant) had been shuttered. The only \"restaurant\" at the resort is a fast-food snack bar that is real tacky. This year, as another cost savings measure to boost profits at the expense of the guests, they did away with the daily pick-up of the trash and garbage in the rooms. As a result of the maids not picking it up, frustrated guests merely bagged or boxed it up and threw it out into the hallways. We saw piles of trash that sometimes sat in the halls for more than 24 hours. To compound our disappointment, we encountered a flea infestation in our room. After finding and killing several of the critters, we informed the front desk. We were advised that the room would be \"treated\" ASAP. The ball was dropped, and this never happened. We continued finding several more fleas during our stay. Upon returning home, I wrote a letter to Diamond's CEO. I got a phone call from an employee who, after calling again once she completed her \"investigation\", advised me that what we found were not fleas, but more likely, \"seasonal fruit flies!\" This was a total insult to me intelligence as I'm 65 years old and I know big, ugly fleas when I see them!!!! It's a real shame what Diamond is doing to this once fine resort. I truly cannot give it anywhere near as high a rating as previous reviewers have.

Since we were coming to KBC from another hotel, they arrived at 1:30PM which is before the 4PM check-in time. They notified the front desk that they were there and asked if their room might be ready. \"No, but we'll call your cell phone when it is ready.\" When you get that reply, you sort of assume that they'll notify housekeeping to get room # whatever ready because the guests are on property. This does NOT happen at KBC. At 4PM, they were given the key to the room but when they went up to the room, they found out that the maid had not yet cleaned the room. In fact, she didn't finish cleaning the room until 5:30PM. Not good! We had an extra night at our other hotel so we didn't get to KBC until the next morning. Since we'd planned an early morning snorkel at Black Rock, we arrived at KBC at 8:30AM and let the front desk know we were on property and could they call us when our room was ready. \"Oh yes.\" Usual response. We told them what had happened to our daughter's family the previous day and they assured us that this would not happen again. Though we kept checking at the front desk all afternoon, we were always told that our room was not ready. Finally, when we went up at 3:45PM, they said the room was ready. It seems that there is not communication between their housekeeping department and the front desk. It is such an easy problem to fix and would sure make a big difference in the attitude of the guests if communication did exist. Our room, and our daughter's were just great. They had a \"recently renovated\" room (floors 2, 3 and 10 are \"recently renovated\") with the flat screen TV's and newer furniture and we had an older \"renovated room without the flat screen TV's. It was fine. The beds and bedding in both rooms were new and in good condition and comfortable. I agree with a previous reviewer that the kitchen utinsels are insufficient. We had two formerly sharp knives that guests had used as screw drivers or something. It would be nice if they'd put an electric skillet in all rooms but we made do with just the microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher. There is 1 coin-op washer and dryer on all even numbered floors. They worked fine. Ice is on the odd numbered floors. The pool was fine but we understand it is about to be shut down for a month to renovate that plus the kiddie slide.. We never had a problem finding available chairs or towels. Though the KBC does have a ridiculous \"towel pass.\" When you check in you are given one towel pass per guest which you are supposed to give to the towel hut by the pool in exchange for a towel. You are told there will be a $50 charge per towel if you don't turn in the proper number of towels. This isn't really true and is a dumb way to try to control towel theft. I am not sure who would want to steal even one old, worn out pink towel. One amenity we've used before is their showers in the men's and women's restrooms on the lower level for after you've checked out and are waiting for a nighttime flight. Though the men's shower was \"out of order\", the women's was great. They even provide a nice changing room and a hair dryer. Parking in the self-park garage is excellent. There is no need to do valet parking. Overall, this hotel is slightly above average and a good benefit for families with kids because of the size of the rooms.

Overall, this resort and location were a disappontment. First the good points - nice beach and pool area. Decent restaurant for lunch. Spacious bedroom and bathroom. What we didn't like - the balcony is so narrow it is basically useless. We had just spent a week on Kauai, where we returned to our suite each day and drank wine from the balcony as we watched the sun set. Most of the rooms at KBC have no view of the sun setting and the small balcony makes the rooms with a view less enjoyable. In fact, my husband and I took wine down to the beach area on two evenings and watched the sun set. On each occasion, we looked back at the hotel and no one was on the balcony enjoying the beautiful sunset. Why? You would have to stand the entire time. There is only one restaurant. We were told the nicer restaurant closed this past year due to lack of use (revenue did not cover costs to keep it running). Except for the good pizza place in the strip mall across the street, you need to drive everywhere for dinner. Since we had a car, it was not a big inconvenience, but quite different from staying in the middle of Kaanapli or Kaapalua. In the evenings on previous trips, we would take nice strolls along the beach or in the resort area. However, KBC is in a very crowded area and there is no feel of Hawaii when you are walking around the resort. The pool area is nice, but the slide is for children only and the hot tub was co-opted by parents and their small children while we were there. No matter what time we went to the pool, there were always a few parents and kids in the hot tub. To be honest, I don't feel comfortable in the same hot tob with kids in diapers. Probably would feel differently if the children were mine, but they weren't. Don't bother making any activity arrangements through the concierge. There is no discount and it takes a long time. We bought two excursions through them. The first, a Lanai Golf trip had no flexibility in dates whatsoever, which was problematic when we had 40 hour gusts that morning. However, if we had scheduled directly with the trip provider, we could have switched to another day for no fee, as long as they had availability. The second excursion was to a magic show. Although the show was fine, it took two days and three trips to the concierge desk to get our tickets. Again, no discount, so we could have just booked directly with the show. Fianlly, there is a little too much pressure to buy a timeshare. I finally had to say - We are on vacation, don't call us anymore. This resort is showing its age. Although they are fixing up the rooms, the common areas are worn looking and don't have that Hawaiian feel at all.", "Date": "March 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, OK", "Title": "\u201cWonderful vacation and friendly staff but outdated\u201d", "Author": "Serenity_9", "ReviewID": "UR26035682", "Content": "We just returned yesterday March 10th from a 10-day stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Club.

I generally do not write reviews of our trips or resorts. However, we had an unexpected great time at the hotel, I thought I would share some of our experiences and notes. I read most of the recent reviews on tripadvisor about KBC before I left. I got a good idea of the hotel as well as some of the perks. We've been to Maui multiple times, but this was our first time at KBC. Our trip was truly enjoyable and relaxing. We were one of the unfortunate travelers to Maui who had no rental car. I booked with Advantage Rental Car 6 months before our trip. However, 2 days before we left to the island I got an e-mail from them stating they closed shop and thus, I have no rental car for the week. I spent 48 hours on the phone as well as the internet looking for a car. There were literally no cars available to rent. We had to make it to the whole week at the resort without a car. We certainly didn't want not having a car ruin our trip. On the contrary, our trip was just fine. KBC is a resort that one can stay for the week and not go nuts. We had an ocean front 1-BR room on the second floor (room #210). Not only were we able to see beautiful sunsets from our balcony, but also countless whales jumping out of the water everyday. Both experiences were magical. We couldn't have asked for a better room. Every night, we had the ocean waves put us to sleep. Every morning, we had the beautiful blue skies wake us up. As stated in the previous reviews, our 1-BR room was huge, plenty big for the four of us (me, my wife, and our two sons, ages 4 and 6). The bathroom was gigantic. Everything was updated. My sons watched cartoons on the flatscreen tv in the livingroom and we watched movies on our flatscreen tv in our bedroom. We cooked breakfast in our kitchen every morning. We asked for a hot skillet. We cooked pancakes, eggs, french toasts, etc in the mornings. For the most part, lunch and dinner we ate at the hotel's restaurant. The food at the hotel restaurant was amazing. Not only was it a great deal (especially for the kids at $2 for a cheeseburger and fries, hotdog and fries, pizza, etc), but the food was very good. We ordered the BBQ ribs four nights in a row. The meat was so tender and soft, it just fell off the bone. The sauce was very tasty. In fact, it was better than the ones at Kimos. We had lunch at Kimos one day and compared the two. KBC won hands down. People said Kimo's was an awesome place to see sunset. We thought take-out food from the hotel restaurant and eating in our room with the view was truly amazing and to die for. In fact, we did this several times and it was much better than any restaurant in Maui. The restaurant's prices were cheaper than most good restaurants in Lahaina. The resort also had minature golf where we spent an enjoyable afternoon playing with the kids. However, the best time was spent on the beach. The beach was right outside the hotel and next to the swimming pool. We would make sandcastles and then to the pool and hottub. We thought it was very nice having our own beach and pool next to each other, it was truly easy and pleasant. On this trip, we spent time at the Westin resort hotel as well as Kaanapali Beach Hotel pools with our friends who were there at the same time. The Westin has a great pool, but their single small hottub was for adults only. Kaanapali Beach Hotel didn't have a hottub. Needless to say, my boys enjoyed KBC pools/hottub/beach much better (including our friends). The workout facilities were free. It had both weights and aerobic machines. We never had to wait for anything. Parking was free to the timeshare owners. In fact, we heard it was free for both valet as well as self-parking. Of course, we didn't experience it first hand since we had no rental car. Within a short 5 minute walk was a supermarket. The prices in the supermarket were better than the Safeway in Lahaina. We bought a gallon of milk for $5 as well as food and drinks for the whole week. The refrigirator in our room was plenty big. We could store a whole week's of food and drinks without any problems. We also had washer and dryer down the hall to do laundry in the middle of the week. All in all, we were very happy with KBC. The place, views, and facilities were perfect for us. We couldn't have asked for anything more in a luxury hotel. We're looking forward in going back to Maui and KBC, but next time, with a rental car.", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cPink\u201d", "Author": "Grotbo", "ReviewID": "UR24345181", "Content": "We got the scenic room, meaning non ocean view, on the cheap for one week in January 2009.

It was only two weeks before we arrived that we actually got a confirmation number for the timeshare plus itself. So in the end it all worked out.

For the price of a one bedroom it is hard to complain, but if I was paying a larger amount or traded in an expensive resort to this place I would have been disappointed. Good: Grills are nice although sometimes difficult to light. Get cooking utensils from front desk. Free water is available pool side and various locations. Bathroom is huge and has good layout with two separate sinks (one vanity and one pedestal). Rice cooker is available from housekeeping for no extra charge. Tons of towels provided for in the room.

You can self-park or valet park, but either way, it's $15/night. There's no open parking at this resort. (A nuisance BUT you also don't see cars anywhere on the property, which gives it a more relaxed resort feel.) - If the noise from the pool or construction is a problem, ask for a room on the other side...they are scenic too, but you will not see a sunset.

Once for my honeymoon in 2005, once as a family trip with my parents and grandparents in 2006, and the most recent was last October just with a friend for my birthday. I am going again in March 2009. The hotel: The hotel is a few minutes north of the main beach in Ka'anapali on it's own little beach with 2 other hotels, so you can lay out and it's not super crowded. It's big and pink which is good because it looks distinctly different from the other hotels, and you can easily spot it on the way. The grounds are beautiful and it sits right in the sand. There are two restaurants, but I have only eaten at the bar/grill which is poolside and ocean front. The food is okay, they have a good pulled pork quesadilla... There used to be a happy hour with free drinks and a guy singing/playing guitar 4-6, but that is no more. Now they have drink specials. All of the staff at the hotel is extremely friendly and helpful. We had one problem and I will tell more about that in the rooms, but it was handled well. There are 3 banks of elevators, and sometimes there is a wait for one, but the others are close by, so you can just walk over to another one if yours is taking too long. I did not go to the timeshare presentation myself, but my parents did. I have been to the presentation in Avila Beach, CA and my parents said that the representative was a little snippy when they asked about incentives for signing (they had previously been given roundtrip plane tickets when signing) and she basically told them that they weren't hurting for business there so they didn't need to offer such incentives. However, we got a few free luau tickets because they went on the tour, so it was worth it for us. Other than that, I've had NO bad experiences with staff. The rooms: The 1 bedrooms are very spacious. The bathrooms are huge with a stand-up shower and a big round tub- not jacuzzi, but the same shape. I think it's like a roman tub? And there are 2 sinks in the bathroom, so you're not fighting for the sink or mirror while getting ready. The bedroom and living room are also large. There is a sleeper sofa in the living room and a tv/dvdplayer/cd player. The kitchenette has a full-sized fridge/freezer, a microwave, dishwasher, sink & dishes. Some of the rooms have toasters/blenders/electric griddles, but if your room doesn't, you can call down to the front desk and they will send one right up. I believe that the 2 bedroom units also come with a range. There is a balcony that can be accessed from doors in the bedroom or the living room. If you are getting an \"ocean view\" room, I recommend requesting a room on the pool side. The view is a little nicer. Both sides have an ocean view, but if you are on the non-pool side, you can see the dumpsters and stuff... On one of my trips, we had a \"deluxe ocean view\" room. Luckily, I had been there before and stayed in an ocean view because our \"deluxe\" was in exactly the same spot as our regular ocean view room. We booked the deluxe thinking it would be one of the rooms in the very front with an unrestricted full ocean view right over the sand. We went to the front desk to complain, and the manager was very nice and gave us a $100 or $150 (I can't remember) credit toward our bill so we could use it toward the bar/restaurant or parking or whatever. Apparently there are some rooms that are kind of gray areas and can be booked as either ocean view or deluxe ocean view. So he gave us a map of the hotel and showed us which rooms we would want to request a couple of weeks before our stay. So I suggest calling and requesting a room in the front if you are getting a deluxe ocean view 2-3 weeks prior to your arrival date. Nearby: A short walk and across the street, there is a small shopping center with Pizza Paradiso which is delicious. There is also a little Mexican restaurant/bar and a Star supermarket as well as some other things. I suggest going to Costco instead. It is on the way to the hotel from the airport and you can buy your liquor/beer/snacks there. They have a different selection than the mainland Costcos I've been to. They have Malibu rum and Mai Tai mix and stuff. They also have a lot of macadamia nut stuff, so you can get all of your coworkers chocolate covered macadamia nuts there =) There is a bus stop next to the hotel that will take you to Whaler's Village which is a shopping center adjacent to the main Ka'anapali beach that has Coach, Louis Vuitton, Honolua, etc and they have the Hula Grill which has a barefoot bar and Leilani's restaurant. The bus will also take you to Lahaina. The Hard Rock in Lahaina has an awesome view as well as some of the other restaurants, but my favorite was a restaurant called Lahaina Store Grille & Oyster bar. They have rooftop dining and you can go around sun down and get a couple of drinks while watching the spectacular sunset. There isn't really anywhere right next to the hotel to go out at night except for the one bar, but we were there for Halloween last year and took the bus to Lahaina and a cab back and the cab was like $20 for 4 people from Lahaina to the hotel- not bad. Maui: I would not go to Maui without a rental car. The hotel is about a 35 minute drive from the airport and if you don't have a car, you can't drive up to Hana and other things that are fun to do. Hana is definitely a must and you can buy a CD guide at pretty much any grocery or liquor store or ABC store. I have been to Hana with and without the CD and the CD is pretty helpful. It tells you about certain places to stop that you wouldn't otherwise know about. If you are wanting to snorkel, I say go off the shore and snorkel around Black Rock at the main beach in Ka'anapali. You don't need to pay to go out to Molokini. There is better stuff around that rock. There are tons of fish and even sea turtles if you go a little further out. The Maui Ocean Center is also full of interesting stuff including a sea turtle tank and a hammerhead shark tank. There are some cool things in Wailea including the Tommy Bahama bar which has some really funny drinks. I got a s'more martini that actually had a toasted marshmallow in it lol. Beware of 5:00 traffic when driving around the island because it SUCKS. You can't pass and you can get stuck on that little 2 lane highway for awhile. The Ka'anapali Beach Hotel is all around a great place to stay in a great location. It's not 5 star, but I would say 4 star. If you are looking for 5 star, you will be disappointed.

The furnishings were the same that i remember. Not by any means old or worn out. Tommy Bahama style. Apparently, some of the rooms have been upgraded with flat screen tvs, but we didn't get one. But it didn't matter. Our tv was just fine. Anyways, we didn't come to Maui to sit in our room. Our bed was very comfy, the pillow was almost too fluffy for me. Our friends said the pull out couch was fine--afterall it was free for them!! We attended the welcome presentation the next morning in the downstairs lobby and we were upset to see there wasn't any hot food this time, like the last one. Only muffins and danishs--and they weren't very good. This gave us a great chance to book some activities and set up our required presentation. We also learned about a workout program that was available everyday of the week for just $50 and it included yoga, pilates, and a pool class. I only got to take advantage of 2 days, 1 class the first day on the front lawn doing yoga and then 3 classes a couple days later--this one included the water workout class which was my favorite. Wanted to take advantage of it more, but hey, vacation plans got in the way. Still worth it for only $50. Got to sit by the pool a couple of days. Enjoyed that a lot. Never had a problem getting 2 or 4 chairs in a row the whole stay. The pool is a little old, but i understand they are going to be re-doing it April-June. Not really neccessary, but i'm sure it will look fantastic when done. Towels were never a problem, just bring your towel ticket with you and trade it out. The hot tub was wonderful. The waterfalls are pretty to look at and the waterslide looked like a lot of fun for the kids. Never got to sit on the beach, but we took portraits on the sand and it was very soft and nice. Not very wide, but enough room for whatever. From our room view this time around, we noticed 4 grills down by the beach that we didn't even know where there--or even if they were in the past. We took advantage of them one night and it worked out great. Loaded up the food onto plates, brought silverware and drinks and headed down. The men grilled and the women sat at the picnic tables and enjoyed their wine. As far as other food, couldn't tell you. As mentioned, there used to be a breakfast buffet, but no more. Didn't feel like paying, so we just went to the store and bought breakfast foods for the AM and saved money. Dinners were all eaten out except for the one grilled. As far as an explanation about the no more breakfast buffet, apparently many owners that didn't take advantage of it complained and instead of raising owner's fees to include the cost of breakfast, they just did away with it. That's fine--i can eat in my room. The one thing that did disappoint us was the complimentary happy hour that existed back when the place was an Embassy Suites. It was always a nice event to kick start your evening and to save a lot of bucks in the alcohol department. But again, the explanation we learned in the timeshare presentation was because a few people got a little tipsy, feel down, the Maui Board of alcohol got involved and they put a stop to it. The hotel tried $1 and $2 drinks, but apparently, that broke the rule as well. So, now they do a 50% off happy hour down at the pool, and that was really fine with us. Good drinks for about $4 instead of $8. We were very glad to see that our favorite bartender, Dave, was still there since there is no more happy hour. He is the best! Loves his job. Anyways, we would either have a couple drinks in our room before going out to dinner, or we would stop by and sit with Dave for a little while and enjoy a cocktail. They even had karaoke 2x that week--Wednesday i think and Saturday--that was a lot of fun. The guy that runs it is a very good singer and a nice guy. Participation was good...not overly crowded that you couldn't sing a couple of times. I have read complaints about the elevators, but we didn't experience anything unusual in a building that has 12 floors. Never waited more than a minute for one. They did maintenance one day which closed our elevators, so we just used the next ones over. No big deal. The concierge desk was helpful booking activities. As owners who were doing a presentation, we were given $250 Mahalo Dollars that we could apply towards activities, but had to be used in full. Our friends got this money as well. Lastly, we did our timeshare presentation and they tried to get us to upgrade with \"new program\" they now have. But honestly, one week in Maui is all we can afford, as nice as it would be to stay for longer. We didn't take it and they did not pressure us, nor my friends. But we were there for 90 minutes or longer and we did have to go take a tour of the same type room that we were staying in which was a bit ridiculous. But whatever...worth the $250 per couple. We got to go ATV riding and whale watching with that money. Check-out was fast and easy. Since we weren't leaving until 11:40pm, we stored our luggage at the hotel, did our things during the day and went back to pick up our stuff before heading to the airport. We just packed the clothes for the plane separate so it was easier. Overall, our stay was wonderful, perfect, terrific...heck it's Maui! Can it be bad? KBC was just as nice as i remember, that is why we bought in the first place. I do a lot of travelling and don't expect the best all the time. But this really was. Anyone who says it is old or run down or ugly needs to go stay at the Four Seasons or Ritz and pay a fortune! Leave this place to those who really love it! Until next time KBC, i am only expecting the same or better!

We had never been to Maui before, our only comparisons being all inclusive resorts throughout Mexico. I booked the first week through a timeshare exchange, and the additional 3 days through Expedia, which caused some confusion with front desk, but all turned out alright. My criteria in booking this resort was fairly simple - wanted to be on Kaanapali Beach, nice room and a big pool! We really enjoyed this resort. Check in went fine, we found all the front desk people to be very nice and helpful. Were quite happy with our room, had a nice ocean view, the huge bathroom that others have commented on, etc. Didn't find the furnishings to be old at all, but I think my son at times found the sofa bed to be a little uncomfortable. We asked for additional pillows and blankets that came quickly. The cleaning service came once during the timeshare week, then daily during the expedia days. We never had a problem with towels, were always plentiful, the garbage you could just leave outside your door and they would pick it up, the cleaning ladies would come first thing in the morning, so we definitely didn't have any complaints. We also used the valet parking, which again was no problem, they were always very friendly, helpful and always appreciative of any tips. The pool was great, and a definite highlight for my kids. They played water volleyball daily (which may not have pleased other guests sometimes??), the temperature of the water was nice and warm, it actually had a deep end (rare in Mexico). The hot tub was also nice, but was usually quite full and the waterfalls were gorgeous. Lounge chairs were plentiful and very comfortable. And the towel card system was great - turn in your wet, sandy towels and get new clean ones!! This is quite common in Mexico, so we didn't have a problem with it at all. We also found the 'movie night' a nice surprise - twice a week they set up a screen outside and play a fairly current movie. The beach was also very nice, but I missed having loungers on the beach. You could use the loungers at the end of the grass on the resort, so I did do that a couple of times. The beach was rocky, but was fine with water shoes. The restaurant/bar were ok. I had drinks during happy hour (3-5) a couple of times, but was strange - my drinks were $4.00, my kids virgin drinks were almost $7.00?? I found that odd, and expensive, so we didn't have many. We ate breakfast there 4 days (included with the Expedia booking) and was very good but the waiters never knew about it, so we had to explain it every morning. We did eat supper there once, I didn't find the prices any worse than in Lahaina, and the food was decent. Great views, and a good kikei menu! My only problem with the resort, and it's very minor, was the gift shop. The lady working there really didn't know what she was doing, made the fellow in front of me (and consequently me) wait 15 minutes while she tried to look up his room number, then couldn't scan the book I wanted to purchase, so just told me I couldn't buy it?! Again, a bit odd. So we're now going through Maui withdrawl.

We knew we wanted a hotel/condo/timeshare with a kitchen so we could save a little money and eat breakfast in the room. We found this listing on Craigslist.com through a couple who was selling their timeshare for the week of our honeymoon. We were a little skeptical at first, but had heard good things abou the Kaanapali Beach Club, so we went for it. When we walked into our suite at the Kaanapali Beach Club, we were amazed. It completely surpassed our expectations! First impression was the size of the suite. It's huge. It has a big bedroom with a king size bed--so comfortable! Then a giant bathroom, almost the size of the bedroom. The bathroom has a separate tub and a standing glass shower next to it, 2 sinks, separate toilet closet and a big double sided closet. The living room/dining room/kitchen area is equally big and spacious. We had no complaints about the decor or furniture being old at all. Everything looked clean, newly updated and luxurious. The towels are copious and the bed was so comfortable, it made it hard to get out of bed in the morining. The kitchen includes a microwave, toaster, frig, coffee maker, utensils, plates/bowls, etc. We also called conceirge and borrowed grilling tools. We ended up grilling on the resort grills and ate at the picnic tables outside one night. The staff was always very friendly from the second we pulled up to the front lobby. Check in was easy. We NEVER felt pressured to attend any timeshare meetings. (Another place we stayed in the Carribean, had people following you around while you were walking to ask you about buying timeshares--this never happened at Kaanapali Beach Club). Everyone was friendly and accommodating--valet, front desk, cleaning people, pool attendants, etc. We didn't have any problems at all. The Ohana restaurant on the resort was good. We had a few meals there, as well as drinks. It is located right next to the pool area, so very convenient for happy hour :) Food was good--not comparable to the pricey island dinners you can get, but it was still tastey and affordable. The pool area is fine--I don't agree with the other reviews that it's old. The pool was always clean and the landscaping is beautiful. Lots of man-made waterfalls and a waterfall pool--make for a relaxing pool day. Plenty of chairs poolside, we never had a problem getting one, and the towel service poolside was great--very convenient. The Kaanapali Beach is right there--beautiful beach, BIG waves, be careful.

The young lady that checked us in was completely gracious. Later on our vacation we ran into her at the mall, and she called out to us and was so lovely, even though we didn't recognize her. The suite was large and handsomely furnished. The kitchenette was extremely clean and modern with a terrific round table to dine at, a dishwasher and microwave. The beds and linens were ridiculously comfortable and soft with beautiful coverlets. And the bathroom was simply outstanding with a large soaking tub and separate glass shower. The toilet is tucked away in it's own closet, and there are two separate sinks and mirrors. Though there were only two of us, the suites would be ideal for a family.

I had been reading reviews and rants for months prior to our trip and was nervous to be honest. However, I must say that out of 10 Stars (for example), I would give the \"ENTIRE\" property an 8.5 The staff was super friendly. The front desk was outstanding and always helpful. Our check-in assistant, Christina, could not have been more exciting and helpful. Valet was there if wanted, but we self-parked 95% of the time. It was easier for us! We thankfully had our parking fee of $13 a day taken care of for us (probably because we were ENCORE guests of the resort). The Pool was excellent and we never had a bad time there! The waterfalls were fun and the pool always a great temperature! We do wish they would extend the pool hours. Closing at 10pm is not exactly a nice thing for adults who want to unwind after a long day out sightseeing - even the hot tubs stopped! We took our own beach towels to avoid any issues with the \"Pink Cards\" - we did not want to pay the fee should we have lost the cards! The beach here at the club is fantastic and there are some snorkeling opportunities just north of the property borderline! Sure, the elevators are a bit slow and one tower is out of service unitl about 9/16, but it only took about 5 minutes or less to use the elevators. Be patient - you are on vacation! We never ate at the restaurants on site; so we can't comment on them! We had a Deluxe Ocean View room - that faced to the north so we could see the island of Molokai and the north shore of West Maui (plus the west Maui mountains to the north) - so other than a direct on beach view, we had an excellent view!! The room was spacious for 3 adults and we used pretty much every inch of it and the bathroom was just big enough for 3 adults.

Please keep in mind there are folks who are very picky and will complain and write negative reviews about every little thing. Yes, we can be particular, but we also realize we're not staying at the Four Seasons (which, by the way, is a great property in Wailea). We've stayed in various places in Maui (usually 4 stars or better), but wanted a suite, without having to stay in a condo (we're a family of 5) and not have to pay a month's worth of salary. So, after much research, we narrowed it down to two places - The Fairmont in Wailea or Kanaapali Beach Club. Obviously we choose KBC, primarily due to the cost (quarter of the price of the Fairmont) and wanting to stay on the west side of Maui. We were not disappointed. At first, we were a bit hesitant based on the reviews and thoughts of staying in an 80's style pink building, but all those negative thoughts went away as soon as we pulled up to the valet. Here's a few tidbits: - the opened-aired lobby was nice - the pool was in decent condition, but GREAT if you have kids (they have a smaller pool - 3 1/2 feet - with a slide) - the room was beyond our expectations (two room suite, microwave, full size refrigerator, sink, dishwasher, two 42\" plasma TVs, huge bathroom with separate tub and shower and enclosed toilet and two sinks) - ask for the \"most recently renovated room\" on the \"pool side\" with a \"deluxe ocean view\" - the kid's menu (called the Kieki menu) was terrific. All items all were $2 (great burgers). You can get this during sit-down at the Ohana Grill or at the take out window. - we rented a cabana for a few days ($75, but it's literally on the beach and yours for the entire day (our kids took a nap and ate lunch in the cabana). It was also a great place for them to get a break from the sun. - Get the $15 all-you-can-drink coconut when you arrive. They basically provide all the drinks you want during your stay. - they have happy hour from 5:30 - 6:30 with 1/2 priced cocktails - Charles, the kid's activity director, is SUPER nice person. All the kids loved him. They just started the program, so they're still working on the room and games. - Koi fish feeding each afternoon - the kids loved it. - There's a large market across the street and the prices were actually better than the Safeway in Lahaina. - Great beach (short walk from the pool to the water). So, how do you get the best deal? We had a 7 night stay in an ocean view romm, full breakfast included each day for the entire family (usually costs $12.50 pp), free parking (cost is $13 per day), and 10% off all activities if booked through the activities desk (the prices were very competitive). For all this, we paid about $1300. The catch is sitting through the time-share presentation, which can be as long (2 hrs) or short (30 mins) as you like, depending on the number of questions you ask. If you're upfront and let them know you have no intent of buying, the sales pitch is scaled way back. Don't feel guilted into showing them you're interested. They're used to folks taking advantage of the promotional rate. We actually sat through the entire presentation and they re-offered the promotional package to us again, which we took advantage of for our next trip to Maui. All in all, it took us a day or so to get the vibe of the place, but by far it's the easiest, most economical and family friendly place we've stayed in Maui. The only negatives I could think of was the limited food menu for adults, narrow lanais (unless you're in a corner room) and there tends to be a bit more wind in north Kanaapali (another great reason to get the cabana). If you're not seeking \"Four Seasons\" type of accomodations and need the extra space, this is THE PERFECT place to stay, especially for the price. As I mentioned earlier, don't believe all the negative comments, this review is a real as it gets. We tend to be hotel snobs and were somewhat hesitant about this place, but we plan to return annually. Anyway, hope this helps everyone who was contemplating staying at KBC.

Check in was quick and friendly and our room had a beautiful ocean view, as requested. Everywhere you turn there are waterfalls, tropical flowers and wide open spaces. The grounds were meticulously maintained, yet I never saw any gardeners out and about-kind of reminded me of Disney. The tropical pool was very large and never overcrowded. It had a volleyball net so there was always a game going on and a slide that our kids enjoyed. They had complementary cups and coolers full of ice cold water poolside. Best of all, from most lounge chairs you also had a view of the ocean. And speaking of lounge chairs, they all had new cushions that were very comfortable-no slat marks here! The beach was wide, swimable and also uncrowded, with terrific views of Molokai. The work out room is adjacent to the pool and has everything one would want to stay in shape while indulging in lava flows! All with a view your local gym would love to have. Our room was spacious, clean, and well decorated. The kitchens have full size refrigerators, microwaves, and dishwashers, but no stove. I requested an electric frying pan and they brought it right away. Eating out all the time can cramp your activity time (and your wallet), so I didn't mind a little time in the kitchen. A grocery store is within walking distance of the property. The resort also provides awesome oceanfront gas grills and picnic tables-bbq in paradise! Since I'm on the subject, another pleasant surprise was the large $2 kids menu that the resort offered, either eat-in or take out at the grill. They also sold coconut head cup holders with unlimited soda refills for $15.00. The kids seemed happy enough on their sofa bed, and the king size in the bedroom was terrific. The linens were especially nice-I should have looked to see what kind of pillows they had, because I would like to buy them for my own bed at home. The patio furniture was getting a little worn, but otherwise everything was in good condition. We were never bothered about (or wanted to)attend the timeshare orientation, but we did attend the breakfast buffet activity orientation our first morning there. They went over the various activities available and you could book them if you wanted, but it was low pressure and convenient. This was our fifth trip to Maui, and we've done all of the activities before, so we spent more time at the resort than we usually do. If you can only fit in a few activities, I'd say definitely see Haleakala, drive to Hana if you don't get carsick, shop Lahaina on art night (Friday eve.) and take a snorkel trip to Molokini. The only drawback to Molokini is the variety of fish will forever make you disappointed in subsequent snorkeling elsewhere. We've been snorkeling arout the Carribean and always end up saying \"well that wasn't even close to Molokini'. Our favorite place for an incredible breakfast is the Gazebo in Napili. If you arrive after 8:00, there may be a long wait, but the stunning views and macadamia nut pancakes with coconut syrup make it all worthwhile. Afterwards, spend some time at Napili Bay. If you golf, you should play Kapalua at least once in your lifetime, though we were saddened to see they had doubled their rates in the few years since we had played it. The fees were in the $250 + range. If that's not doable, at least take a drive around Kapalua and maybe get lunch at the clubhouse-the views are spectacular. There are also new hiking paths on the ridge above Kapalua. You take a complementary shuttle from the Kapalua discovery center. We went on an overcast day, and it was a nice hike through some interesting trees and plants. Back at KBR, a torchlighter started every evening with his ceremony, and live music started around 5:00 at the beachside lounge.

We enjoyed all of the acitivities that we picked with the help of Kyra (our conceirge at the breakfast). The beach at the hotel is great and the pool is large and was never overcrowded. The food at the resort is good but venture into Lahaina for some great food and spectacular views. The resort offers scuba lessons at the pool and take you out to do an open water dive afterwards, my husband loved this. I enjoyed the Pride of Maui am snorkeling cruise and would highly recommend them, great service, no attitudes great with my 6 year old son!!!!! For surfing lessons we used Outrageous surf, they were fantastic!!!! my favorite activity!!!!!! The road to Hana is pretty, but be prepared to spend all day in the car and to hike (on unsteady rocky, muddy, and VERY slippery) trails to see most of the waterfalls.

My overall impression was that the ownership was scrimping on maintenance, doing just enough to keep the first impression good while selling timeshares. The location is great (although not on the main part of Ka'anapali) but it is right on the ocean. The pool is huge (although it needs replastering to get rid of the brown stains on the bottom), the slide is fun (when it is attended - otherwise it's closed for a 1 1/2 hr lunch break every day) and there are plenty of lounge chairs. If you want shade, you have to pay $100 for a tent - something that is kept secret until your stuff gets moved and when you ask the person in your chair, you are informed of this policy - very embarrassing! Our room looked nice, but smelled musty. One bed had a trough in the middle, it was so bad, I had to switch beds with my kids. The rollout couch went downhill, but it's a rollout, so what do you expect. Maid service was at 3 pm every day by which time we were back in the room taking naps and showers, so we'd usually just get towels and skip the cleaning. The maid knocked on the door as we were checking out wanting a tip. Mini golf course is fun, although the carpet is peeling, the flags are falling apart and it looks like it needs TLC. The nice sit down restaurant, North Shore Grill which was advertised ad-nauseum in posters all over the place does not exist any more. The time share guy said it was being renovated, but I saw no evidence of this. 2 of the 6 elevators were not working, so there was usually a wait for an elevator. If you are there for the time share presentation, be prepared. They say it's 90 minutes to 2 hrs. We were there for 2 1/2 hrs and I was having my kids call my cell screaming so I'd have an excuse to leave. If you're thinking about buying, say no to their first offer, they dropped the price by 1/2 after we said no. When we said no the second time, he did the used car salesman trick of going to talk to the manager who thankfully was busy (after 15 minutes of sitting there) and didn't come out. Then we were asked to fill out a \"survey\" which was another sales pitch to come back next year and do it all again! No thanks. BTW there are numerous timeshare resellers all over the place who have timeshares at prices way less than what is being offered - check prices before going, you can probably bargain for a better deal if you really want to get into this. Every time I asked about a maintenance issue, I was told that it was going to be redone - but I didn't see any work occurring while I was there. The scuba was fun, and the food was reasonably priced. I wouldn't go again just because it's not worth the savings to get hassled by the time share people.

So, after much procrastination , I have reviewed by scribbled notes and pondered my memories, and now present for your information and ridicule, my review of my stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Vacation Resort (KBVR) (almost always referred to as the \"Embassy\"). This review is another \"thank you\" to all my Trip Advisor Forum friends and local experts who continue to provide so much invaluable advice and information. You made my Maui adventure the fantastic tour that it was. Mahalo! The review of my 8 day stay at the Ka'anapali Beach Vacation Resort on Maui, from 11-3 to 11-10-06: 1. is it a \"large, 8-acre, oceanfront resort\" as it says in the on-line ad? yes it is! I didn't actually measure the acres, true, but the size of the place as you pull up from the main drag is impressive and it is indeed on the ocean. No streets to cross. No dangerous steep hills to descend. It is truly on the beach and oceanfront! And when I vacationed there it was painted pink! 2. how was the \"full American breakfast buffet and sunrise at poolside\", as is also described in the on-line ad? It was ok but had I had to pay for it, I might have felt differently. We got our daily buffet comped as an incentive for us to buy. Oh, and it wasn't at poolside. It was presented in the North Beach Grille, in the oceanfront section of the restaurant and we sat almost at water's edge. The wonderful floor to ceiling windows allowed for ocean breezes to sweep in and it had great natural light reflecting in off the ocean in the early morning. A perfect setting for early morning coffee and newspaper reading. You could eat as early as 7AM, which was perfect for us, since we were stuck on East Coast USA time for the entire week! Other than the omelet station, however, I thought that the quality of the fruits and pastries at the breakfast buffet was just so so. But the coffee was Kona, I guess, and it was delicious. Oh, and I got a tip for you: wear a hat to breakfast! The huge windows of the restaurant are opened for breakfast and this is a great thing but the island birds have become accustomed to this and to the fact that parents allow their spoiled bratty children to feed them by hurling bread crumbs from the table out onto the garden paths and the birds have now gotten so used to this that they fly right into the restaurant in anticipation! So be prepared for all manner of birds to swoop in from the beach as you eat your beakfast. You get used to it....you are on Maui, after all! 3. how was the \"complimentary manager's cocktail reception at sunset\" as is described in the on-line ad? I don't know! Never made it to one of these receptions. Never hung around the resort or got back from our various sorties around the island soon enough. I'm not a big \"reception\" kind of person, anyway, and I don't drink tropical fruit cocktails. I probably would not have fit in had I showed up with a pitcher of margaritas. Maybe next time? ( Although several comments that have been posted recently seem to indicate that new management has put an end to these sunset rituals.) 4. was the description of the place as \"located on Maui's magnificent north Ka'anapali Beach, overlooking the crystal blue Pacific and the lush green mountains of West Maui.....perfect for that romantic 2nd honeymoon or for a family vacation\" accurate? Yes! A big thumbs up for the accuracy of this description, IMO! The Pacific was indeed blue or so it appeared from my lanai at sunrise. And the mountains were lush and green. Wonderful to look up at. In addition, and not mentioned in the ad, were the islands off shore. From my lanai, the island of Molokai (I think) was in full view and was another beautiful addition to the total scene. Each sunrise was a visual and spiritual treat. Oh, and BTW, the KBVR is not located on THE Ka'anapali Beach. It is on North Ka'anapali Beach. More about this a little later.. 5. were the condos of the KBVR spacious (as described in the on-line ad) ? Yes! This was no exaggeration! I would, indeed, say that the condo that we enjoyed, which was a 1BR standard unit, with standard ocean view looking west, was spacious! For 2 adults! And that was what we were. And it was the perfect size for us. The lanai was a bit \"thin\", meaning that you could not extend a lounger out front to back width-wise, you had to turn it length-wise, but it was big enough to enjoy that early AM coffee as the sun did it's thing with the ocean. I enjoyed this orientation. A lanai that got direct morning sun would much less enjoyable, IMO. Trades or no trades, the sun heats things up fast on the Maui West Coast. 6. how did the amenities compare with the descriptions in the on-line ads? IMO, right on target! The best is the bath. The description says that it is a \"luxurious, oversized bath area\" and I agree. Mind, it is THE only bath, so if you are going to share this space with 3 other adults me thinks that you would be tight, but for 2 adults, it is indeed oversized and luxurious. The wife and I could do all bathroom routines without crowding each other because there is so much floor space. His and her sinks and vanities. Separate jacuzzi bathtub and shower ( a walk-in shower- big enough to drop the soap and to bend over and pick it up). There was decent water pressure and I liked the luxury shower head. Good exhaust too. No problem fogging up the place with steam. The sinks and vanities and floor were nicely appointed. Classy marble sink tops and quality floor tiles. The on-line photos of the bath space found in the 1BR units that can be found on-line are accurate. The private access to the bath from the master bedroom (the only bedroom) is a nice touch to the design adding a bit of privacy in case you might decide to turn the living room into a bedroom for a visitor or 2. Or, God forbid, children! Because, yes, again true to the on-line description, there is a full sized sofa bed in the LR space and it was kinda comfortable as a couch. We never had reason to sleep on it opened up as a bed so I can't comment on its comfort level in that way. I thought that the king size bed was comfortable (I can sleep almost anywhere I can lie down with a pillow and fresh air) and I liked it that the lanai could be accessed from the bedroom as well as the LR. The BR had good closet space. Luggage could be stowed away easily inside it and off the floor. Plentiful drawer space too. Also a desk space, with desk, chair, and lamp, which was a nice surprise. Do not recall if there was an internet connection at the desk. There was an additional color TV (20 inch) in the bedroom which was a nice plus. The bedding was comfortable to me without knowing what the thread counts were! Regarding the \"mini-kitchen equipped with microwave and dishwasher\" ..., this was as described but also included a full size frig with freezer. And we took full advantage of it, too. We asked for a plug-in skillet which greatly expanded the kitchen space's functionality, especially for breakfasts and for reheating leftovers. There was also a coffeemaker. Tip- pack filters and coffee. We did take out almost every day while in West Maui from the wonderful Honokowai Okazuya & Deli or from the Star Market that was nearby, saving a small fortune in culinary costs. Dining out on Maui, anywhere, can get very pricey! There was a dining area with table and chairs serviced from the kitchen space that was more than adequate for the 2 of us but might have been tight for 4. Overall, the furniture looked to be in good shape. Not plush, not elegant, not brand new.....but certainly serviceable. Diito for cabinets and counter tops. 7. How about the \"modern entertainment center\" that the on-line ads talk about? Our unit had nothing special. The TV was standard and adequate size (35 inch) but not flat screen and not HDTV and if there were pay-per view movies I never noticed. Cannot recall if there was a DVD Player either! Anybody who thinks that they will spend time in their room looking at movies or TV, especially during their 1st ever visit to Maui, is nuts! But then there is that \"perfect for a family vacation\" theme mentioned in the on-line ads, wasn't there? So I guess having an Entertainment Center to keep the children busy is an important consideration for parents who foolishly bring their children along to enjoy Maui with them. LOL! Tip: bring some DVDs with you if you must bring children along! 8. \"The grounds are alive with lush tropical gardens and interlocking waterways and waterfalls. By far the most spectacular and prominent water feature is the 1 acre pool and a 60 foot water slide with its own splash pool. This creates the perfect environment for a family vacation\". This is the description that I read on-line and that, I must admit, appealed to my lust to vacation in Hawaii, at least once. So, how did the real thing compare to this advertisement boast? IMO, It was right on the mark! The place was a wonder. Wonderful openness everywhere so you get the trade winds and the waterways and the waterfalls and the ocean beyond to one side and the hillsides and mountains above, and, well, it sure worked its magic on me. A definite \"10\", IMO. Great to wake up to, great to come back to, great to just walk around in. And did I mention that the buildings are all painted pink? 9. Other thoughts: The lobby elevators were all glass so you could view the pool/ocean and/or mountains going up and coming down. This got you in a Maui frame of mind right away as long as your wait was minimal. They were not air conditioned and could get uncomfortable if you had to wait awhile inside one while somebody loaded or unloaded their bags or collected their children. But they worked well while we were there, an advantage of enjoying the slow season, and they had obviously survived the flooding of the lobby. However, I understood while chatting with owners who return year after year that this is not always the case. The elevators have been a problem and the resort is planning to update them. That means another increase in the ownership maintenance fees for sure! LOL! Elevators at resorts take a heavy beating as is. Throw in the long term effects of salt water and sand and children.......and.......$$$$$$$'s are needed to keep them going. Wide open spaces. I loved it that the hallways and walkways and balconies and lobby were all open for free flow of those tropical trade wind breezes, but this had its down side when the island got whacked by a series of incredible rains the days before we arrived. The road to the south shore resorts from the airport had had to be closed and there was talk of shutting the access road to the west shore too. When we pulled up in front of the \"Embassy\" we were amazed at the sight. The lobby was under water! The rain had filled up the various ponds and waterways that surround the lobby and the staff had had to actually sandbag the run off to keep one lane of walkway to the check-inn safely above water. We were very lucky. It never rained again during our entire week, at least not during the day. I loved the openness. Rain is a risk worth taking. Air conditioning. Air conditioning and ceiling fans are a must in Maui, IMO. We were there in late October and it was hot and humid even then. It has to be worse in the summer. Our unit had both a.c and ceiling fans (2) and were we ever grateful. After a day in the sun we could not wait to return to the comfort of our air conditioned condo. And the ceiling fans in the LR and in the BR kept that conditioned air flowing perfectly thru the space. I need that to sleep. There was no electric meter churning out an additional charge for the a.c. but maybe there should be. We are green minded and kept our a.c turned way down while we were away. I hoped that others did too. Parking. Something that I was very happy we were \"gifted\" with was valet parking. The wife and I were totally drained after being in the sun all day. And we enjoyed the luxury of pulling up at the valet station and having somebody else park the car. The fact that valet parking is provided gives the KBVR that \"resort\" touch of class and it surely spoils you. Would I have opted to pay an additional $25.00/ day + tip for each coming and going? Ask me in year 2010 when we plan to return! The parking rate at the time of our vacation was $12.00/ day. Remember , that was almost 2 years ago! Laundry. The condo that we occupied did not have a laundry. There was a laundry with coin operated washers and dryers on our floor, and we used them almost every day. I believe that you could also take advantage of a Laundry Service pick up and drop off to your room if you wanted. Dry cleaning too. Most owners that I spoke with told me that not having washers and dryers on each floor was a major point of contention at the moment with ownership. Housekeeping. You get the standard mid-week housekeeping. You could arrange for more....at a price, of course. The bath towels were standard quality. Not plush. But there was an ample supply. Toiletries were provided and replenished. I had no complaints. The place looked clean when we checked-in and we kept it that way. There was no hint of smell of cigarette or cigar which I considered a big, big plus. View. The on-line ads that I studied before deciding on the KBR deceive a bit about the view that can be enjoyed, IMO. Do not be deceived. Unless you get a 2BR unit you are not getting that spectacular oceanfront view that you might have seen in the ads. Those units are very scarce and very expensive. Maybe some day for us, but for now we were satisfied with our view, which as mentioned previously was standard ocean view but on the north side so our lanai got morning shade. We could see ocean and we could see mountain from our setting. Not much of either but enough. The views that the so-called \"deluxe ocean views\" had were not that much better, IMO. Certainly not worth another $1,000.00 or more! I think that I would splurge another $200.00 to go standard ocean view over scenic view, however, because I love the smells and sounds of sea and salt air! However, I do not think that you can request a specific room or view, unless you are an owner, and even then it is the luck of the draw that decides which owner will get the best of the best views in a select room view category, which I think runs: scenic (aka garden), ocean view, luxury ocean, and ocean front. Some ads will also show a nice photo of the resort's pool with a building that looks to be almost alongside the pool and right on the beach. Again, don't be deceived. This is not the KBVR. This is another condo building altogether and not at all related to the KBVR. Other stuff. The KBVR had a busy concierge and activities desk where we obtained lots of useful and up to date information, including a few money saving coupons. The 18 hole miniature golf course was located on the roof of a building and looked to have weathered those rain storms that I mentioned earlier pretty badly. Our lanai was located directly overlooking this rooftop. I never saw anybody playing golf on it. There was a fitness center somewhere I was told but I successfully avoided it all week. I did successfully find a great poolside bar and met each sunrise there with a bloody mary after a brisk ocean walk. Hint- bring your own tabasco and a fresh lemon. I enjoyed teaching my bartender friend the extrafine details of preparing THE Bloody Mary Cocktail. I also enjoyed watching the NFL games from poolside early Sunday morning while sipping my bloody mary and chomping on a celery stick. You need some vegetable in your diet, you know! BTW, the pool, as mentioned, was a thing of beauty, with waterfalls and waterslides and the Pacific Ocean as a background. At night, it gets all lite up by torch light. Very pretty! Another advantage of vacationing off season is that you never have to stake out pool stuff at dawn and then guard it all day. From reading the reviews of others about the KBVR, this happens at poolside regularly during prime season, as I am certain it does at most resorts. We had absolutely no problems sitting wherever we wanted and pool chairs and towels were easily obtained. I give the pool area and environment a strong 10 of 10 rating for certain. The resort also had its own beauty salon and spa someplace but we were much too busy snorkeling to schedule for stuff like that. The vast, open air lobby had a few shops and the resort offered a calendar of kids programs that could keep the little buggers occupied while the parents got busy elsewhere. There is a children's pool and and of course a games room. Scuba lessons are offered in the pool and next time I plan on taking a few. Maui has fantastic places for snorkeling and I guess for scuba too, if you know how. Hint- go to Black Rock at the Sheraton. It was sensational. The KBVR also offered room service for breakfast and for lunch. Not certain if you could get dinner or not. There was mention of high speed internet availability but I didn't care. I was on vacation in Maui. Ka'anapali Beach. The KBVR has very little actual beach. The on-line advertisements will rave about the wonderful Ka'anapali Beach Scene but in truth, the KBVR is not part of that scene. It is part of the North Ka'anapali Beach Scene. People do go in the water in front of the resort, yes, but when we were there (late October) it was unprotected and looked to be rocky and rough. Certainly not for snorkeling. The beach action is back at Ka'anapali Beach and to get there you either hitch, grab a bus or a trolley, or drive your rental. By car it takes 5 minutes tops. Parking can be a chore, especially if you are there in peak summer season. I suggest parking near the Sheraton or actually at the Sheraton. You can stroll the entire Ka'anapali Beach Walkway from there and also snorkel at Black Rock, which is usually chock full of colorful fish. When you need a break, you can order a drink and a lunch or both at the Sheraton. They offer great poolside table service. Just remember to re-apply that sunscreen often. Another day you can park at Whaler's Village and shop and do some people watching as you stroll the along the paved beach walk. Usually there will be a band or 2 playing in the Mall or at one of the many outdoor restaurants or bars along the strip. Restaurant Tips- You will read that Mama's Fishouse is \"number 1\" but there are many number 1's on Maui. You are paying for Mama's notoriety big time. Unless you have a \"must do\" lust to take a photo at popular Mama's, and have the desire to drive all the way back across the island in certain traffic, for at least 60 minutes, in 1 lane, bumper to bumper, then I suggest that you pass on Mama's and the dinner for 2 that will easily cost you $200.00 or more plus tip. We were disappointed...can you tell? If you must go, go for lunch, early on a clear day, and enjoy the view and then travel up to Paia and stroll around. Find the Paia Fishmarket and wander around until you find the take out section. It was way in the back when I was there. Sense your mouth watering and your stomach churning as you smell those wonderful smells wafting away at you from the many varieties of take out suggestions that are available to you that day. Now find an appropriate bottle of wine or 2, be sure to pick up a cheap corkscrew, and head for the beach and maybe a sunset. Enjoy. Other restaurant suggestions: We enjoyed a great dinner at the Makawao Steakhouse where I savored some wonderful sushi, a bowl of Maui onion soup and a great prime rib (end cut) in front of a lively fire started in a huge fireplace that took the chill out of a previously (when we got there) chilly room. It's worth visiting Makawao Town too, so go early and visit the artsy shops. At the Ka'anapali Beach we had a great lunch at Leilani's Beachside Grill (downstairs) and enjoyed people watching as the crowds strolled or roller bladed or skate boarded on by! Another restaurant tip is the many waterfront bars on Front Street in Lahaina, which offer reasonably priced lunches, and if you go anytime near sunset, you will enjoy some of the best sunset views on the island. We also enjoyed a fine dining experience at a restaurant in Lahaina called David Paul's. Expensive but very worth it, IMO. More about that later. And I mentioned it previously but let me praise it once again....the Honokowai Okazuya & Deli on Lower Honoapilani Road. Wonderful take out dishes. I especially enjoyed their spicy fish of the day concoction. Ditto the Star Market, right across the street from the KBVR, which also offered lots of take out choices that we took advantage of. The Maui Real Estate Rental Market- On any given day you can see 10 or more offers to rent 1BR condo units at the KBVR, just like the one that we enjoyed. The market for the summer of 2008 appears to be in the $699 to $799.00 range for a 1 week stay (7 nights). Higher in July, lower in August. You can buy a unit on the resale market for $4,000.00 that can be used EOY. Management at the KBVR has changed though, so buying a private resale might be a bit tricky now. Annual maintenance fees run $1,800.00 and up at the KBVR ! Ouch! And this is about 1/2 what it is at other prime resorts on Maui. With the air lines facing big trouble trying to hold prices down while fuel prices escalate, I'm thinking that the travel situation to the Hawaiian Islands just might be in a general state of chaos very soon, with prices jumping up and then down again as the major players try to fill their half empty planes at the last minute. This may affect rental demand on Maui as soon as this Fall. If I was a \"bidding\" man, I think I would study this market very carefully and submit a few low ball offers.... if I could take some vacation in the Fall. If you could get a 1BR condo at the KBVR for 1 week for...say $500.00...then you would be sitting pretty and could spend that savings on a couple dinners at Mama's! LOL! Activities. My favorite was the bike ride down the Haleakala volcano. I used Maui Mountain Riders and they offer a sunrise trip from the top to the ocean, with a stop for lunch. Takes all day but great views and super photo ops. A chase car (actually a truck) follows all the way ready to repair and/or replace any bikes or bikers that go down along the way. I had to get my bike replaced when the brakes locked up. There are only a few short sections of flat traveling that requires vigorous pedaling during the entire trip. Most of the time you spend gawking at the views and trying to keep a specific distance from the biker ahead of you while you coast and brake and turn. My wife decided not to chance the bike ride and they let her ride with the truck driver. She got a personal, narrated tour from him as we descended down the mountain. Another \"must do\" activity is an off shore snorkel trip to the Turtle Reef, which is a coral reef located off a south shore golf course. The reef supports a nice variety of fish and rays and eels but the big draw is the huge green sea turtles that hang around and that surface now and then for a gulp of air amid lots of hysterical shouts from snorkelers who get scared shirtless when these monsters come up right beside them. One was my wife! LOL! This activity included a trip out to Molokini, which was fun and a thing to do, once, but the snorkeling that day was not nearly as good as it had been on Turtle Reef. I also recommend at least 1 full day in Lahaina. Bring your coupons. We had the opportunity to enjoy Halloween in Lahaina and this celebration gets rowdy early. Lahaina is the old capital of Maui and the core of the novel, Hawaii by Mr. James A. Michener, which is a must read before you go, IMO. As mentioned, in Lahaina, we treated ourselves to a very pricey dinner at David Paul's Lahaina Grill, and we were wowed! And not just by the price. Everything was perfect and the portions were enough for a 2nd meal later in the week. If they offer a rack of lamb, and you like rack of lamb, then go for this treat. It was done Pacific Rim style and was delicious. Also offered as a special dessert of the day was a luscious chocolate eclair kind of thing. Yummy! An advantage of being from the US East Coast is that we got hungry early on Maui and this motivated us to get to restaurants early. I suggest that you do this if you want choice eats at David Paul's. They sold out of most of that days dinner menu items by 7PM and closed. We lucky patrons who were inside were then treated to at least a full hour of impromptu song and dance by various members of the bar staff and kitchen staff. We were all delighted. It was one of the greatest of the great days and nights that we enjoyed on Maui. Save your pennies though. The David Paul's Restaurant is easily as expensive as Mama's. We passed on all of the luaus while on Maui, since we were heading for Oahu and a stay on Waikiki and our hotel had its own luau, right on the beach. Some of the other many activities that we didn't do were: helicopter ride, road to Hana (road was closed), visit to the brewery, hike the Iao Valley, vist the South Shore Maui resorts, play golf, catch a fish, see a whale breech, learn to surf, and eat at about 90 of the several hundred restaurants that I had targeted before I left, based on the suggestions of many of our TA members. Conclusion. OK, What I have left out? The Ka'anapali Beach Vacation Resort is probably still referred to as The Embassy by most locals and it is still erroneously referred to as the Ka'anapali Beach Club (KBC) in Lahaina by some uninformed sources. But now you are informed and you now know that the true name, at least for the immediate present, is the Ka'anapali Beach Vacation Resort, and it is located neither in Ka'anapali Beach nor in Lahaina. And it has undergone yet another ownership change. Some say this was needed. Others are not too sure about it. New ownership usually means higher maintenance fees! There was renovation going on while were there but we were up and out of our room long before the banging began. I questioned a few owners about this and was told that many of the condos are being completely refurbed. New appliances, new TVs, new counter tops, new furniture, new bedding....the works. That's when I realized that we were in a newly refurbished unit!. The stories that I then heard about the \"old\" units were distressing. There would have been trouble had we chanced on 1 of these. But...no harm...no foul...so they say! We enjoyed the week that we spent there very much and would definitely go back again, no matter what it was called, if it was just the wife and I. I am assuming that all units have been refurbished by now. But, I would not book the 1BR condo if I was bringing along another adult couple. Instead, I might try to book a 2nd 1BR unit. Given the rental offerings that I see recently, this may be doable for the same price as a 2BR villa at another resort on or near Ka'anapali Beach. The 1BR 1bath unit, although spacious, is not enough for me to share with 3 other adults while on vacation. I think that the 1BR 1Bath condo unit at the KBVR is a good value for 2 adults..... maybe the only true resort value on Maui with 1st class amenities and a perfect location, close enough to most everything yet far enough away to offer some space from the big crowds. Compare with similar offerings at the Ritz Carlton, Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton, Westin or Sheraton and see if you don't agree with me. When I shopped them, the KBVR offered savings of as much as $100.00 per nite over Studio or 1BR Units at most of these big names and they had not nearly the space or functionality of the KBVR condo that we enjoyed, which was approx 750 sq ft. plus lanai. Please let me know if I can answer any questions that you might have about the KBVR (Embassy) or about planning and enjoying Maui in general. There was a major development underway in the North Ka'anapali Beach neighborhood while we were vacationing but it was far enough away to not be a bother....then. It could be a different story now. There is also a big pool maintenance scheduled for 2009 so you want to inquire about that for certain if you are considering planning something around then. If any of the restaurants that I mentioned or any of the other suggestions that I made are now inaccurate, remember that my recollections are from notes made almost 2 years ago! Hey, good advice is worth waiting for, you know! LOL! But seriously, I'll be happy to share my thoughts with you, just as so many did with me as I planned my first visit.

We went along with it, and they were sweet and more than happy to talk with us. When we said no, our timeshare guy was great, he knew we weren't going to be buying. When his \"boss\" heard this, he came over and did his used car dealership talk with us, and we continued to decline. He then got hostile with us, and pretty much degraded us for another 20 minutes. It was ridiculous and from that point on, I made up my mind to NEVER stay there again. From the first time we stayed there, there was music by the pool, waitresses and waiters walking around taking orders by the pool, eating outdoors for breakfast, etc. NOW, there is none of that. No music, no outdoor breakfast, no poolside service. And the staff is far from happy to be there.

The food was very good but not fantastic. The hotel is near a small shopping center which contains a couple of resturants. They had better food but they were also a bit more expensive. The hotel itself is right on the beach and right near Black Rock and the Sheraton. The beach was clean, the grass was cut short and all the grounds were well taken care of. They charge you a per diem for parking but getting in and out was easy and with the price of the room, the parking cost wasn't horrible. Sorry, I can't remember the price of the parking. The pool area was clean and neat and had an outdoor shower to clean off from the beach. There were plenty of lounge chairs with shady areas and sunny areas. The bar and the snack food area reminded me of being on a cruise. Well located (near the pool), it allowed some of the guys to catch up on the east coast sports. The \"snack\" bar had more than snacks and I ate too much. Basic pub fare but jeez, some of these places offer prepackaged cookies and chips as pub fare!! Lastly, some of the places on Maui are beginning to charge a \"resort fee\" ... I don't know what that is but this place doesn't charge a resort fee which I appreciated.

My husband and I are in our mid-to-late 30's and were not traveling with children. We had traded in our timeshare week for a week on this property. The property is lush and green. Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Anytime we had questions, they were attentive to our needs. Their happy hour at their casual restaurant is very nice. They have 1/2 price fruity drinks during happy hour. The food was expensive (as are most things in Maui), but pretty good, especially when we didn't feel like going off-property. The bartenders are pretty personable and friendly. I had breakfast in the mornings at the nicer/fine dining restaurant. The buffet is pretty basic and has omelets and such. The views of Lanai from the restaurant are amazing on a clear days. They also have a casual take-out cafe for fast-food type stuff. We didn't try this cafe during our stay. We had a pretty sizeable room for the two of us. It was a one BR, king-size with living room and pull-out sofa. It had a dining room and kitchenette, with a full refrigerator, microwave, sink, toaster, and most kitchen cutlery. My only complaint was about the timeliness of room service. One day, we had been out all day and by 3 pm room service had not serviced our room. They arrived just as we got in at 3. Call me crazy, but I think room service should be done by then. We were in room 906 in the Ohana Tower. The room had a balcony with a couple of chairs, a small drink table and a lounging chaise. I frequently sat on the balcony on the lounger reading early in the morning or right before sunset. We overlooked the adjacent property and the pool, but had a good side view of the ocean. The only thing that I was only slightly annoyed about, which KBC could do nothing about, was the early construction noise of the new property next door - - truck noise and such. If you're a sensitive sleeper, you may want to request a room on the other side of the resort. I used the spa for a pedicure. It's by no means high-end, but gets the job done. The ladies there were very nice. Parking is $13/day in the garage regardless of whether or not you self-park or use valet. From what I understand, this is pretty standard for properties in Maui. Parking was never a problem. The elevators were a bit slow, especially coming from the lower level to upper levels, but we weren't really in a rush for anything, so the wait was the wait. The pool area has a waterfall pool area, a hot tub, a large pool, a kids pool and a water slide. It's pretty substantive and we never had issue finding open chairs at any time during the day. For those of you who want to work out while on vacation, they have a small work out room with cardio equipment, free weights, and nautilus equipment. From my view from the balcony, the work out room seemed to be well-used, especially in the mornings. My husband hit it a couple of times, but I was no where near there during this vacation. The beach that the resort is on is really pretty and didn't have many people on it. I'm thinking that we were there during non-peak, but I was really surprised that it wasn't bumper to bumper people. We were able to hang out really anywhere on the beach. For eating off-resort, we hit Pizza Paradiso, in the shopping center across the street from KBC. I wish we had hit it earlier in our trip. It's pretty good stuff. Also, we were about 15 minutes from Old Lahaina town, where all the restaurants and shopping are. There's a convenience store (ABC store) to the left of the resort, within walking distance. It's good for getting your macadamia nuts, magnets, and cheesy Hawaiian souvenirs. You can also hit the Safeway in Lahaina on the way to KBC to grab groceries for the week if you want to eat in a couple of times. I think that's it. All in all, it was a great experience.

We were able to get into the room before the posted check-in hour. Our room was very nice and very clean. We had a \"mountain view\" reservation, but ended up in a room with a view that was 50% ocean and 50% coast line and mountains (see photo). The bathroom was huge with separate tub and shower, two sinks and room to do a fox trot in between. The King Bed was very comfortable and the pull-out was okay (but for the kids - it was fine). It was nice having the DVD player in the family room. There was plenty of closet space for luggage and clothes. Our package included breakfast - which was an awesome way to start each day. Coming from the east - we were early risers each day and really enjoyed the tables by the large windows looking out at the beach (see photo - nearly on the beach) and watching the daylight come out (and seeing the whales splash about). The main part of the buffet was good. The variety of food and drinks was terrific. The omlette station was fabulous. The omlette maker was tops (with his style and charisma - bam!!) and the omlettes were terrific. Lunch allows you to make good use of the small kitchen (fridge to keep the drinks cold and plenty of storage for the food/snacks). The eating area (and other furniture) was very nice. The AC worked very effectively and efficiently. The drive to Lahaina is no more than 10 minutes. Very convienient for an evening dinner run (with tons of options). While the possibilities are endless in Maui - we chose to spend a significant portion of our time at the KBC. The pool is great, the beach is literally steps away. In fact, if you rent a one of the covered \"cabanas\" (which were reasonable), you can watch the kids in parts of the pool and the beach (or all relax and enjoy some family time with a great view, but out of the sun for a bit). We enjoyed both pool and beach. Instead of chosing between the pool and beach each time you go down, they are so close, you actually do both. The slide was great for the 7 year old and we all enjoyed the water volleyball. There were plenty of beach chairs (and towels) available and the poolside bar and snack shop were closeby and very good (and reasonable). The putt-putt course was a fun time for the family. We did experience a couple of elevator hang-ups (slow elevators) - but we just went to the next tower and used the elevaors there. It was really not a big deal. And, as for the pink walls on the building, we liked the tropical feel it gave. Best of all, this was a convienient and safe environment for the family. If you have a room in the tower near the pool/beach, you can be from room to beach chair in approximately two minutes.

We did sign something at check in about the 50 dollar deposit for towels, but never had to do anything. When we wanted towels, we simply asked the front desk and that was all - NO DEPOSIT was ever requested and at the end of the day we simply put the wet towels in a basket and got fresh ones in the morning. The information in the room states that housekeeping is only twice a week unless you pay extra, but housekeeping came everyday and cleaned our room (including the dishes).

We told the concierge that we weren't interested and that was that. The concierge was helpful at booking excursions, but I recommended shopping around a bit. They do give you discounted rates, but you may be able to get even more discounted rates through the countless activity wholesalers you'll see advertised in every pamphlet or magazine.

The balcony is so small you can barely sit there on a chair, you get light headed since you are so close to the edge.

On a positive note, the grounds on the property are well kept, and the units are in decent condition. The hotel prices for food are typical for Hawaii - overpriced, mediocre food, expensive cocktail drinks in plastic glasses. The new covers on the pool chairs (they are naturally pink to match the horrible color of the hotel) are very comfy - they did not have them when we were there in May 2007 - but they are soaking wet in the morning - and it takes a while before they dry.

We didn't have an ocean view, but the space to spread out was worth it with the kids. We stocked up at Costco prior to arrival and were able to eat most meals in. The room was clean and had everything we needed. Again, it's not a 5 star, but it's more than fine if you're looking for a great location at a great price. At check-in we were invited to obtain our \"welcome gift\" at the concierge which we knew would be a timeshare pitch. We never contacted the concierge and were never asked to listen to a timeshare presentation. Another nice surprise was the free breakfast for all five of us. The booking info stated, \"free breakfast for two\", but upon check-in we were told the breakfast was for all of us. Breakfast was typical buffet food, but served its purpose. The fresh fruit was delicious. Cooked to order omelettes were available if you were willing to wait in a short line. The man cooking omelettes was quite an entertainer! My hubby waited every day and was entertained and delighted by the \"happy, joyous man\" who \"loved life and his job\" as my husband put it. A full breakfast for five people was a huge moneysaver! Yes, the elevators were a pain and the two closest to our room were out of order and we had to wait maybe five minutes for the elevators sometimes. That would be my only complaint... how minor though for spending five nights in a beautiful location for such a great rate. To make up for the slow elevators, the valet always retrieved our car in record time. We waited no more than two minutes for our car and the valets were always smiling, friendly and able to give advice if you asked. Happy hour nightly from 4:30 to 6:30 was great. Wine for $3.00 a glass and live music at the pool was super. There is a kids' menu with all items for $2.00. Not sure if that's offered all the time or just at happy hour, but what a deal. Beach views from this property are great. As with most of West Maui you can enjoy views of Lanai and Molakai. The beach was sandy and you could easily get in the water. The red flag was up the entire time we were there...not sure if this is standard practice as a [--] or if the conditions truly warranted it. Many people, including me, went in the water and had no issue. I'm a strong swimmer, but not an idiot. I would not enter the water if it seemed dangerous. Rocks are in the water about 4 - 5 feet out. We didn't snorkel here so I can't comment on that. There's a small gym overlooking the pool with brand new equipment. Hubby and I were able to work out each morning and watch the kids swimming in the pool. There are maybe 6 cardio machines and eight leg and/or arm machines. Not a lot, but in brand new condition and able to accommodate a basic workout. Property is very conveniently located to Whaler's Village as well as Honolua Bay (amazing snorkeling!). No more than a ten minute drive in either direction. There's also a Star Market across the street and within walking distance for groceries. I can't say what a great experience we had at this property. Taking your family to Hawaii is no cheap undertaking and this property makes it affordable and pleasant. I'd highly recommend it for a family or anyone wanting a nice trip, but not expecting a five star property. There seemed to be quite a few families there, so if you're looking to get away from kids, this may not be the place. If you're looking to be pampered, this may not be the place. For those desiring a nice location, nice views, nice staff this is the place.

No-one hassled us to stay when we said we already had a time-share in Mexico. So that was fine. We'll definitely be returning to this resort.

This was our first time visiting the Kaanapali Beach area, and with our children ages 7 & 10 now, we wanted to stay in resort setting. The Kaanapali Beach Club was very accommodating and was perfect for our family. We had a beautiful ocean view room on the 11th floor facing the North, toward Napili, 2nd unit from the direct ocean front. The view was incredible. We could see the coastline for miles away. The first day as we walked into our room there was a full rainbow right outside our lanai. The rooms were very nicely decorated with a Tommy Bahama Tropical theme using dark woods, granite counter tops throughout, a large bathroom with plenty of room for all four family members, without feeling crowded. The sheets, bedding and bath towels were very cozy and smelt fresh and fluffy. The kitchen offered a full refrigerator, sink & dishwasher, but no oven or stove. However, if you call House Keeping, they will be happy to bring up an electric skillet. We started our mornings off with eggs, Hawaiian toast and Kona coffee every morning on our lanai, AAAAHHHH!!! Everything was more than comfortable. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t express enough how enjoyable it was. There were many things that we loved about KBC. To name a few, the location was perfect, not overcrowded compared to The Whalers Village area. We were always able to be seated without a wait. The beach was perfect for swimming, snorkeling, boogie boarding and playing in the sand. The pool was child friendly with a small slide, rock waterfall, water volley ball and Jacuzzi. The pool offered complimentary towels and beach rentals, as well as poolside service. There are several restaurants on the property the made our stay convenient. The Ohana Grill is a ground level outdoor grill with a view of the pool and ocean with plenty of choices, as well as a $2.00 kiekie menu. The North Beach Restaurant is fine dining that is on the ground level direct ocean front with a fabulous menu. There is a caf\u00c3\u00a9 and snack bar near the pool, as well as a breakfast buffet that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t try. This resort also has a miniature golf course and an arcade.

The best snorkling (other than at Molokini), was right there in front of the resort! We stayed in a one bedroom suite and the rooms (living room and bedroom) offered great privacy with a flat screen TV in each area and the twins taking naps didn't even know of our existance in the other room (and vice versa). We discovered a small children play park along the beach just 1/2 a mile up the road from the resort, with a tide pool that is perfect for toddlers. I think this resort is very well suited for parents with children of all ages. They have remoddled the resort recently and I would certainly place this resort between a 4 and a 5 star resort. We were very impressed with the spacious suites and huge bathrooms. I found the suites and the balcony area very well cleaned and believe me my twins crawled in every area. I think an important change is that they've stopped the happy hour from Oct. 1, this year. They now only offer 3-4 drinks at a discount price between 4:30 and 6:30 pm. The resort does offer relaxing live music during this time, which is at least a perk. They still offer an incentive if you attend a 90 minute time share meeting (with no obligation to buy). The incentive is 10% off an excursion offered through the hotel and mahalo (thank you) dollars which you can use towards hotel incidental charges or excursions and restaurants ($100 to $200 depending on the season). This was welcome to us as we used it towards the parking fee they charged per day. This is the only negative I can say about this resort. They have underground valet parking, but charge you $12 per day and that does not even include the tips you'll likely be giving the valet driver. There isn't really an alternative parking. On the positive side...the valet drivers are exceptionally friendly and it's good to be greated with such friendly smiles and a cool car.

We absolutely loved it. We had two different rooms. Both had a view of the pool and the ocean. I would absolutely stay here again just based on the location. The property is beautiful. We did not encounter any problems with the elevators or anything about the hotel. The only complaint I have is that it seemed to take forever for the hot water to start working in the shower. We had the free breakfast the first morning. The food was alright.... It was a meeting to encourage you to book activities through the hotel. There was some good entertainment. The concierge staff was wonderful! I would definitely stay here again. My group stayed here because one of the people in my group was able to use her mother's time share to get us rooms. If you come and are not an owner, you will not get hit up for a timeshare presentation unless you admit to making more then 65k per year and are a homeowner. I personally would not suggest paying $12 for the buffet breakfast. I was not entirely crazy about it (potatoes were not good, eggs were average at best), although the omelette chef was very entertaining if you want to wait several minutes for an omelette (I did not). We did this once and ate breakfast in the room all other days. The drinks are also spendy. I ordered a Jack & Coke at the Ohana Bar and Grill. It came in a small disposable plastic cup and was $8.95. There is a Costco right as you are leaving the airport. Next time I go, I am stopping there first! On the drive to the hotel you will run into a Safeway at the Lahaina Cannery Mall. There is also a Star Market across the street from the hotel. It was a bit pricey (not sure if those were standard Hawaii grocery prices or not). There is also an ABC store about a block or two from the hotel as well. Parking was $12 per day and maid service was $4 per day. We had a great time in Lahaina eating at HRC and Bubba Gumps. It is fun to walk along Front St. at night, there was live music at some places. You get the beauty of Maui during the day and fun nightlife in the evening. I also highly recommend taking a kayak/snorkel trip or a snorkel cruise and taking a guided hike. The snorkeling is breathtaking!

You are eligible for a complimentary breakfast buffet the morning after you arrive if you attend their Island Orientation, which is actually quite helpful in terms of learning about and reserving activities for your trip. It was nice that we could book our activities through the resort staff and it would be charged to our room, rather than having to pay up front. The resort also offered several discounts for booking things through them. They would leave your tix at the front desk and it was that easy! We recommend renting a car if you are traveling to Maui, it came in very handy. Parking here is $12/day and there is a daily room tax of about $4-$5. You can park yourself or there is a free valet service, which we took advantage of. The breakfast buffet that the resort offers is $12.50 per person and wasn't that magnificent. The nightly manager's reception was from 4-6 and offered limited selection of free drinks and some light snacks. We only went once, and found the drinks to be too strong. The grounds there are absolutely beautiful, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The pool was never crowded and was very clean. Rooms were spacious and clean as well. The balconies are nice and long but not very wide. The bathroom was wonderful with a see-through shower and a soaking tub, as well as two sinks! Full-length mirrors on both doors of the closet in the bedroom and bathroom. TVs in the bedroom and living room. Some newer rooms had flatscreen TVs on the walls, ours were in entertainment centers but still nice. There were two restaurants on site; we tried the Ohana Bar and Grill and found the food to be quite tasty, but a little overpriced (as is everything else in Hawaii!)

Our room was a scenic-view room that overlooked the mini-golf course .. which gave me the impression that I was staying at a Motel 6 that certainly could not be located in Hawaii!!

I settled for the upgrade (the rest of my family was rather pleased with the hotel). We were moved to a room with a partial ocean view room, which actually had a beautiful view of the ocean and pond below. This room had no odor!

The beach area was so-so, but I prefer a more populated area (the best beach area is near Black Rock). The pool area was nice and my daughter enjoyed the water slide on the first day only (the following days it was run by another staff worker who very strict). The snack area / beach restaurant needs to invest in new (clean) seat cushions, and could use to lighten up on the pricing.

Since then, we have stayed here each summer sometimes for 2 weeks and lately for 1. While I would call it a resort, I certainly would not compare it to the Grand Wailea or others at this level. The KBC was once an Embassy Suites Hotel and is now is a timeshare. At this point, I think it is moslty owners staying but they do rent rooms to use capacity and to attract buyers through various deals. My family and I originally went there summer 2002 booking it as though it were an Embassy (which is a preferred accomodation when travelling as a family-- we have 3 kids)-- so we were a bit suprised at the time to find it really was a timeshare-- I think it was owned by Goldman Sachs at the time but there have been several ownership changes since then, one very recently) To me, it is still on the level of an Embassy Suites. The rooms are comfortable (I agree with some of the reviews on bedding-- mattresses are only OK and nowadays, many hotels are suppying much better mattresses). I believe all rooms have received new furniture over the last 2 years and most also have new TV's (though ours in June did not). The bathroom is huge and there is that odd feature of sliding doors in both the bath and the bedroom that you can pass through. Each room has a terrace. Some face the mountains and some are ocean front or ocean view.The kitchenette is just that-- a kitchenette. No stove, just a fridge and a microwave (and a dishwasher). It is not a condo with a full kitchen.There are a couple of grills on the ground level but in general, you cannot prepare big meals here. It fine for light breakfast or lunch. We do stay in the deluxe oceanfront and we do get a high floor each stay. The views are excellent. The grounds are clean and well maintained. For food, the grill is fine and the restaurant is good, not great. They still maintain the Embassy tradition of a free 2 hour cocktail gathering daily with limited choice. We probaly do this once or twice each week. The pool is good but is outdated based on other new hotels. The beach is decent, probably best suited for snorkeling. The elevator service can be inadequate when fixes/maintainence is underway. Rumor has it the new owner agree on the elevator issue and plans to improve. Perhaps, we'll see. We use this place primarily as accomodations. We almost never spend a day on grounds-- there's just so much to do. Napili beach for example is 5 minutes away and is routinely listed as one of the 10 best in the world. But we also drive to the other side of the island to go to McKenna, Chang's or even Fleming close by. These are among the very best beaches in the world, so why stay on grounds? Same with the pool-- it is nice but our use tends to be late afternoon when we get back from a day away. The time of year we go (late June) is definately family time. There is very little to do at night other than to walk to the Jazz bar nearby or drive into Lahaina or Kaanapali. But that's fine with us as we are a family and not seeking late nights. We stopped doing the breakfast years ago. While it has been upgraded, It does get tired and the price has tripled since we began visiting. The restaurant is pretty good-- certainly there are better in Lahaina and nearby. But we always go to it at least once. We have found the rooms and general areas to be quite clean. We have never experienced bugs but I know from friends that live in Maui that bugs are a huge issue in general due to the lush environment. We have found the staff to be friendly (agree with other reviewers that the Valet folks are tops). This may be due to our status as owners, I cannot say but have always found it this way. My wife and I visited Maui last january without the kids. We stayed at the Renaissance (due to be demolished later this year I believe) and it certainly was a true resort-- fancier, facilties, etc.. But it was also over $500 night in mid January (off season) and some of the high-end resorts in Wailea go for $700 or more in season with a smaller room. The KBC, when it rents like a hotel is considerably less expensive. Even compared to other local Timeshares (Westin, Marriot) it is not as fancy but the KBC purchase price is a fraction of these. So on balance, we love the place. It is exactly what it tries to be-- clean, nice, fair price-- and I expect we will be visiting for may years to come.", "Date": "July 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Ramon, California", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "travelfamily1", "ReviewID": "UR8214643", "Content": "We just got home after 7 days at this hotel. We booked online and got a great deal by agreeing to go through a timeshare presentation. I called ahead to request a room on a lower floor because I read about the elevator problems. We got a room on the 4th floor. The elevators were slow and sometimes not working which was very frustrating. Check in was smooth. We were pleased with our room and our partial ocean view. The bathroom was a very nice size and clean. The mini kitchen was just right for our family of 5. We went to Safeway and bought drinks and food for lunch. The bedroom was a bit outdated, the bedding was worn out and the TV was very small. The living room TV was larger although it was not a plasma as advertised. There was also a DVD player. My kids slept on the sofa bed so the sleeping arrangement was very good for our family. There were some stains and chipped paint in the room. The breakfast buffet was okay. I definitely would not pay for it. It was included in our package so we ate there most of the time. The omlette guy was very nice, but the other staff was not as friendly at breakfast. We ate dinner at the North Beach Grill one night and the food and servie was excellent. It looks like another restaurant in the evening. The pool was just okay. It needs some renovation as does a lot of the hotel. My kids enjoyed the slide and it was nice to have the beach right there. We rented a cabana for 3 days for $90. It was a great deal since the beach was so windy and it protected us from the flying sand. Plus, they do not allow other chairs on their beach. It also helped when we asked them to pull the cabana up near the pool since it was difficult to find empty chairs. The lady at the pool Barb was very nice but the other guy that works there was lazy and rude. He did not want to move our cabana and asked my son why he wanted fresh pool towels. I did not expect to be treated that way on this vacation. Luckily he was not there on the other days. The hotel grounds were kept fairly nice but certain areas could use a fresh coat of paint. Parking was not good. They were usually full or the spaces were too small. If you park at the lower level there is no elevator which made it difficult with my kids and carrying our luggage and groceries. The hotel offered a happy hour. It was simple and nothing too great, but it was free and there were many people there taking advantage of it. My kids enjoyed the miniature golf ($5 per person). We ate at some great restaurants on the island- Sansei, Pineapple Grill, Mama's Fish House (pricey but worth it for the view and location) and Aloha Plate (reasonable prices) and the North Beach Grill in the hotel. All in all, we got a great deal on this trip and I feel like we got what we paid for. Yes, there are negatives (elevators, parking, outdated bedding, the need for renovations around the hotel, certain service issues) but they are things that we could live with for the price that we paid for this vacation.

The first is that every time you visit be aware that they are always trying to sell you some thing. One of the first things you are asked when checking in is if you want to set up a meeting with your sales rep to get a \"hotel update\". What this turns into is a sales opportunity for them to upgrade your annual room package, number of weeks per year or if you are on an every other year package - converting it to an annual package. The sales issue ts so out of control that when my brother (a guest of mine) went to book an activity through the hotel, in order for him to get the 10% discount, he had to sign a form stating that if he did not show up for a 90 minute timeshare seminar that they were going to charge his credit card the discount they had extended to him. The second thing is concept of \"banking time\". If you decide that for some reason you are not able to use your package, you can \"bank\" that time with the company that manages the timeshare program. That company is RCI. The hotel and RCI are two separate entities. If you bank your time with RCI and want to use it at another date, RCI does not guarantee that the room you paid for is the one you will get. You end up getting whatever they have available. We were forced to bank one of our years due to the fact that it is virtually impossible to book any time at KBC during the summer. Although we paid for, and continue to pay maintenance fees for an ocean front unit, the only thing we were able to get was a \"garden room\" that slept less people. When I called the resort to complain, they said they have nothing to do with this and call RCI. If you really want to buy one of these units, I would strongly recommend looking on eBay.

We checked in on Friday June 8th at 3:30 (check in is at 4:00) and were told our room was not ready. My step son got sick on the way from the airport to the hotel and when I told the desk lady that she talked to her manager and they were able to get us into a room right then (on a lower floor but still with an ocean view). We were told the room we were originally booked into was on the 7th floor but was an unrenovated room. We found out later all that means is the rooms on the 4th floor and higher don't have the flat screen tv's otherwise everything else is the same. The rooms are very nice and spacious. The air conditioning works great! There is a dvd player and a small cd player in the bedroom. There is a microwave, large refrigerator, coffee pot and toaster. They will bring coffee for one pot every day and will restock creamer and sugar daily too. House keeping will take your trash out and bring fresh towels every day. They come to do a full clean about 4 days after you arrive. We weren't terribly impressed with the full clean...we had to have them come back and clean both sliders (full of kid prints) the closet mirrors in the bathroom and bring a top sheet (w/o an unknown stain) for the pull out bed. To their credit they came back and did all that right away. They also brought me xtra hangers the first day w/i 15 min of my call. The kids LOVED the pool and water slide! The beach was also very nice. There is alot of reef shallow on the beach so water shoes are a good idea. We rented a boogie board and snorkeling gear. The equipment is $5 a day per person. The kids really enjoyed using it. It was a little frustrating that by 10:30-11:00 most of the chase lounges had towels on them indicating they were taken. Also they ask that you don't take the chase lounges onto the beach. You can reserve a covered seat/lounge on the beach but there are only about 10 of these and fill up fast. The activities desk was very helpful and booked several activities for us and gave us directions etc. We ate at the Ohana Grill three times and thought the food was pretty good. ALL food on Maui is expensive. We ate all breakfasts in the room and several lunches. We ordered pizza up to our room one night and it too was expensive.

We have been to this property 3 other times when it was owned and operated by Embassy Suites. It has now been bought out by Sunterra Properties, and is quite a bit different. The staff - with the exception of the housekeeping and a few of the valet parking guys - were unfriendly and business-like. The staff that ran the morning breakfast were by far the worst. They walked around and monitored what everyone was doing. You could no longer seat yourself, bring food to your room, eat outside in the outdoor balcony, and most of all, even bring your own coffee (starbucks) in. No longer is everyone's breakfast free. Two adults are included in the price only. Any child 12 and under will be required to pay $12.00 a day. As for the happy hour this property offers, that too has changed. You used to be able to at least bring non-alcoholic beverages out of the area (soda's etc.) No more! They have a guard-dog at the door who states that if you want to drink anything, you do it within their confined area. You are not allowed to bring any chairs or chase lounges on the beach. If you would like to sit on the beach you can pay $35.00 a day for a wooden double chase lounge that is covered, but expect to return it promptly at 5:00PM. This is extremely hard, especially when the property right next door (the Kaanapali Suites) allows their guests to move chairs and chase lounges directly on the beach. Nothing is for free at this hotel. Not even a small kick board to use in the pool. The rooms have been renovated. They are very nice, except the master bedroom lacks privacy. There are three ways into the master, two of which can lock, and one way through the closet, that can not. The pool is large, but incredibly boring. No bells and whistles. The guy who mandates the one water slide closes down for some of the afternoon to take lunch. With a property that big you'd think they'd have two people who could rotate, in order to keep it open for the kids. All in all, it's not a bad property, but with the new management the energy appears negative, over-controlling, and business-like. If I had to sum up how the new management has dictated this property be run, if would be this way: The almighty dollar rules the roost. It's definately apparent that this is a business and their main concern is keeping costs down and maintaining rigid control (especially in the breakfast department.) One last quick note. There's far too many properties on Maui that have a higher priority for pleasing their guests. The smiles on their faces are genuine and they appear to take pride in welcoming you to their island. Check them out. Unfortunately, this is not one of them any longer. The dinners at the North Beach Grill are fairly reasonable, but again the atmosphere appears tense and unfriendly. We found outselves going to dinner at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel a number of times.

I have been to Hawaii many times and have never had an experience as this one. We were invited to go to Hawaii with our son and family. As we are going on another big trip with the family in June we wanted to go without spending a lot of money. We were invited by Embassy Suites to a timeshare property at a reasonable rate and decided to stay at this hotel since it was close to where my son and family were staying. We arrived at the hotel to check in after flying all day and were greeted by a gentleman that must have had a bad day. We went to our room and thought our bathroom was strange to say the least but we ran out to meet our son. When we got back to the room we went right to sleep and in the morning I realized they had put us in a handicap room. No tub, one sink, shower all one with the bathroom. We asked for a change of room and they said they only had one and we had to share the balcony with another room. Not satisfactory to us but got absolutely no satisfaction with anyone behind the desk. Finally we went to the promotion people where we signed up for our room and they were wonderful and changed our room after losing a day of our trip waiting to move. The one thing that was very nice and good size were the rooms once we got a regular room in the renovated area. Breakfast everyday was somewhat of a zoo unless you arrived early. I did not care for the buffet food but did hear people say they liked it so to each his own. Our experience with the timeshare people was awful as by this time we would never buy anything in this hotel. We sat down with the realtor and told her the problems we had with the hotel and she left and brought over the manager. High pressure and downright insulting us telling me some people had open minds and some didn't. Where do you think he put us? Yes you are right and applied all the pressure he could which made the situation worse. WE DID NOT BUY! The conciege desk did not help us and knew nothing about restaurants and were not very helpful or pleasant. They just wanted to sell where they made money and not help the customer.

One last thing - the facility offers some activiites for a fee - I wanted to do the lei making and didn't realize we had to sign up ahead of time - then, the class on our last day there was filled up.

My family of 2 adults and 3 kids ages 7,7, and 10 just returned from a 7 night stay. We arrived on 3/25/07. We were in Lokahai Tower, room # 332. Frankly, I liked being on a lower floor. We booked and received a \"scenic\" view. On the lanai, you could see the sidewalk and the West Maui mountains. I thought the view was fine. We didn't spend tons of time in the room anyway. Let me begin by saying the resort is CLEAN. I even saw men cleaning the grout with special brushes in all the areas that had tile. I was impressed. Pool and other public areas were IMMACULATE, and I am picky. Our unit was renovated with LOVELY plasma TV's, a HUGE bathroom, NICE fixtures, and a kitchenette. We asked for and received an electric frying pan and a rice cooker. We ate several meals in the unit to save $. We did NOT attend the nightly FREE cocktail hour...not interested as we do not drink. Included in our package was breakfast for 2 each day. I REALLY like a breakfast package. I HOPE they will reconsider how they do the breakfast, though. PLEASE...just give everyone breakfast. This is NOT a cheap place to stay. I bought breakfast for my 3 kids at $6 per day. Not much $, but the whole process was time consuming each day. They were given tickets, they had to check our room # on a BIG list, mark the tickets, etc. I wish they would just give it up! Give everyone breakfast just like the cocktail hour! That said, the choices were good. The omlette guy was a hoot! Very kind and funny man. Plenty of fruit, eggs, waffles, oatmeal, etc. Choices varied a bit each day. I enjoyed eating there and watching the whales and surf with my family. Another thing I LOVED was the valet parking. The valets were KIND, funny, and helpful. I felt spoiled. We felt like royalty for 7 days with this service. There was, of course, a charge. $12 a day. Again, I wish this fee would be included in the room price as you feel nickled and dimed to death sometimes. The pool was WONDERFUL. My 3 kids LOVED it and the waterslide. The pool was the PERFECT depth for them. It was hard to get them to go into the ocean with such a great pool. For older kids it might not be as exciting, but with my kids it was a HIT. They had lots of fun with many other kids and adults over 7 days. Things I didn't like: $.85 cents for a phone call. Please! $12 per day fee on the valet parking $6 per day for each kid to eat breakfast Just get rid of the silly charges and charge me more for the room! Ohana Grill and Bar on property...worst pizza I have ever had! tried dinner there, too...VERY mediocre! Overall, we had a WONDERFUL time.

Also, both pool tables, the air hockey table and 5 of the video games were broken in the game room. The breakfast buffet was great-fresh fruit and decent assortment of breakfast items, changing daily. The restaurants on site were really good. The pool was decent and there is a separate, smaller pool that has a waterslide, which was fun for the kiddies. The beach was nice, but narrower than I expected. Word of warning-I had the WORST mexican food I have ever had at the mexican restaurant in the shopping center that was walking distance from the hotel. Yuck! We did the timeshare presentation to get $200 in vouchers and to have our son enrolled in the kids club for free. Of course we did not buy, but what they did not tell us was that Sunterra was in the process of selling off its European properties.

The small kitchen contained a dish washer, refrigerator, and microwave (all whirlpool brand) and had granite countertops. The bathroon was pleanty large with a granite topped vanity and sink on one end and a pedastool sink on the other. The bathroom has new ceramic tile as well as a seperate shower and jacuzzi tub. The furniture was nice in the front room consisting of a sofa and two oversized chairs with an adjacent table and 4 chairs in the eating area. The best part of the rooms in my opinion is the fact that there were two 37\" plasmas hanging on the wall in the suite, one in the bedroom and one in the front room. The suite also had a DVD player and receiver that was meant to be for music, however, with a little rewiring you can connect to the TV and rent movies from the video store accross the main road. The breakfast was good, but like anything anything else it gets old after a while and all tastes the same. When its all said and done, if you can get this on a timeshare promotion you can't find a better deal out there. The timeshare wasn't bad, but after saying no 4 times my wife got really short with the lady and told her we had to leave.

As other people have mentioned this special rate is in exchange for sitting through a 90 minute timeshare presentation. I want to preface this by saying that we are low-maintnance guests - when we read reviews of this hotel on tripadvisor before the vacation we were rolling our eyes at folks who complained about the quality of the free snacks at the happy hour (c'mon - they are FREE). We assumed people that complained about the staff were just high-maintenance people who expected to be treated like they were at the Westin. Well, once we were at the hotel we understood. The front desk staff, for the most part, is quite rude. It was standard for them to say nothing and just stare at you when you walked up to the front desk. When you asked a question or made a request the response was often exasperated. It just seemed as if all of these people were really not fond of their jobs. That said most of the other staff was friendly - the waiters, the concierge, the happy hour bartenders were all nice. The hotel is in a pretty good location but the beach out front isn't too hot - while we were there they had the red warning flag up the entire time. I have a feeling they may leave it up all winter since it was even up when the ocean was calm and toddlers were wading around without incident. The hotel was built in 1988 and it looks like it. It's pink with aqua tile - very Miami vice. The rooms were fine - quite big and although we had a renovated room the furniture itself had not been replaced - it was pretty cheesy and the bed was REALLY uncomfortable. Maybe the new beds are better, but neither of us had quality sleep the entire stay. The grounds are nice, not extensive, but nice with a big pool and plenty of space to lay out by the pool in the sun or shade. The free happy hour every night is okay - granted the snacks consist of a party mix made up of cheetos, doritos, sunchips and pretzels, but as I said earlier - it's free. The happy hour takes place in an area of the lobby that was maybe a bar once - but now all it's used for is the happy hour. Basically from 4-6 every day it's a bunch of (mostly) elderly people sitting indoors (at outdoor furniture sets) drinking out of plastic cups and eating out of paper dishes. We are not ones to walk away from free booze, but we skipped this on more than one occasion in favor of paying for drinks somewhere with a view and nice atmosphere. All and all - the place is fine. We had no big problems, and it was a nice place for a home base from which we had a great vacation. It is just a little old and it feels like it - despite the renovations. If we had paid any more than we did, I definitely would have felt that I overpaid. The average guest is probably in their 60s - if you are looking for a young crowd you won't find it here. The timeshare presentation was longer than 90 minutes - we were there for over 2 hours and finally just had to get up and start leaving before they took no for an answer (it is NOT a good deal). After we made it clear we were not buying we were offered another great deal for a weeklong stay at another resort in the Sunterra family next year and we took that. Oh, and lastly - I'd skip the in-house salon.

When we arrived two hours early a room was ready and when we mentioned that it was our honeymoon we were up graded to an ocean view on the 12th floor and a bottle of champange was sent to our room. So, I'm unsure how people can say the front desk is unpleasant. They were more than willing to anwser any questions and with a smile. When we got to our room we were amazed. It was huge, clean, and more than enough room for two. I must say I didn't find the sheets on the bed to be a problem and I thought the bed was quite comfortable. We enjoyed the FREE cocktail hour daily and the FREE chips. It's free why complain and the chips were mighty tasty. We meant several wonderful couples espically one honeymooning at the resort and actually ended up booking several activities with one couple through Mark at the activity desk. Mark was very helpful and set us up with great snuba, helicpoter, and luai trips. The beach is small but you can lay on it and swim in the water. I guess you might complian if you sit at the resort all day. THe pool was more than nice. Yes, the slide is small but I'm 28 and thought it was fun. We did participate in the timeshare presentation. I have to say that they did try and pressure us and were quite obessive with selling. I don't think it's worth the discounts that you get. The only negative I could say is that the elevators take forever. Hope this helps. All I can say is the place is great and in the perfect area. It's not really a place to party.

Got a good deal for 4 nights and paid for an upgrade to an ocean view. Our flight was early so we got to the Embassy before rooms were available. We received friendly greetings from both the valet parking attendants and the front desk. The front desk staff was particularly friendly as we had told her specifically the type of room we wanted (upgrades, king bed and ocean view which we had of course paid for). She said she would work on it and offerred to call us on our cell when a room was ready. So we left our luggage and went to Whaler's Village for lunch. We got a call within the hour. Our suite was on the 11th floor, updated and larger than we expected. A nice sized living room/dining room combination, with an open style kitchenette. Oddly though the kitchen had a normal sized fridge, microwave and dishwasher with dishes etc but no stove top. While a coffee maker was provided, no kettle for us tea drinkers. Housekeeping did not have one to offer either. The bathroom was gorgeous with two sinks, a large walk in shower and closed off toilet area. The long narrow balcony overlooked the ocean from two angles. Lovely. Only problem was there was no screen for the door so leaving the doors open at night was not an option because of the bugs. The bedroom was a nice size with a small tv and ample closet and drawer space. While the suite was upgraded, was surprised that the bedding was old school, flat sheet. With all of today's hotels at all levels upgrading their bedding to duvets etc, not sure why Embassy isnt doing the same. Another minor point is about their happy hour. Previous reviewer is correct, bar staff could be friendlier and can upgrade their snacks (come on cheese chips in a bowl?). I was expecting a poor beach by the way it was described in other reviews so was pleasantly surprised that it was nice enough to sit at, swim in etc. Another minor point is the Embassy doesnt let you take the loungers down to the beach and if you want one with they have on the beach there is a $15 hefty fee for two. Also found that the lounge chairs which were provided did not seem to be cleaned. Minor point but one to note when you are trying to upgrade the facility. Location is ok (about 10 minutes to Whalers Village and, another 10 to Lahaina depending on traffic). Shopping plaza across the street is good and definitely go up to the next plaza and get the fantastic take out food from the Okosawa (sp?) Deli. The mahi mahi with lemon caper sauce is incredible!! We were obligated to do the time share presentation because of the referral but also got $200 in coupons that were good at several good restaurants (Mama's!!) and shopping (Hilo Hatties). The presentation took 90 minutes, no pressure (we already own time share somewhere else) and while tempting no-one should ever have to make such a decision as this type of purchase in a short period of time as they tend to expect.

My findings were as follows: Bell/valet/maid service=attentive, cordial, courteous; front desk = prompt, professional, courteous at all hours of the day and night (jet lag!); grounds = clean, well-maintained; restaurants = grill is fine, not fancy, is pool-side and main restaurant is 4-star quality with excellent service and commensurate prices; beach = narrower than down south but busy with lots of guests; pool = huge, in much use, attractive but not posh; wind more than down south (Lahaina and Whaler's village area), but as one who is used to wind, I prefer it to a humid calm; suite was huge with a large full wrap-around lanai and four sliding windows. The south side was easily 8-10 feet of depth to the patio; kitchen lacks a cooktop or oven, (no complaints from the cook); but has full refrigerator, microwave, and dishwasher. I would suggest they add stackable washer/dryers in the 2-bedroom units, as they are the furthest from the coin-op machines, and, with more guests, are more likely to be used. There are only 18 2-bedrooom suites in the whole complex, with the remaining 400 being 1-bedroom. Of the latter, about 44 are scenic view, 50 are ocean front, and the remainder are ocean view. This is a young family resort, only a block from a large grocery store and a busy strip mall with alternate restaurant options. Kids older than 13 will probably be bored as it is far from the Ka'anapali beach action, not to mention Lahaina. Also, owners are treated very well, with complimentary parking and discounts at all merchants and restaurants. There are a number of units available from resale agents locally and over the Internet, so don't be pressured by the salesmen on site.

We were on the 2nd floor so we took the stairs most of the time. I don't know why the walkways leading to the rooms are so dirty; I saw a suspicious dark red splotch on the floor leading to our room every day we were there. The room was not a remodeled room, so it was as clean as they could get it, but it still felt slightly grimy. The refrigerator was spotless which was great. They were wonderful with the maid service and they were more than generous with the towels which was great. Why they can't use a fitted sheet instead of flat I'll never know, but it was kind of irritating. The service everywhere was pretty bad. We didn't valet, so I don't know about them but the front desk people acted like they'd been trained to not care. We went to the happy hour once and the bartender was so disgruntled and tossed our drinks to us in such a rude way, we felt like cattle. Even the receptionist at the spa was slightly chilly. (but my husband and I got the best massages ever, so don't let the receptionist scare you away). The only person in the whole place who looked like he enjoyed his job was the omelette maker at breakfast. If you've been there you know what I mean. Great personality. Speaking of breakfast, it was fair. On our last day the eggs and sausage were cold. But the omelettes were always great and the fruit and pastries were good. The potaoes, egg and breakfast meat were hit and miss. We stayed on a timeshare presentation deal, so we got a great deal on the room. The presentation was extremely low pressure. So low pressure in fact that the lady was practically begging us to tell her we weren't going to buy so she could find someone else to talk to. We were actually curious and wanted details, but we had to beat the info out of her. She wasn't very good, because her questions made me feel stupid and even stupider when I answered them. Needless to say, we didn't buy. Overall, I would say there are much nicer places to stay in Kaanapali, but if you're on a budget and get a good deal, you will have a nice stay. We loved the amenities, nice pool and towel service. The location on the beach is great, we did some wonderful snorkeling right in front of the Embassy and saw lot of beautiful fish.

Many other reviews we read are dead on. Place is not luxurious but also not a dump--it is accurately an Embassy Suites (though it isn't). Staff is not particularly friendly (not rude, but not happy employees either) or particularly conscientious. Not particularly well maintained (the parking garage floor is spotless, but the common areas of the hotel floors were pretty dirty-what's with that?). For example, there are dishwashers in every room. On one the day that our room was to be cleaned, I ran the dishwasher after breakfast. The maid did not unload it, she just added the coffeemaker to the clean dishes and re-ran it (the dishes were still hot from being washed when she came in). Lazy... Breakfast is really expensive ($12/person) and not wonderful (canned orange juice and pineapple juice in Hawaii?). Other meals were pricey for what was served. Beds are ok, but bottom sheet is a flat sheet, and they only clean the room once a week, so you are stuck remaking the bed every day and waking up on the mattress itself. A false fire alarm went off at 4 am for 1/2 hour with loud announcements (I have seen several other complaints about this). Our ocean view room was really a view of the parking lot, though if you went out on the balcony and leaned over you could see the ocean. Water slide was lame, and only my six year old thought it was fun. Rained on this hotel for 2 days but not at the neighboring hotels (it is very weird but rain only feel in a small area of the island, on this hotel and another one). Not a particularly good area to play in the ocean due to the tides, and water was murkier here than most other stretches we saw, again due to tides and reef structure. The concierge booked our children for hula lessons both by phone and in person when we got there. We went to the lesson to be told that there hadn't been hula lessons in months. Unfortunately, we were too late to go to another location for one. Finally, avoid the time share sales pitch. It is 3 hours long (not 1 1/2 hours). Further, they should give you a $250 allowance towards activities if you attend the time share meeting, but if you bbook through the hotel, they will only give you $150. Otherwise, hotel was fine.

We came from the Hilton Hawaiian Village (Oahu) and then the best hotel in the universe, Hotel Hana-Maui. We were really appalled by the reception from the bellhop(s) at valet and the AWFUL reception desk staff. We brought our car into valet, opened the doors, popped the trunk, opened back doors... the three valets without any other customers just continued their conversation as we unloaded. It got to the point that I thought it could possibly be Candid Camera: Maui. The possible Candid Camera charade continued as we were found our way to the reception desk (through a gorgeous open-air lobby). I went to the \"Owners Express CHECK-IN ONLY\" labeled line. Seriously, that was the sign above the line. The recepionist just looked at me, so I said, \"Hi! Bradds, B-R-A-D-D-S.\" He continued to STARE at me, so I repeated our last name and spelling slowly. Finally he said, \"What do you want from me?\" I literally rechecked the sign above me to make sure I wasn't possibly in the \"Sign up for the underwater basket weaving class here\" sign, and said, \"Checking in.\" Let's just say the conversation went downhill from there. He literally said, \"The computer couldn't possibly be right. It says you are owners.\" Ok, so I wasn't dressed in Prada, but come on! Who says that!!!!?? Well, I was sad that we had left the Hotel Hana-Maui, and it's PERFECT customer service, so I thought I might have had a bad taste in my mouth or maybe a bias. Sadly, I was mistaken... the service at the breakfast buffet were Nazi-like (\"No! You may not come in. It is 9:31! We close at 9:30. Doesn't matter if you have breakfast ticket.\" to the couple behind us in line, no kidding.) Well, deluxe ocean front was a stretch, but it was a beautiful room. The bed stunk, they also use one flat sheet instead of a fitted one, so it was all wrapped around us all night... and they only change/fix linens once a week, so it was kind of a hassle. If you are still reading this, there are really nice things about the Embassy - great pool!!! Lots of seats, towels, very clean, nice wait staff and excellent frozen drinks (although lunch was $12 chicken sandwiches). We also thought the grounds were in need of some maintenence - peeling paint, etc - but overall beautiful!!! Our housekeeper was genuinely a little piece of sunshine when she changed our towels daily. The valet ended up doing a great job. The location of the Embassy is a few minutes north of Ka'anapali - we thought it was a great location ($20 cab ride to Lahaina).

The first point of contact (at Embassy Suites) with the employees who never greeted us as we had been received at the airport and the car rental facility was very dishartning. The non greeting staff set the precedence for our stay at the facility. The customer service has alot of training to brush up on. We too signed up for the package deal thru our travel agent. We booked 6 months in advance for a group of 16 people consisting of 4 different families. We were spread out over three different floors, We requested King size beds in all the rooms, I checked in first and received the correct bedding on the 2nd floor. The next family checked in and was given a room on the 10th floor with two double beds. When asked why we were not receiving the rooms closer together and the accomodations we requested. We were told we pay for the room not the accomodations. Have you every heard anything so ridiculous from a supposedly \"5 star facility\". The next family checked in again on the 10th floor and the final family was given a room on the 5th floor. And guess what it was a miracle! They were given a room with a King size bed. How was this possible when they are overbooked and they have nothing available, they are sending people to other hotels. What a bunch of BS! They probably would have not hesitated to send part of our party to another hotel with no consideration of our group. We spent alot of time away from the facility. We as a group had discussed this trip for about two years and planned it six months in advance. We like to do things right. I can say that had we been better received, all four families probably would have purchased the timeshares. They missed out not only on our business but on future business as well. We are all Business Professionals who have alot of work Colleagues who were looking forward to our return. There is nothing nice to say except, stay at the Sheraton or the Hyatt in Lahaina for the best value for your dollar.

We stayed on the minivac, which was a great value. We got 6 nights, plus rental car, breakfast buffet and tickets to a luau ((Drums of the Pacific) for about $1300! That's a great price for that area. We had a one-bedroom, one bath condo with mini kitchen. The room itself was quite nice, the view very nice, the pool and beach, were, in my opinion, great, the breakfast quite nice. Would we come back again? Not on your life! The problem was the staff and their attitude. The whole point of the minivac package (this place usually goes for $400/nt) was to entice you to buy one of their units, and you had to sit through a timeshare presentation. Fair enough. Actually, the ts people were quite nice and informative and we enjoyed the presentation. They weren't the problem--the hotel staff was the problem. They acted like we were some sort of nuisance from the moment we arrived. The valet parking was about the worst experience I had in my life while traveling. When we arrived, tired and stressed, they didn't even smile or say \"Welcome\". Instead, they made quite an issue of filling out a damage report on our rental vehicle so they wouldn't be charged for any previous damage. They didn't even help unload our bags, and actually attempted to drive off while we were unloading! They loaded our bags onto a cart, pushed it into the lobby, and it just sat there for about 20 minutes with no offer from anyone to bring it up to the room, so we finally assumed we were supposed to take it up ourselves. Well, we did, then got a phone call asking us to bring their cart back down, and informing us it was against their rules for guests to use their carts. Well, why didn't they tell us that as we were taking it--obviously they knew who we were, or how could they call us? I told them if they wanted it they could come get it. Then, a few minutes later, our phone stopped working. We also discovered that Internet service didn't work. I I had to walk all the way back down to the main lobby to complain and was told to go back to the room and call them when it was working!!!! From what, a phone that didn't work? I insisted I wasn't leaving the lobby until it was verified the phone was working. I spoke with the manager, who told me they had other guests to attend to, I wasn't the priority, they would send up someone to repair it when they \"got a chance\". I asked if we could be transferred to another room and was told the only rooms available were ocean views and my package only included a mountain view. I pointed out that our pacaage did include a working phone! They then told me if I was so unhappy I could find another hotel! I told them that would be fine if they would make the arrangements and we wouldn't be charged anything more. Finally they fixed the phone, but it took about 3 days to get Internet service going. The servers at the breakfast buffet acted like the guests were a nuisance. Lines were backing up while tables were empty. They never came over to clear away used dishes or bring coffee, water refills (took forever to bring the first ones). Finally we put our used dishes on a nearby clean table and got up to get our own drinks, for which we were told not to do that, it was \"against their rules for guests to serve themselves\". Every time we used valet parking they acted annoyed, rushed (although they weren't busy and valets were just standing around talking). We were seriously considering buying a ts and might have been talked into it by the Sunterra people, who, like I said, were quite nice, however, we had a taste of the place and wouldn't want to come back for more. We spoke with several owners while there who agreed that the attitude and level of service were quite poor. Also, they advertise that they have laundry facilities on site, which is technically true. One washer and two dryers every other floor, no a/c in the laundry unit (just a little aclove off the hallway) no change machine, dirty laundry tubs and dirty machines.

When we arrived, the rooms that we were supposed to be in were not available, so we went to the cocktail happy hour. It was fine, but nothing special. Beer, sodas, Mai Tais, Rum Punch, Margeritas, etc, but no blended or special order drinks. Basically, they had bottles of tequila, rum, vodka and mixers. There was also a chip mix to snack on, but nothing more. Eventually, our rooms were ready, and they were able to upgrade us to a 12th (top) floor ocen view suite. The suite itself is very nice. Quite large with a mini-kitchen, a large living area with a pull-out sofa and a separate bedroom with a King bed (or 2 doubles). There was also a patio overlooking the ocean...very nice! The bathroom was very large, recently remodeled with granite and new tile, but offered no privacy. There is room for 10 people in the bathroom, but there are no walls or separators. Also the closet from the bedroom opens up into the bathroom, thereby decreasing the privacy even more. Not a big deal if it is just you and your honey, but something to keep in mind if you are travelling with kids/teens. The kitchen has a full-sized fridge, a microwave and a sink (with no garbage disposal). A cooktop (or range) is sorely missing, as is a decent trash can. The hotel itself is technically on Kaanapali beach, but it is about a mile north of the \"real\" Kaanapali Beach where the Sheraton, Marriott and Hyatt are. The beach here (at least during the week we were there) was unusable. The surf and wind were both extremely high which made for very dangerous conditions. As I understand it, it is ALWAYS very windy at the Emabssy, while that is not true a mile South. The beach at the hotel is also very narrow, and doesn't offer much room to lay out or play. The pool is very big, but there are no \"features\" and there is little shade. There is a waterfall pool (sorta cool) and a kids pool as well. The slide they advertise is for little kids only and empties into the kids pool...nothing special unless you are under 6. The pool area has lots of chairs and a few umbrellas, but the pool is not a \"happenning\" place as it is at some other resorts. There are very few people hanging out, and there is no poolside food or beverage service. There are also no pool activities or planned events. Our package included a breakfast buffet which was alright, and certainly worth the price. The hotel overall seemed like it needed to be remodeled. The railings throughout the hotel were rusty/dirty, the windows on the top of the atriums were so dirty that you couldn't see through them, the bathroom (even though recently remodeled) had mildew in the tile grout, and the pool chairs needed to be cleaned or replaced. Again, nothing was horribly dirty or gross, but you could definitely see the age of the place. The staff also was just OK. No one was mean or rude, and all of our needs were met, but no one went the extra mile. They did what they had to do, but nothing more. The sales presentation was fine, although our sales rep (Annie) wasn't able to answer my questions about the details of the program. At the end (after we said no), they offered us another week at their Kauii resort for $1165, which I purchased. Overall, we had a great time, and for the price, I can't complain.

I purchased my timeshare sight unseen. I had been to Maui a couple of times in the last year and after falling in love with the island, decided to look into timeshares. I stayed at my new timeshare this past week, from March 6th-13th. From the moment we arrived, we loved the place. The lobby area is open with beautiful, colorful birds and ponds filled with koi. You will find many sofas and chairs to lounge in at this level and also in the lower level. I saw people using their laptops for wireless internet in the lobby areas. The suites have been nicely renovated. The tile in the kitchen and bath room has the appearance of stone. The counter tops were granite slab. I was very happy with the roominess of the suite. I checked out a Marriott Suite and it just didn't compare. The Embassy's suites are larger, with more counter space in the kitchen and a full size fridge as opposed to a half size that fit under the counter. The bathroom at the Embassy was huge and the bathroom at the Marriott was teeny tiny. There is a room safe, 2 T.V.'s, DVD, stereo, hair dryer, full size fridge, microwave, dishwasher, dishes , silverware, Mr. Coffee, and toaster in the suites. Sure the Marriott has a nicer beach, but that wasn't as important to me. If a bigger sandy beach is more important than the accomodations, then you will want to look elsewhere. Although, this beach was big enough for me, I can see that it lacks the appeal of other nicer beach areas. The swimming pool was very large with a slide and smaller pool for children. The restaurants were just okay. Nothing to write home about, yet, I had eaten at many other places in Lahaina and Whaler's Village and have not found anything that makes me want to return. Prices are higher, but that is to be expected in Maui. We bought a case of drinks at Costco before leaving Kahului and shopped at Star Market across the street from the Embassy for breakfast foods. It saved on some of the food bill during our stay. The Embassy has a manager's reception each evening with a snack mix of cheetos, doritos, etc. The drink choices were beer, mai tai's, margaritas, wine, and rum punch. We discovered we enjoyed the margaritas. It saved on our liquor bill having our before dinner drinks there. The staff were very accommodating in every way. All were pleasant. Jose in the outdoor grill area was a lot of fun. He was an excellent server with a nice sense of humor. Parking was not as treacherous as I had read. It isn't any worse than a parking garage in San Francisco. As owners, we didn't have to pay the $12 per day fee.

It is not in the same class as, for example, the Hyatt, Four Seasons, etc. So, if you are expecting that level of \"resort\" you will be disappointed. However, for what it offers the Embassy is an excellent choice for your stay on Maui. Finally, the Embassy is trying to sell timeshare units.

We bought peanut butter and jelly, fruit, drinks, popcorn, spaghetti-O's, beer, soda and laundry detergent. Laundry room on even numbered floors. 4-6pm free manager's cocktail party near the lobby, the limited drinks were very good and the only snack was party mix. You can bring down your own crakers and cheese. Pool- big, clean, plenty of lounge chairs with a slide, volleyball net, hot tub and waterfall. Towel service. Beach-nice, clean. Little ones swim in the morning, very calm water. Bigger ones later in the day, the wind picks up and so does the surf. But it's still summer so not very good waves for body boards. Snorkle right off the beach. Rent equip. from an off-resort shop for under $15 for the week. This way you have it when you go anywhwere else on the island.

We went out of Philly, long plane ride, if you have recently potty trained child or heavy sleeper, bring a pull-up or 2 and change of clothes in your carry-on. My little one wore a pull up on the way home (night flight). It saved me a hassle. Old Lahaina Luau-good for adults not so much for kids. Very traditional. Very nice show but not enough action and kids didn't like food, went to MdDonalds afterwards. Try luau with fire batons. Also kids liked the Magic Show Kapanaha very much, lots of fun.

We cannot fit comfortably in a standard hotel room, so the suite concept is perfect for us. We were fortunate enough on this visit to get an updated room which was nicely decorated.

The kids thought it was fun to get the snacks and have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153drinks\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We are pretty easy to please. I do not consider this a budget hotel. It is in Hawaii, so everything is beautiful. It is also not as plush as some of the Kaanapali hotels such as the Hyatt. However, we saved a lot of money on breakfast and the cost of getting two hotel rooms. The kitchenette was great also. There was a full sized refrigerator which we filled with drinks, fruit, and the makings for one or two meals. After being at the beach all day, it was great to relax in the room with a simple meal. On this visit, we were able to swim at the beach right by the hotel. When we last visited, in the winter, the water was much too wild to safely swim. The casual restaurant by the pool was pretty good. We were able to eat and watch the sunset while my older children swam in the pool.

I wasn't able to immediately tell if our room had been refurbished or not, but it was clean, spacious and comfortable for our family of 2 adults and 3 children under 10. Our kitchen consisted of a pretty good sized mini-fridge, a microwave, sink, toaster and coffee maker. They also provided, plates, bowls, glasses, and utensils. If we left dirty glasses in the sink, the maid service replaced them with clean ones. The beach was close and convenient, however, we didn't find it to be one of the better beaches in the area. It was very narrow and there are quite a few rocks/stones right when you walk into the water. We found much nicer beaches just north or south of where the resort is. The pool was very large. We never had a problem finding chairs or feeling overcrowded in the pool. Our kids enjoyed the water slide that they had. One issue we had was that the childrens pool was marked as 3.5 feet deep, and it seemed to get deeper in the middle. It was too deep to let our 4 year play in without an adult right by his side. Our family really enjoyed the breakfast and happy hour provided by the resort. The breakfast allowed us to quickly grab food in the morning and had something to satisfy all of our appetites. They typically provided a variety of fresh fruit, some baked goods, pancakes or french toast, scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon and some potato dish. Additionally they had mini-bagels with cream cheese, toast, cereals and a variety of juice. There seemed to be enough variety to satisfy most people. We were also able to take slices of bread and peanut butter and jelly packets to our room to occasionally make sandwiches for lunch. One of our kids favorite times of the day was the happy hour. They provided a good variety of drinks with and without alcohol. As some others have mentioned there was some snack mix available. This usually helped our kids last until dinner. There was also some musical entertainment from 5-6pm each night. We did find that there was a rather long wait for elevators and 2 of the 6 elevators were not working during our stay.

We've stayed there 3 more times since then. I give a mixed review. I love: the rooms- spacious, perfect for families, wonderful bathrooms, showers and tubs, kitchenette is just right, and grounds are lovely. We also enjoy the tropical bird collection they have on display each day, the great large-sized pool, and the un-crowded beach. On the negative side, we've seen the physical condition of the hotel deteriorate over the years. Two of the 6 elevators were non-functioning the whole 2 weeks we were there. An employee told us she'd been working there for 4 months and she'd never seen those elevators run. We overheard a timeshare salesperson saying that bank of elevators \"are being refurbished\". We were there during spring break and often had to wait a very long time for an elevator. Furniture in the casual restaurant was very run-down and food there was expensive and not good. The nice restaurant was high priced and we never took a chance on trying it. We figured if they couldn't make a decent club sandwich at the casual restaurant we didn't want to waste money at their expensive place. The free breakfast is ok, but they didn't seem to make any accomodations for the big spring-break crowds and we often had to wait in very long lines for the breakfast. As for a previous review saying that this place was filled with older people; I think it really depends on the time of year that you are visitng. We're often there during school break times and it's filled with families with kids. This time, we stayed a while longer, and yes, we did notice the crowd shift from families to more older couples. We didn't see many young couples there. The pool is very large, especially compared to the postage-stamp pools at all the condo complexes surrounding the Embassy. The pool never felt crowded and it was never a problem to find a chair. The beach there is narrow, but the sand is clean and soft and there are no crowds. Service- generally good, though on our first day we switched rooms with my folks who were traveling with us. We called and went down to the desk right away to let them know of our switch. They never did get it right and it caused some confusion when trying to make room charges etc. throughout our stay. We've visited so often, I feel like we should take advantage of time-share ownership.

We enjoyed the food at the Ohana Grill located next to the pool it was tasty and well priced. Our favorite by far was renting one of the four gazebos for the day which are located in between the pool and beach. A great location to be able to watch the kids in the pool or at the beach, and a great shady area for those that need it.

We were in a non - renovated room and I did not find the rooms dirty or infested with bugs.

A great feature for anyone staying with kids. The breakfest and happy hour were free as part of our package so how can you complain. I would recommend staying as part of a timeshare solicitation if you can since all room rates in Ka'anapali are high priced. We discoved the package deal on the Embassy Ka'anapali web site.

The Embassy's spot on the ocean is VERY nice - wasn't crowded, plenty of chairs for the beach and poolside. With the Cabanna rentals - you pay $30/day, but have your own private view of the ocean with adjustable cover for yourself and mate (or in our case 1 year old) made it really nice! Service was top. We had no problem getting help when needed. Laundry machines on each floor made it convenient to economize on amount of clothes brought.

I think they get a certain number of tickets at discount and when there tickets are gone they tell you they are sold out, so try on your own. We did the whale watching trip the resort recommended and it was great. I would recommend the Fest of Lele Laua it was expensive $100 per person but worth it, it is a small more intimate setting compared to the large group setting at a traditional lula were you sit a a large table with many people and stand in line for a buffet, here you sit at your own table and are served a 4 course meal right to your table.

The front desk staff was very unfriendly and the timeshare folks were snotty. The other rooms we had were not rennovated and were so run down it was comical. They were horrible - broken down furniture, the worst beds on the planet (the new beds are bad too) and stinky. My sister's room got overrun with chemical odor during the last night from construction on the floor above. Oh, beware of the construction!! They say it won't be that bad! Bull!

My husband and I loved the Embassy! I was a little concerned about going after I read some of the bad reviews prior to the trip. After seeing the hotel and experiencing it myself I am shocked at just how picky people are. We had a great time there. We stayed in a room on the 12th (top) floor. We had a deluxe ocean view suite. The view was gorgeous! We had a view of the ocean, Island of Lanai, the pool, and the countryside toward the mountains. We spent quite a bit of time on the balcony enjoying our view. The living room was great. I admit, the chairs and couch were not of the same pattern but did match in color and were quite comfortable. I can't believe anyone had actually complained about them. The kitchen was also a nice space with a good size fridge, dishwasher, microwave, & sink. We were a bit puzzled at first but the dishwasher since there was no stove to cook on but found that it was nice to not wash dishes on our honeymoon-even if we only had glasses, and lunch plates. The bedroom was spacious and well decorated. Bathroom had a shower stall, two sinks, toilet room, and whirpool bath. We enjoyed every aspect of it. We found the hotel to be quiet. We were right above the Ohana Bar area and were glad that the live music never went late and the bar closed by 10pm. The hotel staff was always curteous and friendly and always willing to help. We went to the guest services desk a few times for advice on trips and were always given excellent information. We were even steered clear of a trip that would have been a total waste. The coctail hour was great! There was live music and even a snack to go with drinks. The bartender certainly did not skimp on the alcohol. Breakfast buffet was good too. They had scrambeled eggs (every day), a meat selection (varied daily), Potatoes (varied daily), and either pancakes or french toast depending on the day. They had a daily fruit bar, cereal, and toast. I enjoyed it every day and found the varied items added the variety I needed but my husband wasnt fond of the scrambeled eggs. I must admit they were a bit runny on certain days but if you ask me its better than having dry flaky eggs. Like others, the birds were a bit annoying at times but it was nice to eat outdoors so we dealt with them. Food was always covered except for the fruit which was in a buffet stand but wasn't exactly wide open. I never saw any birds or bugs around it. We both enjoyed the pool area and I even went down the waterslide! Lounge chairs were plentiful in the sun and shade. We never had trouble finding a place to sit. The sunset torch lighting ceremony was cool. The person lighting torches was always dressed in costume and had no problem posing for photo after photo. The beach area was smaller than the ones I'm used to seeing in Florida and California but it was just the right size. We never felt crowded and found the area was always neat and clean! We had meals at both the North Beach & Ohana restaurants and loved the food at both. North beach was a bit more formal- wait staff friendly at both. My favorite meal was the Hawiian Pizza at Ohana! Traveling on the island is easy, there is one major highway and very few side streets. We traveled the north, west, and east sides. Be aware of road signs as some roads have 90 degree turns. Also note that there are few directional signs to tourist areas.

My husband and I just returned from Maui Embassy and needless to say the \"Vacation Ownership\" \"Mini Vacation\" deal was NO deal at all. After we checked into the hotel, we realized that we wanted a different room because of the mold growing on the caulking in the shower door along with the shower door tilled and almost to the brink of breaking off, and the noise of the freeway on the scenic view, and the lack of taste in the room of the mis-matched furniture that had scum stains all over the couch. As we trotted along, we spent one of our precious afternoons listening to a sales pitch regarding the \"vacation ownership\" program. When we told the sales rep. of our disatisfaction of the room, he admitted to us that the 10th floor has not been renovated and that room number 1032 is one of the worst rooms in the hotel, and that only the \"owners\" get the use of the delux and or the renovated rooms, however he continued to ask us if we were interested in buying into the vacation ownership. I laughed and said no. How can I buy something that I haven't even experienced the best of? (I'm glad that I didn't spend the full amount that any of the travel agencies were quoting me for this trip). Along with the room discrepencies, the employees of the hotel looked as if they were zombies. Their expression or non-expression said of us that we don't want to be here. The only group of people that ever said Aloha or hello were the janitors in the lobby and the maintence crew, oh and the hardest working person in the entire hotel would have to be the older man at the pool hut. All of the others just seemed stand around and chit-chat while he's busting his ---. Throughout the week, we asked several employees at the hotel, (front-desk, valet,etc.) where we can get \"plate lunch.\" Instead they would reply \"I'm not a food coniseour\", or direct us to the nearlest \"Deny's\" type of resturants. We didn't come all this way to have hambers and pancakes. Also the manager's cocktail reception consisted of drinks that were completely watered down served with some cheap, cheesey, chex mix type. There's also a drink police at the front of the reception area. The entire week, we felt like we were doing something wrong, you can't walk around the hotel with your free drink in your hand, but you can walk around the hotel if you pay for your drink at the pool bar. Lastly, the breakfast was fair. There is always some type of meat there, (bacon, sausage links, sausage paties, etc) along with french toast or pancakes, some sort of a fried potato dish and lastly runny scrambled eggs (that's probably not all eggs, it sure didn't taste like 100% eggs.) It's pretty simple there, cheap food, cheap alcohol, run-down hotel from the interior to the exterior, and unfriendly service. Like I mentioned, we had the best time when we walked down about 1/2 miles south of the hotel and went swimming by our selves with no one from the hotel telling us we can't do this and we can't do that.

The place is going downhill fast. I usually go here every year, and, by a great stroke of luck, never purchased the time-share. When Embassy decided to timeshare the resort almost 8 years ago, the hotel was great. Good service, fantastic breakfast buffet, and nice update rooms. Now there is no service (they no longer have servers at the pool to get you the high priced drinks), the buffet is horrible, and the rooms are in the condition of a 2 star hotel. I had a hard time getting a room this year, since they no longer book at the hotel, you must go through a broker. They said 8 years ago that they were only going to sell 1/2 the hotel in timeshare....well...now it's 100%. This will be the demise of this resort. Thank god I did not buy, but it's a shame that such a great resort fell into this situation. It use to be the best in Maui in my opinion. If you are an owner (you have my sympathy), here are some tips: you need to be at the pool by 8am to be able to get a lounge chair, otherwise forget it, and since there is virtually no beach, there are not many other options. If you want to have a seat at the afternoon cocktail reception- get there at 530pm, no later, again you will be standing because of no seats, and you can not bring the drink out from the area. If you want to have dinner at the hotel, arrive at the restaurant at 530pm when they open, they offer a discount then that is not too bad, ask for a table by the ocean, and sometimes you will see the whales jump as you dine...this is one goodpoint. Water pressure in the shower is a joke. Try to stay on a top floor--they have few elevators, and if you are at a bottom floor, the elevator car is always full when it opens..bring a snack you could be waiting a long time.

It gets very crowded especially around 9:00 am and it is hard to get a table. People tend to go to the pool early, put towels down for the best chairs and then they never show up. We noticed all the towels but never people. The cabanas were nice for the beach- $25 a day if you rent them for 3 days or more. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

First off I'd like to say my wife and I are Timeshare owners with RCI ,we put in for a exchange to Maui. We were very happy with the resort as should I say \"Megaresort\" because it was huge. Since we were there on a timeshare exchange we had to pay 85 dollars for the week for the Breakfast and 10 dollars a day to park in the parking garage. The reviews you've read about the small parking spaces are accurate little has been said that there is a bottom level and those spaces are a bit bigger. The parking spaces may be small but the room suites are just more like an apartment size,we were ecstatic to have that much space!!!! We had an Ocean view and and nice balcony,also they had cable with HBO but we mostly watched Channel 7 \"The visitors channel\" The room was great just one small complaint the shower head was attached to the ceiling and we did'nt care for that. The managers happy hour from 4 till 6 was alright with mixed snacks(chips and pretzels) ,the drinks were well drinks not top shelf stuff. We went through the Embassy time share presentation and the woman was nice to us and did not pressure us. She knew that we already owned one timeshare and we just said we did'nt need another one. All in All it was a great experience at the Embassy Suites ,we were there from May 13 through May 20,2004.

There was major construction happeding on 5 floors while we were there, including the one we were staying on. What bothered us the most was that the painters left shpping carts full of paint and other chemicals unattended in the hallways; the painters were always down the hall and around the corner from these carts. When I informed the manager he said that there was nothing wrong with this, and that it was the parents' responsiblility to watch their children. We stayed in a \"renovated\" room. This includes rusty door knobs, a badly yellowed porch light, banged up furniture, a couch with the stuffing literally coming out, chipped paint all over, stained doors, and brown grout in the corners of the bathroom. Don't get excited about the renovation if you're expecting a renovated room. The common areas and hallways are what's getting spruced up, even though the rooms BADLY NEED RENOVATING. They did put down new carpeting, and the bedspread and curtains were in good shape.Don't make the same mistake we made; if you're looking for a clean, well-maintaned ROOM, stay somewhere else.

The only negative aspect of the pool area is the limited number of lounges and chairs (make sure you put a towel down on a lounge in the morning). The beach is just a few feet from the pool. I have read some other reviews addressing the algae growing in the waters directly off the beach from the resort. It's true that there is SOME algae in the water, however it is minimal and not a cause for concern. I think the person who wrote that review has never set foot on a beach before. Oh well, getting back to the resort there is also a gym located directly by the pool. The gym is a little small for the size of the resort, however the equiptment is in good condition and there is both cardio and resistance machines.

We were fortunate enough to get an oceanfront room at the height of whale season and the \"show\" they put on was quite spectacular! It was very rare not to see a whale SOMEwhere while looking out into the ocean! Okay, about the resort......... The pluses were: 1) Spaciousness. The bathrooms have a large tub (built for two!) and a separate shower with two sinks on opposite sides of the very large room. The \"kitchen\", dining, and living area of the one bedroom unit is like one large room so you can interact with your travelmate(s) no matter what you are doing. 2) The pool area is just beautiful! The pool itself is quite large and there is a separate pool with a slide for the kiddies. There are waterfalls that you can actually sit under and the hottub is large and the water is just hot enough. There's also a volleyball net for groups who want to partake of that. 3) There's a morning breakfast and an evening cocktail hour (actually two hours....) that are usually included in the price. 4) The daily maid service was very thorough. 5) A very courteous staff from the valet attendants to the bellhops to the front desk. 6) The location. It's right on the beach and within minutes of the Maui nightlife. 7) The view. Spectacular! You can see the islands of Lanai and Molokai, watch sea turtles romp right off shore, and if you are lucky enough to go during whale watching season (January through April), you'll see them EVERYWHERE! 8) A beautiful lobby area. There is plush seating everywhere and pools of very colorful carp and the constant sound of falling water. Very relaxing! 9) Cable TV with LOTS of channels for those who just wanna couch potato it for a while. 10) A beautiful sandy beach for romantic strolls and a coral \"reef\" for really great snorkeling just feet from the shore. 11) There's an 18 hole miniature golf course on property. 12) Towels, snorkel gear and special equipment are available from a poolside stand and nothing at all was EVER \"hawked\" to me (as someone else previously posted) the entire time I was there. 13) An evening lighting of the torches \"ceremony\" while a shellhorn signals the end of another day in paradise. Now the minuses: 1) Having stayed at several Embassy Suites, I was a little disappointed in the lack of variety at breakfast and the hors d'oeuvres during the cocktail hour. 2) There's no cooktop in the \"kitchen\", only a microwave, coffeemaker, toaster and mini-fridge. (this isn't really a minus to me since, I don't go on vacation to cook.........but some people like the ability to do so while staying in a condo and might be a little disappointed to find out that you can't unless you are in a two bedroom unit.....) 3) The balconies (\"lanais\") are rather narrow. A chair just barely fits from wall to railing. Overall, it was a very pleasant, relaxing vacation. On previous Maui trips I've stayed in Kahana, Kehei and Wailea and now I know why Kaanapali is so highly touted.........it definitely has the most to offer of any of the places I have stayed there.

Daily maid service in our suite was excellent. Grounds, landscaping, and multiple goldfish ponds were well-manicured and colorful. When we arrived in our suite, we were greeted with a bottle of champagne on the table with a personal note from the staff greeting and congratulating us on our special day. We reserved the honeymoon package which included complimentary daily breakfast buffet and afternoon cocktails.
