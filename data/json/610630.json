Cleanliness is not so great. The room service (changing of towels and claning of the floors) is horrible. If you ask for clean towels daily, Gloria gives you an \"are you serious\" attitude and has twice informed me that they \"do no change out towels everyday\". The vac is only run once a week and it was a big deal when I wanted my sheets changed after being in this room 10 days. I have yet to see them mop the kitchen and bathroom floors which today turned a brand new white pair of socks black in less than 5 minuets. The sheets that they say are clean not only feel dirty, they do not have a fresh smell to them and the comforters have not been washed in a very long time. I have twice now informed Gloria that my air conditioner is freezing only to be told it was brand new last summer and to stop opening my door. I am hardly ever here and the a/c is freezing over at night when set at 75. I was told tonight that there is a brand new one to be installed but not told when. Needless to say, its about 80 degrees outside and easily 90 in the room that has NO screens to be able to keep the windows open. There is supposed to be free wifi yet 5 different cell phones on 2 dfferent carriers can't pick up the wifi and neither can a fairly new laptop. There are NO landlines in these rooms so if you don't have a cell phone you better hope you don't have an emergency. When I came into the kitchen and saw no dishes or pots and pans, I asked about this and was told by Gloria they were not supplied. Guess you better pack the camping gear or plan to buy things to cook and eat with. Over all, this place is a dump. I will be talking to Mary tomorow and looking for another place to stay if conditions do not improve drastically as of tomorrow.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cdont waste your money\u201d", "Author": "Pghnumber1", "ReviewID": "UR124832473", "Content": "The lady at the front desk treats you as if shes doing you a favor letting you stay.

She allows my family and I to park our truck trailor and motorcycles in the back so that ppl will not destroy or steal or property, whether or not they are staying at the motel w/us.
