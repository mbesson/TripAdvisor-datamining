The wall paper was peeling everywhere. Third, the room was just terrible!! The carpet was not fitted, so it got rucked up when the suitcases were wheeled over it. The beds were terribly uncomfortable. The worst aspect by far was the lack of air conditioning. Our room was like a sauna. I ended up with a terrible heat rash from just staying in that room. About 5 or 6 times in the middle of the night I would have to get up to go to the bathroom to soak myself in water, and I mean SOAK! This and the window open was the only way I could fall asleep, even if it was just for an hour before I dried off and had to go through the process again. The clothes I wore in the room were completely soaked through with sweat. It was beyond awful!! To make matters worse, the water in the shower did not stay at any one temperature, so it was impossible to get cool by taking a cold shower. Sometimes it would be nice and cool, and then all of a sudden the water would change and it felt like it was burning me. Terrible!!

Hotel good points; Warm and welcoming A1 service at both reception and in the breakfast room - at 11pm the night manager came up to fix our shower literally 2 minutes after I had complained that we couldn`t get it to work. Large light room and bathroom. Spotlessly clean. Comfortable firm beds. Very reasonable rates. Right next to South Kensington tube station. Perfect situation for the Royal Albert Hall, the Natural History Museum and the V&A Museum. Plenty of reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance. Kensington is far more pleasant than staying in central London. Hotel poorer points: Most areas need recarpetting Some areas need decorating The furniture is shabby and the bathrooms are old. Apart from breakfast, there are no meals available at the hotel, but this is not really necessary because of the abundance of eateries outside. After 3 nights my overall impression was of the hotel as a lovely old lady who needs a substantial amount of money spending on her to make her watertight (!) and fashionable.

We booked a standard double room for \u00c2\u00a3100 per night and this turned out to be smaller than a Travel Lodge Room, the decor of the room and hotel in general was very poor indeed (carpets fraying and not fixed down in places) We had a room on the 1st floor where the window looked onto the the buildings next door, but insisted they moved us after we found a rat running around in the room last night!!. So they moved us to a room overlooking the front of the hotel, which was smaller (if this was possible) and did not have proper double glazing - so it was noisy. The staff did not care that there was a rat in our room and offered no apology, room upgrade or discount for this issue but just said that they would get maintenance to look at this in the morning. (which i doubt they did) The rat ran under the gap at the bottom of the room door, when we discovered it, and probably into another room. The only positives i can offer are that the location is really good for going out seeing the sights as the tube station and museums are really close. I would suggest that you make arrangements for your evening entertainment (there is only a breakfast room so you will have to eat out for the evening) so that you are either too tired or slightly drunk to care about the rooms when you return. Also there is no room service so get a night cap or hot drink to take back with you from one of the cafe bars nearby.

I loaded my plate with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, toast and orange juice. That carried me through to dinner. The room was bigger than I expected for the money. The bathroom was nice. The bed comfortable, the staff friendly and competent. There's a computer in the lobby with free Internet access. If that's not enough, there's an Internet cafe straight across the street.

I would think they should know how booked they are weeks in advance, let alone one night... And we were thrown on the fifth floor!!!!! We are on the top of the building and they have a strange - should I call it heater for water???? It is a heater located in the bathroom, it is hot like in winter, I guess it serves to keep the water hot??? Just imagine that hot thing working 24 hours in a room already hot. For $147/night I could have gotten a room in a Central 3 stars Hotel with no AC, but I chose to pay $200 a NIGHT TO STAY IN THIS HOTEL and they actually dont have the advertised AC. Our stay in London is a mess just knowing I come to a hot room. Please stop advertising AC in your hotel!!!!!!! Let people know that only some rooms have it!!!

I travelled here with a friend and we spent 6 nights at this hotel - after one night in a really disgusting hotel in London and 5 nights in a so-so hotel in Paris, I was really optimistic about this hotel because we paid almost double for this room than we had paid for the other hotels that we had stayed in during the previous week. I was still optimistic when walked into the lobby - the lobby is fairly nice and the bar attached to the lobby looked clean. We checked in, received our room key and that's when it all went downhill. First, I got into the elevator, which bounces at least ten times when it stops at your floor. The elevator finally opened at the 4th floor - the floor smelled, the carpet was worn and stained, and to top it all off, the desk staff checked us into an occupied room. I opened the door to find a dirty room, unmade beds and a large pair of men's underwear lying in the unmade bed. After we finally got into another room, we opened the door to a large stain on the carpet - which we can only decribe as something the looked like a vomit stain. We had basically no water in the bathroom. If you want to shower at this hotel, shower at 10 PM, because there is not enough hot water to go around in the morning. The bedspreads on the bed were filthy and torn. I can only describe the blankets as nappy and disgusting. The desk lamp did not work. The pillows sucked. The temperature in the room was unbearably hot. The matresses were stained and just downright gross. The beds are uncomfortable. The so-so hotel that we stayed at in Paris the week before was a palace compared to this room. For the price that we paid for this hotel, I thought it would actually be clean and new.

I turned up with a booking confirmation and reference number only to be told that there was no record of it on the system, they were full, and there was no room available for me. There was nothing they could do for me as there was 'No reservation on their system' (remember that bit its important!) Anyway, they receptionist then said I could actually get a FOC taxi over to their sister hotel the Henry VIII in Bayswater (a familiar story if you read the other reviews) as they had availability. As I had travelled all the way from Nottingham that morning, to Olympia, worked all day until 10pm then travelled to the Hotel without having eaten, the last thing I wanted was to travel again across London, and besides it was not suitable as I needed to be in the Kensington area. I told the receptionist that this was not acceptable, that I did not want to go to another hotel and that if there was no reservation, I would have to go elsewhere. She then kindly (hmm) helped me find a telephone number for the Jury's Kensington Hotel, which I had stayed at before, and witnessed me book a room there. Once this was done, I asked the receptionist how, to go about claiming back a refund for our deposit - she told me she could not help me with this, but I was best to contact the reservation company. With this I set off on my not so merry way for a brief walk to the trusty Jury's Kensington, and had a great nights sleep!! The End.... or so we thought... I turns out a month later that the Henry VIII had charged us for a 'non-show' for the night at their hotel. A non show for a room we had not reserved - at a hotel I did not want to stay at!! How does that work ? - well apparently as there was no room at the Grosvenor Hotel I automatically had a reservation made at the Henry VIII Hotel, who had in turn taken the credit card details from the Grosvenor for the reservation, then charged us for this non-show as we did not cancel the reservation that 'did not exist on their system'... fantastic!! If you think about it its very clever - they book you into a Kensington hotel and they suddenly have no rooms available, and have to ship you off to another area of London - one which you probably would not have thought about staying in. In fact thinking back, I now remember the bloke before me a the check in desk being told to wait for a taxi to the Henry VIII. At the time I just thought he could not get a room, but they had been nice and sorted him out! My advice, don't book here - they are incompetent.

We decided to grin and bear it (actually we didn't have any choice because the desk attendant said they were booked solid for the ENTIRE WEEK we were staying and that no other rooms were available. I think I may have offended him by suggesting he see what couples looked like they weren't getting along at check in and shaft them with our room. He declined). Most of the desk staff was rude or indifferent. A word of warning getting to your room - take the stairs. The elevator is so scary I though it was broken. It wasn't!! As is arrived at the appropriate floor, it bounced up and down at least ten times (we counted). Our room had two lovely windows (see, I can say something nice!). Unfortunately, one was glued shut and the other opened to reveal a school full of screaming children directly below. I have always heard that the sound of children at play is lovely, but I have to assume that maybe that reference is to less children. I did not find the screaming pack of banshees relaxing or any other pleasant word. It seemed like recess was an all day affair. I thought maybe a relaxing shower was the cure for a 10 hour flight. This was not in the cards. I suggest anyone staying here physically train for the showers before you come. Jump in and out at high speeds while dripping wet, practice the \"grab and shove\" (grabbing the shower curtian and shoving it in front of the object that is forcefully driving scalding water at you) and showering with gloves on (all the fixtures are too hot to touch). The shower dance deserves its own review, however, I will just say that I had daily panic attacks at the thought of my 83 year old grandmother (who was staying down the hall) attempting to shower. The hotel is located very close to the tube station and some fantastic museums. I think the neighborhood is hard to beat.

But in the spirit of fairness I decided to read all the reviews already posted before launching into my tirade of vitriol and bile. It seems that some people have loved this hotel (!!) and others have hated it, how can this be? Were my expectations too high to begin with? For context I have stayed in many hotels across the whole range including Claridges, city breaks, country hotels, Travel Lodges, some B&Bs and also been on several \u00c2\u00a39.50 Sun Holidays and I can say without doubt that this is easily the worst hotel experience so far. At best the hotel could be described as tired and in need of a spruce up, in reality it was shabby and in need of a complete refurb. However when entering the lobby it looks quite impressive (this unsurprisingly is also the photo they use on their website) but once you leave this lobby area the true character of the hotel reveals itself. It starts with the juddery lift and then the threadbare carpet in the hallways leading to Room 215 where despite having booked a double room I found myself in what was obviously a twin where the two beds had been pushed together. The headboards are attached to the wall and so when the beds were pushed together there was only a headboard one side. There were 4 pillows available but one was so small and thin that to call it a pillow is an insult. Clothes were quickly unpacked and put away into the plywood construction wardrobe with 2 sets of built in shelves for non hanging items \u00e2\u20ac\u201c how much does it cost to supply a chest of drawers!! I then attempted to put away my wash stuff in the bathroom where the only space to put anything was a small shelf the size of two tiles in front of the mirror. There were two sachets of shampoo and 2 tiny bars of soap left on this shelf compliments of the hotel! The room itself was shabby and in need of attention, the window pane in one of the windows had been puttied into place with the skill of a 3 year old (no offence to any 3 year olds reading this). The bedside cabinet had a huge hole in the side of it, there were exposed wires on the telephone. There was a tv in the room and unlike some of the other reviewers I was lucky enough to have a working remote. I then heard a loud bell and initially fearing the worst that there was a fire I found that the school the other side o the road had just finished and the bell signalled 200 screaming children out into the playground. Relief quickly set in that this was a Friday and that we would not be disturbed by the school run the following morning. We decided to shower and change before heading off into Oxford St, it was then we discovered a very powerful shower which unfortunately fluctuated between hot and cold at its own whim. On leaving the hotel its one good feature was revealed - it is only a few hundred yards to the Tube Station. After our evening out, we returned to the hotel at 10.30 and entered the Norfolk Bar, having just eaten my partner asked for a coffee, to be told that they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do coffee. At 11.00 sharp with no warning the shutters came down in the bar and there was an attempt to usher us into the lounge, which is a room just off reception with a couple of sofas in it. We decided to return to our room, the telephone had a label informing me that Room Service was on extension 700 which I dialled to get no answer, so I dialled down to reception to be told that there was no room service. In a mixture of surprise, horror, shock, hysterics and amazement we read the information pages on the tv and I quote information page 160 stated that beverages were available 24 hours a day. My partner then rang back to reception and explained that we wanted some drinks, she was told rather abruptly that there was no room service, when she quoted the TV information she was calmly told that the TV was wrong!! After 10 mins of arguing and being told that there was no duty manager available we managed to persuade the hotel to let us have some ice and some tonic water, but this had to be fetched from reception ourselves. We were given a glass of ice and one small bottle of tonic. Luckily we decided against a cup of tea before going to bed as they were only 2 tea bags and we felt we dare not impose on the hotel staff for tea bags as well as tonic water. The room was very noisy over night with traffic and refuse collection and general noise but luckily the school did not open the following morning. I cannot comment on the breakfast as we decided against it but given the rest of our experience Im sure it would have been lovely !!!! We checked out next morning \u00e2\u20ac\u201c apparently there was no manager available for us to talk to \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we paid the \u00c2\u00a31.50 we were charged for the tonic water, We did make use of the luggage storage facility for the day which was an unlocked room open to anyone with a large sign warning us that we left our cases at our own risk.

On the first morning the fire alarm went off at 6-30 in the morning...it was ignored by staff - luckily there was no fire. The shower had no thermostatic control so it alternated between scalding and freezing- no amount of adjusting taps made any difference. Breakfast was indifferent and unimaginative but similar to many such places. The room i occupied - 518 had ripped carpets held together by tape, the base of the bed had been ripped, the material just hanging but it was comfortable enough. Second night we had sorted out the second room but we had a small amount of stress on returning to the hotel as the receptionist had lost the reservation on the computer but it was sorted out. The second room my colleague had was in much better shape- in fact ok except where they had put the shower meant you had to crouch as it was in the corner of a sloping roof. Only stay there if you have too!", "Date": "May 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cSUPER HOTEL!!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5035160", "Content": "i think all the people that want to go to this hotel or already booked it, made the right decision. when i read the reviews i was really scared actually, i mean if there are grease marks on your pillow and mould everywhere you get quite frightened. But i came there with very low expectations, and it was WONDERFUL! the service was brilliant, friendly, quick and very helpfull! the room was really big with great big soft beds. ( we had a triple room 2 c, 1 a) so there was a bunkbed, and one queensize bed. it was really quiet not a sound at all! the shower was perfect, the bathroom too, except for one or two small cracks in the tiles. we had a big closet, a coffee and tea maker, a big tv screen etc. everything was excactly what it said it would be. and most important it was very clean!!! also the gym and spa are free, very very nice, the gym equipment is very modern! and you get a breakdast buffet, really nice!!! so it is a bargain , and i don't know what the people who wrote the other bad reviews are used to, maybe the deluxe hilton, ofcourse this hotel is a bit old, but it is really cosy! and second of all, people who had a bad experience only write a review, the ones who did had a hell of a time don't!! so really no need for worrying, and if you want to be sure of a good room, just ask for room 204 ( 1 queen, 1 bunk) bye!", "Date": "May 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leeds, UK", "Title": "\u201cNice, Friendly Hotel\u201d", "Author": "murray71", "ReviewID": "UR4724078", "Content": "I stayed in this hotel for one night last weekend.

I needn't have worried. The staff were friendly and welcoming, the room very large and comfortable and the breakfast ok!

You will think you are getting a bargin - but don't be tempted! The room was mouldy, the central heating did not work, the mattress was stained and brown, and the shower squirted out at all angles, flooding the bathroom and almost causing an accident on the water soaked floor! they could not move us that night. in the morning they said we could leave our luggage downstairs and come back later for a standard room that would be vacated. We wanted a shower! To be fair, they then moved us to an 'executive' room. This was ok, nice big victorian room, warm with a big bed. However, the loo seat was broken, and the shower only got to luke warm at best. On our last night the TV blew up and all the electric appliances stopped working. We did make it to breakfast, be warned. We work in a prison and noticed that some of the suppliers used by the hotel must be the same. All we can say is do not eat the margarine! Even our 'guests' wont eat it! Stay at this hotel at your peril.

I chose it because of its location across the road from South Kensington tube and the fact it was walking distance from the museums and Kensington Palace. My partner and I arrived at the hotel around 11am. I had taken with us the print out of our booking confirmation which was a good thing as to start with they couldn't find my booking. But the lady on reception was very helpful and apologetic and after a quick phone call my booking was sorted. So only had to wait about 10 minutes. She explained the room wouldn't be ready until 2pm as that was check in time but we were aware of that anyway. So we left our luggage in the left luggage room which was kept unlocked so anyone could go in there. But I had used a combination lock on the suitcase after reading the reviews about this facility! We decided to go to Kensington Palace first and this was probably about a 20 minute walk. After visiting here we were able to check into our room, so we had a freshen up bath before going out for the evening. We weren't expecting a spa bath so although a little disappointed when that part didn't work we didn't make a big fuss as we hadn't asked for it. The room itself was clean, roomy and perfect for the one night we were staying. However the labels on everything are still Moat House ones so that needs to be changed. We ran out of tea and coffee as the supply hadn't been topped up but the night receptionist soon got those for us. Had no problems with the shower the next morning. Like a previous poster, the tea was cold by the time we got down to breakfast but a fresh pot was soon made for us. The continental buffet breakfast was more than sufficient we found. As we weren't leaving London until later that day we were able to leave our luggage again after checking out. This time it was a day that the concierge was in, so we had to sign for our luggage to be left. Overall this hotel was not as bad as expected and I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "January 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cNeeds a Refurb!!!

I booked this hotel off the internet where it said it was 4* and that 'recently refurbished rooms offer all the comforts of fine living'. Turning up at the hotel which is in a great location for central London I was looking forward to my 'recently refurbished' room. On arrival I was allocated a room which was tatty, grubby, did not have proper bedding and had not seen a lick of paint for years. It was so bad I never even went into the bathroom. My wife went hot foot down to reception (now my wife is not one for compaining - she usually leaves that to me - so this shows how bad it was) and complained that this was not a 4* hotel and we refused to take the room. After discussion with reception and the manager we were give a crown room which also had not been refurbished curtains but was not quite bad enough to compain about. If the bathroon had been in a house it is the sort of thing that an estate agent would have described as 'in need of morenisation'. It was not clear from what the staff said as to whether some of the hotel had been refurbished or that the refurbishment was still to start - but I did not get the impression that we were the first to complain. They certainly knew the web site was wrong and blamed the new company which had bought it. Places like this give the star rating system a bad name. Go elsewhere.
