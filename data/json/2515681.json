I booked the Palomar San Diego without knowing much about the hotel. I can say with certainty that it was an absolutely amazing experience -- one of the best we have ever had. The hotel is beautiful -- the decor is hip, and the rooms are massive. What really stood out to me, however, was the service. We were greeted by Johnson Menezes at the front desk. From the moment we met him, he ensured that every element of our stay was taken care of. From helping us get reservations at the perfect place for dinner, or setting us up with an absolutely amazing room with a view, Johnson really looked out for us.

Now.\u201d", "Author": "HoldenCal", "ReviewID": "UR128988362", "Content": "My wife and I travelled from Calgary, Alberta to San Diego and searched online for a hotel and ended up booking the Kimpton Palomar. Man, we were not disappointed. When you travel to a new city, it's kind of a crap shoot to find a hotel based on pictures and reviews, because they are always mixed. Well, I can tell you this place won't disappoint. From the minute we pulled up to the valet, we were greeted by Chuy, and our experience was first rate from there. My wife and I are early to mid thirties (for reference), and we were blown away at how great this hotel was. From the modern design, beautiful hardwoods, and modern rooms, I would liken this hotel to staying at a friends house that is that new, modern style. We felt comfortable from the moment we entered the massive front door till we pulled away to head home. The staff are outstanding, very friendly and extremely helpful. Location is prime for San Diego, close to restaurants, music, the water, and even a few steps from drugstores, coffee shops, etc. As a bit of a techie, I always hope for lots of plugs to keep my iPhones, iPads and cameras fully charged and this hotel was great for that. The tv system is LodgeNet, so you can even control it from your iPhone/iPad using the LodgeNet app. The bed - Holy moses, this is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. You usually return from vacation and look forward to getting back to your own bed. Not this time. I think of that king size bed every night. And the pillows are just as comfortable. Bathroom - Travelling with my wife, occasionally we find bathrooms a little cramped for space but not at the Palomar. Tonnes of room, great stand up shower. Cleanliness - Our room looked just like the professional photos. Other - My wife and I were preparing for a night out and were standing outside the main door deciding where to go, when a crazy person started swinging her purse at people. The staff response was swift, and they restored calm for the patrons of the hotel. They are simply outstanding. Our main experience was with Chuy, and man, that guy is possibly one of the best I have ever met. Friendly, helpful, and informative. The three things you look for in hotel staff. From suggestions of places to see and things to do, Chuy made our stay first class. (See you next time dude). The pool - Man, what a great pool area. The seating and bar area are amazing, best in class. Must See - Go to Coronado.. great little day trip, and boardwalk area. If you are a nerd like us and have watched the OC, Laguna Beach, etc... it is a short drive north along the coast. La Jolla - Don't even think about it... just go there. It's beautiful. There are only two complaints... 1) The weather in San Diego was foggy for the entire weekend we were there. Kimpton, you make everything else beautiful, so please work on the weather. 2) The Pool area and Bar... not really a complaint, but it's only open til 8 pm. We like a lot of other travellers go out and explore all day, and we would have really loved to have the bar and pool area open till 10, 12 pm? It's a shame to have such a great area and it's closed every time you get back for the day... not really a complaint, but just a suggestion. Even 10 pm would be great. Thanks again Kimpton, we will be back...", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Playa del Rey, California, United States", "Title": "\u201cExcellent weekend escape\u201d", "Author": "Cynthia S", "ReviewID": "UR128662207", "Content": "We stayed at the Palomar on Saturday April 21st. I had been to several Kimpton Hotels in San Francisco and was excited to see what this one would be like since each one seems to have its own unique personality! I wasn't disappointed. From our first minute there, we had a great experience. Chuy at the door was extremely helpful. I had made a reservation for a special deal online and expected a nice room but had no idea what we were in store for! We stayed in a King room that had to be 600-700 sq feet. Everything was modern but comfy and the bed was extremely sleepworthy :) I loved the robes and the fact that the hotel provided plenty of towels so we didn't need to call for extras which we usually do. Everything was clean and the staff were very attentive, especially the manager, Johnson. The hotel is walking distance from everything so we didn't need to drive when we went our to meet friends in the Gaslamp district. The only downside which is not the hotel's fault is that if you self park your car you have to go three blocks away, but that seemed like only a minor hassle since one we were there we didn't need to go anywhere.

From the reviews and pictures I'd seen of Hotel Palomar I was excited to stay here during my three day weekend for a friend's wedding in San Diego. I may have had too high of expectations going into it, but at $300/night I didn't think it was unrealistic. The location of the hotel is great in relation to the gas lamp district, restaurants, bars, etc. The room was a bit small, but nice, loved the hardwood floors, and the bathroom/shower were fantastic. The best part of the hotel were the doormen, hands down. They were always helpful, chill, conversational, and good guys. With that being said, I do not think I will be returning to the Hotel Palomar for multiple reasons. During breakfast both mornings we were having to swat at the fruit flies constantly. There was not an abundance of them, but it seemed there was one circling the table and our food at all times. If you are looking to relax at the pool, get some sun, and have a few drinks....this may not be the place for you. The pool is located on the north side of the building, which means the sun is blocked from the entire pool area until about 1:30 in the afternoon. The pool bar was supposed to be open at noon, but the bartender did not arrive until 12:15 and took 45 minutes to set up the bar area. The upkeep on the wood and rusted metal for the furniture of the cabanas and beds near the bar is highly lacking. The planters in the wood behind the couch/beds near the bar are trashy, filled with junk, mixed dirt & rocks, and really should either be filled in with sand or rock.....or actually have plants in there to hide the trashy look. However, the individual whipping up the cold menu at the pool was awesome and his food was great. I would not say that it was a bad stay by any means, but I was not impressed to the point of wanting to return. Obviously the location of the pool relative to the position of the sun is not something that anyone can help, but the attention to detail and upkeep would go a long way in elevating this hotel to the standards I believe they attempt to be held in.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cBrown, brown and brown\u201d", "Author": "psjofors", "ReviewID": "UR128366686", "Content": "If you like brown, this is the place for you.

The location is pretty good, right downtown and walking distance to lots of restaurants and the shopping centre. The rooms are smallish, which is to be expected for the location. We arrived early and were able to check in right away, which was appreciated. We were \"upgraded\" to a room with a balcony - I wouldn't pay extra for this, as the balcony is tiny (no room for a chair) and there is no view to speak of. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable, if a little soft. The bathroom has just a sliding door on it, there is no separate door for the toilet area, and the shower has just a half glass wall, so you'd better be comfortable with your travelling partner. The shelf in the shower is slanted, presumably so water doesn't pool on it, but the unfortunate consequence is that toiletries have a tendancy to slide right off the shelf and onto the shower floor. There is no tub, which was fine for us but may be an issue for others. There is no carpeting in the rooms as it is all hardwood - fine for us, but those travelling with children may have an issue with this. Parking is $36 valet, and there is no self-parking on the site, though this is fairly standard for an older building in the downtown area. The valet staff were very prompt and friendly. The hotel offers free wi-fi. There are no ice machines available, but the front desk staff will happily provide ice on request. There are also no water/pop machines on the floors, but there is a drug store across the street from the hotel. All the staff we encountered from the front desk to the valet to housekeeping were pleasant and helpful.

They retrieved my car once for me when I forgot one of my bags and coat. The parking is not on site; so I appreciate the extra effort. Check-in was a breeze, friendly while efficient. The room while modern is sparse with high ceilings and wood floors. Minimal decor, small television for those who wish to watch some tv to relax. The beds are comfortable, I found the pillows to be on the hard side. The bathroom is modern but you will have to fuss with the knob for the shower to get them temperature right. It is not an easy one way hot, the other way cold or progressive hot to cold. The mini bar is expensive (the usual) but I did not find any vending machines. No ice bucket for the room. BYOB of soda or what not for the small fridge! You can hear the hummm of city traffic below; I turned on the AC fan and it seemed to help drown out some of the noise. My room was on the 9th floor.

She has one too many accessories on, a bit too much eyeliner, and you know by the end of the night she's going to be DYING to take off those stilettos. Solamar is more like your super cool friend who is always going on fun adventures and wants to take you with. Palomar has upscale styling, but it ends up looking like the upscale styling of every other upscale hotel. Solamar has a fresher approach to design, including very funky mirrors in the guest rooms. To me, Solamar feels effortless, approachable, and soothing. Palomar is very nice, but just not my speed. Note 1: The pool wasn't open while I was there (or at least I couldn't find a way to unlock the door to it). That was a bummer, because I love going out on Solamar's pool deck in the early morning and curling up with a good book as the sun climbs. Note 2: The guest rooms have fab wooden floors, which help alleviate my bed bug paranoia, but their heavy wood beds scratch the floors to pieces. Note 3: I do LOVE Palomar's rolling ottomans. I rolled back and forth all over the room in a frenzy just for fun. They roll REALLY quickly and the rooms have somewhat of a corridor inside that's a perfect rolling tract. I think a lot of travelers will prefer Palomar over Solamar, but if you're a more laid back beachier type of person with an eye for funkier design I suggest trying Solamar.

It was a beautiful weather, as always in SoCal, so a walk to the Marina Park was a perfect way to stretch the legs (great recommendation by the staff). At check out, the front desk staff was tied up, so the Concierage jump right in, checked me out quickly and made sure that my bill was emailed to me for my records (received before I got to the airport).

( I stay in about 10 hotels a month ) but after reading \"The Vegas Show Guy's \" inaccurate review of The Palomar, I had to give my two cents! First some History on my stays- I originally found this place through a Hotwire purchase. It was \"Hotel Se\" at the time. I got in late and expected the typical treatment of how most hotels tend to treat Hotwire/Priceline guests ( Hotels tend to give those customers the least desirable rooms, by elevators, small or whatever ) well I was met by the Concierge and this night, he upgraded me to the most amazing room I have stayed in, in a long time. I was just your average guest, nothing special. When I left I felt like I had stayed at the Ritz and was addicted to this hotel. Upon my next visit, I learned the hotel had changed to a Kimpton property, my friendly Concierge had moved on, but I was met by a beaming front desk clerk named Nicole. Needless to say, Palomar had retained its great service in the transition. The restaurant was closed for renovation on this visit but I was excited to see it was going to be a upscale yet casual place that I would look forward to on my next visit. 3rd visit- ( Now a Palomar addict ) Nicole once again was at the desk, and this time Johnson came out to greet me and introduced himself as the Assistant Office ( front desk ) manager. He gave me his card and said if I needed anything to please contact him. Once again a PERFECT experience. ( Oh and this time the new addition to the staff was Kona the Goldfish! He does exist ) The Valet's at the Palomar are amazing- One night I got in late and had forgotten to remove my do not disturb sign on my room so housekeeping did not clean my room. I let him know at 10pm and he took care of it! By the time I was done with dinner and back in my room it was clean. And yes it is TRUE that the Valet gives you a card upon arrival with your car and lets you know to text when you need the car. It works and I loved the convenience! They are very clear about this policy so I do not know why Vegas guy would write that. Now let's talk about the SALTBOX- Love Love Love Erin! Full of life and a bevy of information. She makes one mean Martini! All of the staff in the bar have been amazing and as a Biz traveler I usually like to go somewhere other then the hotel to eat. Especially in the Gas Lamp. But you know what? I would not go anywhere else. The Sliders? - YUM, my favorite? The Lemon/Butter popcorn! ( Seriously ) Unfortunately I will not always be able to afford the Palomar, ( Our company has $$ Limitations ) but when I can, I will pick this first. It will be easy for some of you to think I work for this property, I assure you I do not. Feel free to contact me with your comments if you like. Hope all of you who get the chance to go to this property, enjoy it as much as I do. ( If you can afford it, you MUST book the Suites with the balcony and kitchen. You WILL NOT be disappointed! ( Final Note- This is kind of a hip trendy place. I am not sure it is the type of place that would appeal to the Senior set. If you are a Marriott Courtyard kind of person, or need a beach resort type place, this may not be for you! But if you like a lively nightlife, beautiful city views and GREAT GREAT SERVICE then you will be right at home at Palomar!)", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester,MA", "Title": "\u201cExcellence in the Gaslamp District !\u201d", "Author": "seabit", "ReviewID": "UR122618305", "Content": "The Palomar San Diego is in the Gaslamp District of downtown, and what a treat to be so close to so many of San Diego's attractions !

E.g. Comments that guests asked for a fish, Kona, in their room ( dont seem that mentioned anywhere on site or by staff). Reviews mention texting valet to get car. Again, we were never advised of such conveniences. Unfortunately our experiences were negative aside from the Saltbox restaurant ( in separate review), which we enjoyed immensely. Just stayed in 2 rooms for 3 nights ( 1 senior, 3 adults, 2 kids = 6 people ). Booked it through Expedia on their \"unpublished hotel\" facility. Not a good idea. For us at least. This is the old Hotwire Co they acquired. You choose a general area and grade of hotel, pay upfront and then get advised of hotel you will stay at. So, we chose downtown san diego, 4.5 star. What could go wrong with a 4.5 star hotel in San Diego? For approx $170 p.night p.room with taxes. Not the cheapest, but, wow it was going to be 4.5 star. Then the fun started... We were advised via email that the hotel was the kimpton in gaslamp quarter. Having lived in San Francisco and stayed at kimptons there, we were happy as they have a good reputation there. As a safeguard, Immediately after I booked with expedia, I called the property directly to request that the rooms we purchased have 2 beds each as we were a party of 6. Hotel advised that they do not allow any requests for bookings coming from expedia/hotwire as the room rate they get is so low that we get \"run of house\" or whats left basically and that the room rate was less than an employee rate. ( not my problem - sorry - kimptons business decision ). So from the get go, it felt like were second rate citizens. It turns out that Kimpton only acquired this property, formerly Ce ce) approx 3 months ago and was desperately trying to fill rooms at any cost and ignoring the star rating. So, I asked was the hotel full or what the likelihood of getting rooms with 2 beds would be. They said they had 3 rooms with 2 beds left and that to guarantee we get them, we could upgrade for $20 per room per night. I was reluctant as I now felt like I'd been taken. I asked how they expected 6 people to sleep in 2 beds. Answer: the rooms are fire coded for 4 people irrespective of number of beds. Not the answer I was looking for. The conversation was clearly going nowhere. Not 4.5 star service. No other suggestions. I said I'd call expedia and get back. Called expedia. Spoke with phillipino person who spent forever looking up \"terms of conditions\" of my purchase. Said she would refer to supervisor. Got cut off. I called back. Spoke to another agent, who said the notes in the booking said, \" no guarantees of bed arrangement and that was it '. I then suggested they call hotel to request rooms with 2 beds on our behalf as they should have more \"clout\" or to change us to another 4.5 star hotel in the San Diego area. They used the standard, empathize and restate guidelines and said, \" I'm sorry sir, I do understand sir, but we cannot call hotel and we cannot change the hotel\". I stated that I could call my credit card company and cancel the transaction for misrepresentation, then, I would be happy to book with expedia again in a property that would guarantee 2 beds in each room ( not too much to ask is it? ). I was told I couldn't do that per their terms. Solution came when a manager got on the line and advised to go ahead and pay the upgrade to hotel and fax receipt to expedia for a refund. I haven't done that yet. The property its self seems like its in flux. Several different staff inconsistences. I felt sorry for the front desk girls. There is a need for consistent training. Eg. Called hotel phone. \"Do you have towels we can take to beach?\" . \"Yes you can take the green towels from the pool\". Went to pool. No staff. No towels. went to front desk. \"Where are beach towels please\"?. Answer. \"Sorry you cant take towels to beach\". \"Oh, I just spoke with housekeeping on phone and they advise it was ok. I went to pool and couldnt see anybody or any towels. None on view anywhere.\". \"Oh, ok, that was probably the manager who was trying to be nice and helpful\". gal said. \". \"Great, so where are they?\". There are purple towels at the back around the corner of the pool\". I went. Low and behold. WHITE TOWELS (just like ones in room). Oy Vey. This was to get a towels. No fridges. (Locked minibars only). Nice wood panel floors, but heavy , deep, scratches by side table and bed. No coffee makers. Weak chocolate and coffee in lobby in am. Parking is valet only. $36 per day. (thats pricey). Valet guy was helpful with directions. No real views to speak of. Parking garage (rm 604). Back of house, vents, etc(rm901). Errors on bill. Got charged for 2 cars, 3 nights. Only used valet 1 night with 1 car. Bed sheets were clean and comfy, however, beds were small ( double beds ). ok for 1 person only. Rooms somewhat clean. \"Dust/Fluff bunnies\" in room on floor. Shampoo and conditioner seemed poor quality. No lotion. \"Free\" in room wifi required providing email and info for their mailing list. Location on fringe of great gaslamp quarter and uglier area with \"street people\". Intimidating for kids. Overall. Better choices available. Dont recommend using \"hotwire\" method of buying high rated room and finding out later where you get. Not really a family hotel. Restaurant, Saltbox. Very Good. As we checked in, another customer with a family, was asking for a room with 2 beds as he had booked with hotwire/expedia and received room with 1 bed. Front desk couldnt help and offered him more blankets for family to sleep on floor. I'm pleased I called ahead and paid \"upgrade\" for 2 beds. Now all I have to do is see if expedia will refund upgrade fee they promised to.

It's also adjacent to the House Of Blues which plays a lot of loud music. The walls and windows are well sound isolated, but if you step out on the balcony it's like a free nightclub experience. Parking must be expensive in that area of San Diego. They charge $36 for valet parking, but there's a garage across the street that's still $28. You actually might as well go with the valet even though that price sounds ludicrous. They give you a number you can text when you want to get your car so it'll be waiting for you.

The complimentary wine get together for guests is a nice touch, but the wine selections need to be upgraded just a bit, especially when you're that close to so many boutique wineries.

Walking to most restaurants and attractions was easy. On our first night (late arrival), the front desk manager recommended the \"Yard House\", just around the corner.

Upside: great service, rooms, amenities, and location. Nothing felt like they were cutting corners on anything, they provided some great robes to use during the stay, and the best part, friendly staff. Downside: there is some crazy club poolside on the weekends that blasts music late in to the night, penetrating every square inch of the room, and we were on the 14th floor. I sleep like a log, and we got in late, so I was fine. My boyfriend on the other hand requested some earplugs from the front desk and they were promptly sent to the room. They even pumped the jams in the rain when there was little or no one there. Trust me, I could look through the glass roof and directly down to the pool/club. The view is spectacular and if your intention is to enjoy the nightlife of the city and get in late, you will be fine. Otherwise, I would recommend a room on the opposite side of the pool. Additionally, you will feel raked over the coals with the valet parking, but parking in general is a bear in downtown, so you would be hard pressed to do any better unless you choose to find parking yourself and don't mind waking up at 3-5 a.m. in the morning to move your car.

We were very fortunate to book a fantastic room on the 19th floor of Hotel Palomar. The view was stunning and the room was so beautiful. The front desk was very helpful with suggestions about what to see within walking distance. We went over to Seaport Village (just a 20 minute walk) and enjoyed a beautiful waterfront stroll. The hotel had many amenities such as free wine from 4 - 5pm and an Escalade that drove us to the restaurant. We really liked that. The personal Keurig coffee / tea maker in the room was a fun treat for us too. We didn't buy wine while out on the town, but, if we did, our room had a temp controlled wine fridge. : ) Even the bathroom was lovely with a TV in the mirror - I put it on a music channel while we were getting ready to go out to dinner. We didn't need anything extra, but, there was a sign in the bathroom that said if we forgot anything, they would get it for us -- even if it was not the regular stuff, like a toothbrush. I had never heard of a hotel that would do that. Good to know for future reference. There was a flat screen TV in both the \"living room\" area and the bedroom too.

At the risk of sounding ungrateful, there are a few things that need to fine-tuned at the Palomar. -Housekeeping of my particular room. The carpet in the living room was stained, really stained. It needs to be shampooed and soon. In addition, the previous guest left several items of trash in the drawers of the walk-in closet. From the receipts that were left behind and the boxes, it must have been a really wild time. When as a guest you find these things, it makes you wonder\u2026what else isn\u2019t clean. -The bathroom. There are absolutely no, we\u2019re talking zero towel racks/hooks. Strange for a hotel chain that prides itself on reduce/reuse. -Window coverings/drapes. There are zero blinds/drapes/window coverings in the living room/kitchen/dining area which is fine. Just be mindful that you are in full-public view. The window coverings in the bedroom are poor.

What we wanted from a hotel in San Diego was a hotel with a roof pool, in the Gaslamp district. The flights for UK leave San Diego late in the evening, so we thought we could have a day chilling out by the pool, before leaving in the evening to catch our flight. Prior to leaving UK we decided that we were going to stay in the Hotel Solamar (bear with me here!), and I was supposed to book it after checking with my wife it was the hotel we wanted. A couple of days before leaving I realized I had forgotten to book it, and the price had jumped by about 30% - so I decided to leave it and gamble we would find somewhere either when we arrived, and I would keep an eye on websites for deals. About a week before we arrived I checked Expedia and found the Solamar hotel, for the original price we had been looking at. At least I thought I had! I had actually booked the Palomar. After some e-mail checking to ensure we had booked the correct hotel (there is also a Palomar in San Fran I believe) we arrived at the Palomar. First thing we found was there was no car park. I'm not a fan of valet parking, as I am more than capable of parking a car, however the guys were very helpful with the parking, and gave me directions to the car park they use, and I managed to get 2 nights and 3 days (Thurs, Fri and Sat) for $30 pre paid - multiple entry. Check-in was very pleasant, and we were well looked after. The room was large, well decorated, free wi-fi, and clean. Looked like it had recently been decorated. The whole hotel was very, very nice, and in a great location for Gaslamp district. 2nd Kimpton on our trip, and very impressed. Knowing we would be checking out at lunchtime and sitting round the pool all day, we asked about access to somewhere to shower before we left and were told they would check with the Spa to see if we could use this, when we came to check out. On the Friday afternoon we went and sat by the pool, had a couple of drinks and relaxed. Perfect for what we wanted the following day. Unfortunately what we had not accounted for was that Saturday is obviously posing day by the pool. Lots of drunk, loud showy off people. Not the hotels fault - it was just the clientele that were there that day. So not as relaxing as we hoped, and only a small part of the pool area was in the Sun so we had to fight for a spot. Pool is nice though, and bar staff very welcoming. When we came to leave we were given access to the Spa to take a shower before we left. All in all I would probably give this place a 4.5 if there was a rating, but due to the staff helpfulness there (Valet guys giving their information for car park, and Nicole on reception for all of her assistance with Spa access, and other stupid questions I had!) - I will push the rating to a 5.

They may say they are a 4 star hotel. They are far from it. Valet is $36 a day, which is fine, if they did their job well. If I have to pay for this service, I expect to have my bags put in the car and the door opened for me. Instead, I was handed the keys and the gentleman said \"see ya later..\" Also, we left $200 sunglasses in the car, since the only time we use them when we drive, and they are now missing. We stayed at this hotel because my fiance just came home from a very long deployment. I called in advanced to see if I could set up the room for our romantic get-a-way. I was told no. They would not help me at all with any of my ideas. (I work in a very popular hotel on Miami Beach, I know customer service, and I received none.) Once we got into our room, we were shocked by our \"beautiful city view\". It was a view of a parking garage and a tall building. Also, when we wanted to take a shower, there was no hot water. When I called down, they said, \"we're working on it, you can come down to the spa to take a shower if you would like.\" I wish they would have told this when we checked in. The last thing that bothered me was the fact that we had to listen to the music playing until 2 am (we had no problem with it, since we figured we would be there). However, we got back from dinner and drinks pretty late and wanted to join the pool party around 12:45am, we were told we could not. I said we were guest of the hotel and we would like to have a drink here in the hotel. The lady at the counter said only people that were allowed in were the ones that were here earlier in the night. So instead we went to the room and had to listen to the party that we could not par take in. The decor and the bed were nice but I would never tell a friend and family to stay at this hotel. I am very sadden by the fact that my fiance, who just got home from a long, stressful deployment did not have a better stay.

The hotel is very nice, uber modern as you can see from the pics. We were upgraded to a room on the 8th floor w/ a balcony overlooking the pool/nightclub (on the 4th floor below). The balcony was awesome as we were there to party and it was cool to hang out over the club. However, beware the noise level is very loud until 2am (weekends). I would imagine this is true for all pool side rooms up to the 12-14th floors and higher. The staff is very good at attempting to make guest aware of this at check-in and provide quieter accommodations if possible. The rooms are very small (and ours was one of the larger ones). Bathrooms are designed with a glass sliding door that will offer NO privacy. Just beware - you will be very close to whomever you are sharing the room with. The shower is non-traditional w/ a rain-type shower and no door so it gets water on the bathroom floor and can get cold in the shower. The service is decent at best - not what you would expect from a 4-star hotel. The staff seems to be preoccupied with running the club on weekend nights and it gets very crowded in the lobby and elevators at night (weekend) because of the club. Overall, for me the hotel was fun, very cool (different than the typical Westin catering to the business traveler).

The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The lobby has this great big door - have to see it to imagine it. Pretty cool. Pretty minimal decor, making it seem tranquil. They have just become a Kimpton property - so don't know how that will affect things. Anyway, the room was on the 14th floor overlooking the pool side - ask for a room as far up as you can get since they have DJ music @ the pool until about 1:30 p.m. - so it may be noisy if you are closer to the pool. The room has lovely wood (or laminate) flooring in a dark color - there was a large window which actually opens. We had nice views, even could we Pt Loma and the Harbor. The room is a bit small, but worked for the two of us. The bed was amazing! So comfortable, I didn't want to leave. They have nice linens - 400 sheet count I believe. A nice duvet comfortable. A flat screen TV. There's a Keurig coffee maker, but it was in the closet - odd. Had to take it out and put it on the desk to work it. The bathroom had a tiled shower with a rain shower head - which had good pressure - it was very nice. The bathroom itself was a good size and could easily accommodate 2 people getting ready at the same time. The hotel offers a complimentary wine hour from 5 to 6 - that was very nice. The pool area is great, a bit small, on the 4th floor - with nicer loungers and a large bar and cabana area. There is a small gym, with nice equipment on the 2nd floor with floor to ceiling windows overlooking 5th St - kind of nice. The restaurant Suite & Tender, looked good.

The check in was seamless and we were offered an upgrade to a suite for $100 more. The 4th floor, apparently, is the pool floor, which is also where Siren club is located. We decided against it and stuck with our 4th floor room. The hotel did mention the 4th floor was noisy. Small room, but wasn't half-bad. The shower, like previous reviews, was not well thought out. Water all over the floor and you'd better be with someone who does not mind seeing you in the buff. The water on the floor did not bother me it is what it is. Room service menu is limited and we did not try it out. We did try calling around 1am for the limited overnight menu, but were told it's no longer available. Bummer. The bed was comfortable, but squeaky. Two of the light fixtures were unplugged, and our room was missing it's smoke detector. Simple oversight? No turndown service, either. Bummer x2 The noise from the club did not bother us. It's our belief that if you get your room via hotwire or any other discount website, you're placed on the 4th floor or anywhere near the pool. They're undesirable rooms, because anyone in their right mind would be bothered by the loud thumping and cussing and yelling from it's drunken patrons. The upsell to the larger suite for $100 more is to get you out of that mess, so to speak... Check out was a breeze. Now back to the older gentleman. He sits at a desk in the lobby, the mail man drops the mail on his desk, and he has a presence about him that adds to the Se. He's got an arrogant haughty type attitude, which fits this hotel perfectly. That's not a knock, however. It's a compliment and I'd welcome a chance to have wine with him during their free wine tasting on Friday. I'd come back if I got a good deal.
