Small rooms. Nice bathroom. Plenty of towels. No fridge in the room. Beds are comfy (I'm 6'3\"), but those square pillows (what are they even for?) BBC1, 2 and 3 on the room TV. Sexy little pool, small but OK fitness room (Concept Rower, 2 each Bikes and Treadmills, free towels, apples and chilled water). Nice little bar. Rubbish room service (selection, quality, service and price all unacceptable). Generally friendly though. The location is OK if you have reason to be in this part of town. Tram is nearby, Metro is 300m away. Don't bother with the local restaurants; especially the Versailles opposite. The best sushi value is the New Tokyaki, 300 m away. Otherwise walk up to Porte de Versailles, but be ready for price shock (\u20ac10 a pint of lager). There's a corner shop ( turn left out the front door and walk about 300m) which sells decent fruit, wine & beer, and biscuits! But what about that strange rumbling noise all night, like the lower deck of a cruise ship??? Recommendation: there are two Mercure Hotels very nearby, both of which have much nicer rooms, and you can usually get the same or better online rate. Personally I prefer the Mercure Vaugirard Porte de Versailles which is right outside the metro and tram stop with loads of bars, restaurants, and a supermarket within metres.

Of course there is a metro which is good and fast but you have to change one or two to arrive to the center. So it is not convinient for older people or families with young children. The surrounding is not interesting at all and you can not feel the heart of Paris. Room we have got was quite big for our three, two bathrooms and separated toilet. Cleaning was more or less done, although one day in retard, after 3 pm. Strange standards with towels not enough for us three. It was very hot in the room during the night and only what air con was producing was noise- so desperatly hot and no chance to open the window because of the noise from the large road crowded with cars going all the day and night. So if you go there ask for the courtyard room. Breakfast itself was good but take care of your bags one lady remained without it - money and all cards ( anyway watch your bags everywhere in Paris, especially in metro). Taxi is not so expensive some 15 - 25 Eur to the center of the town but if you intend to use it several times a day than you can take hotel closer to the center which I suggest to all of the visitors who come like tourists and not for bussines.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cRooms not clean\u201d", "Author": "Paris0210", "ReviewID": "UR60808576", "Content": "This hotel is definitely not a four star.

There are no tea and coffee making facilities in the room and, during our stay, both the hot and cold drink vending machines in the hotel foyer were out of order-suprise suprise. Therefore, to get a hot or cold drink, it was necessary to go to the extremely overpriced bar where the tiniest cup of coffee was four euros. I am also a smoker so duly asked about the smoking area as advised to do in the hotel information book in the room. I was then treated to a lecture by the less than professional receptionist about the dire consequences of smoking inside anywhere in France. I had absolutely no intention of smoking inside anymore than I do at home. I also asked one of the receptionists whether the trams went into Paris.

Very spacious, especially the shower room and a separate toilet. Bed felt brand new and everything was clean and tidy. In room safe was also included. One downside was that there was no in room tea/coffee making facilities so if you wanted a cup of coffee first thing in the morning you had to go down to the vending machines in reception. A flat screen TV was available showing a large range of channels including all the BBC channels. Breakfast was included in our tariff and it was very good. It's buffet style but you had a good choice of continental and hot foods with unlimited coffee and tea if needed. There's no restaurant in the hotel but that isn't a problem as just around teh corner was a large choice of Chinese, Japanese, Italian and French places to eat. I would recommend the Italian, L'Olivier. Drinks in the hotel are expensive but there is a very nice cafe/bar across the road which is cheaper.

I have stayed in Paris before with work and each time I have had a \u2018boutique\u2019 hotel as they call them which is by British standards a high-class guest house feel which is not to everyone\u2019s taste. The Oceania on the other hand is a nice change and has a Marriot/Holiday Inn feel but on a smaller scale\u2026a place where everything is modern, clean and comfortable. ARRIVAL - On arrival at the nearest Metro station (M12 - Porte de Versailles), exit the Metro and then get your bearings\u2026.you will see a tall MERCURE hotel on one side of the street. Now to avoid any confusion\u2026.the road that takes you to the Oceania hotel is directly OPPOSITE the Mercure hotel\u2026a reasonably long road with what appears to be a bridge half way down the street. Follow this road and you will arrive at the Oceania\u2026.you cannot miss it. On entering the hotel you have a nice check-in desk with three individual desks on your left with very pleasant and helpful staff. On the right as you enter there is probably 6 or 7 chairs/sofas for you to relax and wait for a taxi or read a paper. Next to the sofas there are 3-4 vending machines serving a range of food, snacks and drinks (soft and alcoholic). Opposite the chairs there are three lifts all well presented and clean taking you to your floors\u2026there are 6 floors in the hotel. On entering our room we were pleased that it was clean and modern with a nice sized bed. There is a separate toilet as you enter with a small sink\u2026.then as you walk into the room further there is a bed on the one side facing a 22\u201d wall-mounted LCD TV with desk and chair. There is a very modern wet-room also in the main room (see the pics to get the idea) which has a rain-shower and long washbasin with mirrors. I must say that all the bathroom fittings were quality and the moulded basin etc was made from the high-end Corian material (good stuff if you are into your kitchens or bathroom fittings!). One good point to note is that our room had a window that actually opened fully\u2026really good when the room gets a bit warm, and unlike the UK where health and safety means you can only open your window an inch in most hotels! Aircon unit was also in the room as is Wi-Fi available for 10Euro per day. Now to the facilities\u2026 BAR AREA \u2013 this is in the basement (-1) level and is very modern club/bar feel. No actual windows but feels very clean with lots of soft-changing LED lighting giving a very fresh and funky feel. The place gets you in the mood for a drink until you see the prices of the drinks themselves. Cocktails around 10-15Euros and Beers around 8-10 Euros. Not the place to spend the night, but nice atmosphere all the same, and drinks served with some nibbles. The bar area overlooks the pool too with floor to ceiling glass making. POOL/GYM AREA \u2013 this is a lovely addition to a Paris hotel. The gym is basic with a handful of essential training equipment, but nice all the same if you want to do a quick run or workout. The pool again feels new and modern with a perfectly sized pool area with Jacuzzi in the one corner. As you enter the pool you have women\u2019s and men\u2019s changing rooms and a room for massage if you choose to take one. On entering the changing rooms, Iike the rest of the hotel, you feel that all the fixtures and fittings are quality. Lots of rolled up towels to help yourself and a few showers. At the end of the changing room is a steam room (Hammam) which is quite large and a nice touch (note male and female changing rooms have their own steam room \u2013 there is not a mixed steam room). Open up your locker and you will find a towel and slippers already in the locker \u2013 nice touch. We enjoyed the leisure facilities and in particular the pool has in two corners of the pool very forceful jets coming from the floor and side\u2026.perfect for standing on and giving your feet a good blast back into life after walking the streets of Paris. It really did help you to unwind at the end of your day. To access the pool and gym area, you need to swipe your room card to get access to the area. BREAKFAST \u2013 we booked on a bed & breakfast basis and must say that we were pleasantly surprised by the ample buffet breakfast in the morning. They seem to cater for most tastes and requirements! First off a basket of fresh Danish pastries, croissants and pain-au-choclat. Next there were a few different cereals. A very large bowl of fresh mixed fruit was next to this with various yogurts to choose from. Next to this there were bread and toaster for your toast! Next to this a bowl of fresh fruit of apples, bananas, pears to eat (or take away!). Over the other side there were a selection of juices to help yourself to\u2026.and a few dishes of hot food\u2026.scrambled egg, German looking sausages, streaky bacon and grilled tomatoes. Finally a plate of meats and cheese. There was essentially something for everyone.\u2026.and now for my favourite bit as I\u2019m a coffee lover. They had two proper coffee making machines (bean-to-cup) where you can help yourself to a FRESH cup of coffee. I travel with my work and in my experience so many good hotels serve poor coffee in the morning that often tastes burnt! Not at the Oceania\u2026you can take a fresh coffee as you like it\u2026from Espresso to Cappuccino and everything in between! For the tea lover, they have a basket of different teas to choose from and a hot water function to fill; up your teapot. In summary, we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at the Oceania. For the money we paid and the facilities at this hotel, we felt it was exceptional value at \u00a3120/night (we booked via www.Octopustravel.com).", "Date": "June 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cStress from the staff\u201d", "Author": "estee36", "ReviewID": "UR28132775", "Content": "I have just returned from my holiday to Paris and felt that overall my holiday was brilliant and the real let down was the hotel that me and my friend stayed at.

One other problem was the cleaning staff disturbing us at 9 o'clock in the morning... no-one wants to wake up early on holiday?! One morning my friend had vomited on the bed after a night out and the cleaners failed to remove all the dirty/stained sheets (it might have looked clean, but underneath the duvet it wasn't!) and after ringing reception numerous times and managing to get hold of the manager, he for some strange reason was in denial about the dirty sheets! My friend lost her temper in the end and after arguing with him he sent up a middle-aged man to change it.

So if you are you looking for some place nice to stay at where you are close to your convention with nice amenities where you can pop back and forth to the convention and have a really clean, modern room, then this is the perfect choice. However, if you are hoping to experience Paris on top of your convention, then this is not the place for you. It is in the middle of nowhere. If you plan on staying up past 11:00, forget this place. All of the cafe's nearby are closed by 11:00 and there is absolutely nothing to do. Even before 11:00 there are only limited choices. This is a convention hotel and the sidewalks, such as they are, are rolled up very early in the evening. Those cafes and restaurants you will find nearby are limited in both selections and embience. If you plan on getting up early and catching the metro downtown to see the sights and then getting back and going straight to bed, this is probably OK for you. The metro is convenient and you can get to most major sites fairly quickly. If you like the night life in any way, even just to sit at a cafe and enjoy the evening, do not stay here. There is no night life here. Everything is closed. Personally, I would not stay here again. The metro can take you to the convention center fairly quickly from a hotel further down the line and you will have far better choices for what to do when the convention ends at those places than this one. The absolute dead feeling of the area around this hotel kills off the feeling of being in Paris for me, and that far outweighs the relative moderninity of the actualy hotel.

I expected having to get up super early to avoid the rush before all the food was gone, but the choice was great and the food was bountiful irregarless of what time we went (between 7-10am). It buffet included Bread, croissant and pain-au-chocolat, selection of cold meats, hot bacon, eggs, sausages, fruit salad, fruits, yoghurts freshly squeezed juices, cheese and spreads, and lots of variations of coffees and teas and more. The area itself is quite nice. Porte de Versaille is in the South of Paris (get the dark-green Line 12). Any Irish passengers travelling with Ryan Air to Beauvais are dropped by bus to Porte Maillot in the West of the city. It's just a matter of walking around the shopping centre immediately infront of the bus depot, getting the yellow line, changing at Concorde and down to Porte de Versaille. There's quite a few Restaurants nearby, some better than others but that's up to personal taste. The hotel is pretty visible when you surface from the metro line. It's a particularly nice area. Walking along the street to the left of the hotel's entrance, there are plenty of shops (usually open until 8), bakeries and more restaurants. There's aso a vibrant market that sells local produce and clothing etc. We bought snacks and wine and spirits in one shop in particular and saved an absolute fortune. We brought it for a picnic in the Trocadero Gardens while taking a break from strolling around the city. I wouldn't recommend the bar in the hotel, not because it has a bad atmosphere, but because it's ridiculously expensive (12euro for a Jack Daniels). All in all a fabulous weekend, and to top it all off, my boyfriend proposed!", "Date": "March 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton", "Title": "\u201cAll great, except staff\u201d", "Author": "evw89", "ReviewID": "UR10045874", "Content": "We booked our room on ratestogo.com a week before we left and got a very food price for this 4* hotel.

The rooms however were lovely - modern furniture, the comfiest bed I have ever slept on in a hotel, a great shower and they were kept extremely clean. The TV is a plasma and has plenty of channels and radio stations. The location is great - a 20 minute journey (5 min walk, 15 mins metro) into the centre of Paris, and quiet. Even though it is on a main road, the double glazing blocks out all sound from the outside. We never ate breakfast at the hotel due to the price but instead found small caf\u00e9s in Paris to eat. The pool in the hotel is a lovely heated pool with a large jacuzzi and we found it perfect for relaxing after a long day navigating Paris via the metro (which is very well set out and very easy to use) Overall I would recommend this hotel for it's location, rooms and facilities (although the bar was overpriced), but be prepared for unfriendly staff.", "Date": "October 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!!\u201d", "Author": "DishGagan", "ReviewID": "UR10039407", "Content": "Stayed at this excellent hotel for three nights and found it to of a very high standard.

The only downside of the hotel is the breakfast, its absolutely horrible and a complete rip off at 15euros each, there is plenty of places to eat near by and there is a Mcdonalds about 10mins on the left of the hotel.

Staff - all the staff talk english. they were friendly and willing to help us. we left our luggages on the chek-in day (we came at 12:00 and the room wasn't ready), and on the chek-out day (we had flight only at midnight, so we left the luggages till 20:00). room - very clean, everything is new and well decorated. the shower is excellent and very big. king size bed. double windows so no noise from outside. A/C. facilities - since it was our first visit in paris, we didn't had the time to enjoy the spa, pool and Jacuzzi. so, as summary - it is not cheap, but my G.F and I were very glad to come back and to know that we will have a pleasent shower and good sleep. so we think that this place worth the money that we paid for. how to get there? take the metro line 12 to \"mairie d'issy\", get down at station \"porte de versailles\", find the exit (sortie in French) \"... sport\" (i don't remember teh full name of it). now as you are going up the stairs, continue a head about 200 meter. you will get to small road junction and the hotel is just there infront of you. enjoy all.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cNice modern hotel, near Metro with bar,pool, gym and parking\u201d", "Author": "mgibbons", "ReviewID": "UR8457324", "Content": "My wife and kids loved this hotel. We'd originally stayed at the Classic which is just around the corner but they didn't like the lack of a communal area which, coupled with the fact that the hotel is on the outskirts of Paris and so lacking the wealth of local nightlife, prompted us to move. When I showed them this one they just loved it. The rooms are not large - but that is common for all the Parisien hotels - but it is very modern, clean and quiet (the windows are quadruple glazed!). The basement has a large bar area from which you can watch the kids in the pool. We got a fantastic deal through ratestogo.com (140 euro's per night) however even if you paid the full price of 285 euro's I still think you'd be satisfied. The breakfast - although pricey at 15 euro's - was very good and the service excellent. There's good parking undeneath the hotel at 15 euro's per day.
