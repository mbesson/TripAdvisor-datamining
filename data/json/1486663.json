Nice size rooms, with 2 double beds, microwave, small frig. tv, table and 2 chairs to eat by and dresser. Nice bathroom with hair dryer and ofcourse sink, toilet and shower. The rooms where very clean and also have air conditioners which i forgot to mention. It was a good location about a block from the beach and about 5 blocks or so from where the boardwalk starts. I booked the room off the internet and unfortunately the worse thing was the room we got (room 308) really didn't have a view of anything because the building is shaped like and L.

Upon driving up, my boyfriend was quite concerned, let out a sigh and said \"it is what it is.\" I was very pleased with not only the economical pricing of the Executive, but thoroughly pleased with the staff and the cleanliness. I am also happy to report there were no all night parties ongoing during my visit, much to the dismay of my daughters. Sleeping was incredible. I felt right at home and woke every morning rested with no back ache's. I have to say, Ms. Jeanne sold me as soon as we walked through the door of the lobby. Just meeting such a fantastic soul made our experience worth while. The rooms are clean and the bathroom reminded me of an old school bathroom...like when I was a child, but it too was clean and the shower was awesome. Plenty of hot water and pressure. There was no mold, nor musty smell, which I expected giving the age of the place. I have been traveling to Ocean City for the past 40 years and would often drive right past the Executive. I am so very pleased that I took that chance. I most definitely WILL be returning in the future. Ms. Jeanne you are truly amazing and your giving credit to the dedication and pride of the maid staff and the owners was uplifting. That place would not be the same without you and the trememously staff. By the way, happy to report... by the end of the weekend, my boyfriend told me that I did a wonderful job selecting this place and that he was sorry for doubting me.

I think most people would agree, staying at a new hotel when you go on any vacation is a little nerve-wrecking. You can take the virtual tours, read the reviews online, but those don't always add up. Before we even arrived, we called ahead to ask if we could at least get our parking pass even though it was hours before check-in time. The response we got, I could hear the enthusiasm in the womans voice and I wasn't even the one making the call. As soon as we walked in the door, we got a very warm welcome from the lady behind the desk. (I'm sorry I don't remember her name!). She was very nice, very happy. The room we stayed in was better than what we were expecting. Very spacious, very clean, the beds were super comfortable. The only 2 things that we would have to \"complain\" about would be the pool which was very small, however the beach was literally right across the street so it evened out. And the parking was a little hectic, but even then the management was very helpful in helping us find a spot when the lot was full. I can't speak for my friend, but I'm almost positive that she would agree that we will for sure be returning customers!

The only thing we didn't like is that we had to pay for the ice machine. I have never been to a motel or hotel where you had to pay for the ice. It cost .25 to fill the tiny bucket they provide in the room. Which would probably cost $7 to fill our cooler, so we took a bus downtown and bought a big bag for much cheaper. Also we had an issue with our upstairs neighbors (a group of senior boys partying like crazy) sounding like a herd of elephants, but once we mentioned it to the front desk the issue was immediately taken care of. We absolutely loved our stay and it was for a great price! Coming from Fort Whaley campground where our stay was miserable, full of cockroaches and mosquitoes, thunderstorms, and poor front desk service, once arriving at the Executive on the spot we immediately felt the hospitality and warm greetings from Miss Jeanie.

When i talked to the receptionist she said they had just won the BBB 2010 award. It has a nice location a block away from the beach, good parking, it is a few blocks from the boardwalk which is good and bad, mostly quiet, some HS and college kids still partying. i liked that the agreement you sign on check in state no loud music, underage drinking etc, give a sense of safety. pool was small but nice and clean. i was very shocked when on our second day we arrived and the room was not cleaned. i called the front desk and they said the maid had left, they then threw at me towels and sheet plus the vaccuum. yes I myself had to vaccuum and the darn thing didn't even work!! when i went in the next dayto the front desk i asked for a number or email to contact the owner, the guy across the desk couldn't get me anything and said that i was supposed to put the sign on the door to have the room cleaned, which is foolish, i have never heard of that. I was told that the manager/owner would call but i never heard from anyone. i don't know what happaned, i would like an explanation and a discount, but overall i can't say this wasn't a bad place to stay for a last minute long weekend no frills place.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johnstown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay!\u201d", "Author": "nikkielynn07", "ReviewID": "UR66377260", "Content": "My boyfriend and I stayed at this motel from May 30th to June 3rd. After reading the reviews on here about almost every motel in OC, we booked this motel, unsure of what it would be like. We definitely were surprised. It's located on 30th street and Baltimore avenue. It's in a great location because its 2 streets away from the boardwalk, so it was easy to walk over there and back. The motel is older so the building doesn't look too nice from the outside, but it has three floors, and no elevator, so it sucked carrying all of our things up the steps. The room and pool were small, but were exactly what was described and shown on the virtual tour on its website. They gave us the room that they showed on the virtual tour, room 317, which is right on the end on the third floor. From its location, it had a good view of the ocean from behind the Flamingo motel, which made us feel closer to the beach. If you stay here, definitely try to get room 317 or 316, because you'll have the best view. Check in was at 2, but we arrived at 1 and they had our room all ready. The parking lot in the front of the motel was full so we had to park in the back, which made us nervous because we couldn't see the car from our room. However, the parking lot quickly cleared out and we moved the car. The staff were extremely friendly. The lady at the front desk that checked us in was very nice, as well as the owner. Every time she saw us she made sure we were enjoying our trip and asked us how we liked the room. The maids were very nice and they kept our room clean. There was no mold or anything nasty in the room. It did have the musty sea smell, but other than that it was very clean. The only real complaints I had were that there was a little window in the room straight across from the door, that had no curtain or blind. The sun was very bright coming through it in the morning and at night you could see the bright lights coming in from Coastal Highway. Also, there was no counter space in the bathroom. Other than that everything else was great. Since our trip was during an offseason time, the room rate was very cheap, and after the first day, there were hardly any other people staying at the motel, so it was nice and quiet all week. it was nice because you couldn't hear any sounds coming from outside in the room. The room was great for what we used it for, we didn't spend a huge amount of time in it, but sat on the balcony a lot, which was very nice. I definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a cheap motel that is clean with a friendly staff!", "Date": "June 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBetter Than Expected\u201d", "Author": "Jsoc", "ReviewID": "UR39067113", "Content": "It is what it is...if you're looking for a budget hotel, close to the beach, this place is fine.

The room was clean. No wierd odors or anything else. The front desk woman, was very nice and helpful. Very accomodating for extra towels and stuff. You park right in front of your room, and walk to the beach in less than a minute. It's a 5 block walk to the boardwalk. There is a tram that will take you to the other end of the boardawalk, where there's much more going on. The have a pool. It is very small, but it was very clean.

We had a wonderful time at the Executive Motel. We were on a budget so we chose the Executive knowing full well that it was a dated motel.

When we checked in later in the day we were greeted by a lovely woman who managed the property. She told us where everything was and gave us lots of information to make our stay enjoyable. Very friendly! When it was bedtime, I went to the front desk and asked for blankets. I was asked how many I would like and she promptly brought us four blankets to our room. All the rooms are non-smoking and extremely clean!!!! even though they are dated. They have comfortable pillows (huge plus) and comfortable mattresses.
