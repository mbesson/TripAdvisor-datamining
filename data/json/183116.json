The bag breakfast was not great, but it was provided at no extra cost so it is hard to complain about something free.... The shuttle driver to the airport was helpful and got us there quickly. The best aspect of this hotel as a park and fly hotel is the convenience to the 401 at the end of our trip.

The rooms, and for that matter, the whole hotel, was clean and very quiet. Rooms are adequate for a night's stay and certainly for a good price. The location is right next to the 401 Hwy which gives you a short hop to most locations in Toronto. Downtown can be a short 20 minute trip. While there are no other facilities within walking distance, there is lots within a short drive.

I got back to the hotel around midnight and as I stepped off the elevator I was hit with a cloud of Marijuana smoke. The entire floor was filled with it. I got to my room and could hear doors slamming people yelling and swearing down the hall. I looked out the peep-hole and caught a glimpse of who I was sharing a floor with and knew I was in for a long night. I woke up at around 2 am to the sound of more yelling, swearing and slamming of doors. Several calls to the front desk failed to put a stop to the disruption that was happening. Then a fight broke out in the room beside me and I could hear one person being severely beaten. After this the individuals proceeded to absolutely trash the room they were staying in. I felt as if they were going to come through the wall of my room at any moment. I am not exaggerating when I say that my girlfriend and I were scared for our safety. The police finally showed up (about 5 hours after I had first called the front desk) to forcibly evict these people. They had to call an ambulance for the individual who had been attacked who was barely conscious. So I ended up falling asleep around 8am and had to be up at 10am to check out The hotel did refund my night but I will still never stay at a Quality or any of the Choice Hotels ever again. The hotel acted very irresponsibly by renting rooms to people paying cash and not even bothering to check up on the floor they were staying on. They also brought in several guests which were not part of the original booking and would have walked right past the front desk staff on their way into the hotel. A simple check of the floor once would have revealed the rampant illegal drug use that was taking place. Instead the staff left it up to me to report what was going on in their hotel. As I said earlier, these people looked like bad news and the fact that they would rent them a room period is of particular concern. The reason I stayed here was to rest up after a trip before making a 5 hour drive home. Instead I got about 2 hours of sleep then had to drive home exhausted putting our safety at risk. I would have got a better sleep in the airport or my car.

We booked with our credit card but paid the $111.36 (that was clearly stated on our booking confirmation that I printed off) in cash when we arrived, we were charged a $200 deposit on the room bringing the total to $311.36 which was fine. When we returned to the hotel after parking our vehicle, I asked if we could get a wake up call for 2am as we had to be at the airport at 3 to check in for our flight, to which point the girl at the front desk informs us that their 24 HOUR SHUTTLE SERVICE TO THE AIRPORT DOESN'T START UNTIL 3:15 AM!!!!

When I showed her my confirmation that the room was $111.36 she said \"Well that is a mistake and whoever checked you in should have noticed that\" when we told her we were not paying a dollar over what was on our confirmation she then tried to tell us that there was tax on the deposit and tried to blame the girl who checked us in again for not telling us that. When we told her it was not our problem that the person checking us in did not inform us of the tax (which we knew was absolute crap) she finally agreed to give us the full 200.00 deposit back but not before turning to her co-worker and saying \"I wish they would stop posting the wrong price on the website\" So first she tries to place blame on the individual who checked us in, then proceeds to claim that prices posted on their website are inaccurate...make up your mind, lady!!!!

The driver said we would have to wait for the next one at least a half hr more. we were so cold from standing outside in -5 degree temps for a hr. finally the driver came back at 11:54 we got into the shuttle and he had a airfreshner hanging off his seat my husband removed it because I am allergic to scents however I still suffered an astma attack when the driver realized I was not breathing very well he drove quickly to the hotel and I got what I needed. The driver told us the one driver was told their was a pick up but when he got to c22 no one was their so he was at end of shift and just went to finish his rounds. I think he should of done what the other shuttles did and ask people with suitcases where they were going not just driving by them. I also think their should be more than one shuttle when it is winter when people are coming from 95 degree weather to -5 it's not good to be standing their for a hr and a half. now my husband and 1 daughter are both sick it was not a good end to a beautiful vacation.

They advised tha actual park and fly rate was $135.00 which was the same as everyone else. I asked if that included the shuttle and we were advised it did and the shuttle would be there in 5 minutes. I booked the room by credit card and then was told the shuttle would be at least a half an hour. Not wanting to cut our arrival that close we took a cab at a cost of $20.00.

We landed at the airport and the shuttle was not there so took a cab at a cost of $28.00.

We explained our situation and that we had cancelled the room and we were told to take it up with the manager tomorrow. I did contact the manager and supplied the website that the original booking was made from and sent a copy of the email we received confirming our room cancellation.

You can either go closer to the airport, or drive down Islington and turn east on Bloor to Bloor Village West, where there are a lot. Amenities: As a previous reviewer mentioned, internet service sucks. We had the managment call the provider and while there was slight improvement it was generally not at an acceptable level. Hence we would strongly recommend that business travelers need high-spped access stay away. Rest of the hotel is pretty basic, and restaurant is very dull and artificial looking. We only stopped there for one overpriced brreakfast. Cleanliness: Despite generous tips, housekeeping got lazy duing out five night stay and stopped vacuuming our room. Overall, this would be an okay choice for tourists with a car or for people like us using reward points from Choice Hotels.

We contacted reception & were told that someone would come and change them. About 20 mins later we got a phone call from reception to tell us to go down & collect a key for another room. This meant that we had to get dressed again, go down to reception, stand in line for reception for about 10 mins, then get a key, go back upstairs, pack all our stuff again & then move rooms (remember this was around midnight). We asked to speak to a manager and were told that there was no manager on duty but that they would inform the manager of the issue in the morning. The following morning, we asked to speak to a manager & again were told that there was none on duty and the girl did not know that we had a problem or that we had moved room.

Staff give you a piece of paper that you must put on dashboard to avoid ticket/tow. Parking is free (rare for airport area) and generally well-lit.

Elevator smelled smokey, as did another floor when I got ice. Ice machine on some floors, snacks and $1.25 canned pop machine on some others. Room had 2 double beds, table and two chairs, closet (with a hard-to-open door because of the carpet height) with iron & board and two collapsable/portable luggage racks. Four bin long dresser. TV was fine, but no tv checkout. Coffeemaker with Van Houtte coffee. Two generic but okay prints above the headboards. Window coverings - on a window that partly opened - were sheers and blackout drapes. Heat/air controlled by wall thermostat.

The light fixture over the bed was particularly bad and didn't even have a light bulb when we arrived. The side chair fell apart when we moved it. We were there four nights (stuck with a pre-paid reservation) and the smoke alarm in our room went off several times while we were there. We eventually figured out it was any time we took a shower. The first time was pretty scary, but we eventually just plugged our ears or left the room. We called the front desk when it happened the first time and they didn't seem to be concerned. They said they'd send someone to our room, but no one ever showed up. I hope their service is better in a real emergency. Someone turned several of the hallway lights sideways one night and it was three days before the staff ever fixed them. Service as a whole in the hotel was nearly non-existent.
