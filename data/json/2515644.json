For the price we couldn't have done better. The rooms are bare minimum, with only a (very firm, yet comfortable) double bed, tv, a metal folding chair and some seemingly homemade nightstands. We booked last minute so we couldn't get a room in the building with the marina view, instead we were in the back building. The view from our room's window was completely blocked by a shed outside but the bathroom window let in light (and views of the parking lot). The location across from the marina is nice but we found that unless you are on a boat there isn't much to do in Point Loma, so we had to cab it to nearby areas for fun times.

You read all the reviews before this one and say \"it can't be true\" and sure, there's no way this 2* basic hotel should be in the top ten in San Diego...absolutely no way. It's happened to me twice before, in Paris and Washington and both times due to the honesty and diligence of Tripadvisor reveiwers. This little gem is so highly rated because of a good business model fearlessly executed by a father and son duo who know what they're doing. With the right staff behind them they have created a motel that suits their clientelle. Spotlessly clean rooms, so small there's no room for all this traveller's \"stuff\" (it's fine, I leave it in the car, it's safe there!) are maintained by lovely Lynn to a standard of which other hotels dream. Yes, the walls are paper thin and if you're downstairs you will hear the bump of everything falling to the floor above you...and you'll hear the guest outside your room at 3.00 in the morning, on the phone to an irate lover: but you'll say \"I felt safe and cared for and I was in a quiet neighbourhood, unlike many who stay in much more expensive hotels with 10 lane freeways passing their window!\" It's not logical to give 2* hotels 6/5 (and I haven't!) but this one deserves your closest consideration. Three nights would start to grate a bit but for two...you can do a lot with the dollars you save by staying here. It's easy to find and the staff will do ANYTHING to make your stay memorable. Breakfast is outside, free and fun, even after it's rained! You can get top meals in the evening at Jimmy's All American Diner or Pizza Nova within 5 minute's walk and be on the Intestates within 5 minutes too (free parking here, don't forget).

For whatever reason I guess we expected to have a table in the room as well, but I don't know where they would have put it! Also the bathroom is one of the smallest I've ever been in, a chubby person might have issues turning around in the shower :-) VERY clean tho. The the heating/AC unit was right above the head of the single bed and was too noisy for us to leave on at night. You'll want to close the bathroom door as there's a light that shines in thru the window at night. We booked this motel based on the TripAdvisor reviews and felt just a bit let down. It was definitely not a bad experience, especially for the reasonable price - however depending on the luck of the draw from a room perspective you may feel a bit cramped.

The property is a wood (rather than tip-up concrete) frame builiding, built in 1957. Over the years there have been minor changes to various walls (new a/c, moved towel racks, et al) so the walls are not perfectly smooth. A power cable to the a/c and the cable to the 32 inch flat screen t.v. were both surface mounted on the walls. The windows are double pane but you can hear a loud motorcycle on occasion. And because the walls are wood/drywall you might hear the next door heat pump a/c turn on. What you WILL get is a comfortable quality mattress, fluffy white towels, all white bedding--the owner was justly proud of using a white bedspread to show how clean it was instead of the typical mottled dark colors in use elsewhere. The owners, who were there every day, and all the office staff were unfailingly polite, helpful, and full of suggestions for places to go and things to see. As a lark I walked over to the Vagabond motel which is a block away and also well reviewed. The price I was quoted was $26 dollars per day more than The Dolphin. For the $26 we would have had a little plastic bottle of shampoo every day, a slightly larger selection of breakfast rolls and 100 more square feet of space.

We love traveling around the area and so most of the time we spend in a hotel is to sleep and take a shower, well we had just what we needed and it was clean, efficient and just right. The folks there are so nice and very helpful. We arrived in SD around 9 AM and our room was all ready for us to take a nap after traveling all night. That in itself was a very pleasant surprise. And that it is located right in the middle of all of the boat action, yacht clubs, we were delighted. We decided to use public transit, so the bus stop was right there, and it was easy to connect with the trolley as well. We have rented cars before while visiting, but because it was so easy to get around using transit, we loved staying there at the Dolphin. We weren't at all disturbed by noise from the street, but if you have a problem with that, just use ear plugs, but truthfully the white noise from the air unit took care of that.

Do not hesitate to stay at the Dolphin, of course if you would rather spend a lot of money go elsewhere. We love the Dolphin and hope all reads this as a total 100% recommendation.I do think that this is one for quieter people, they don't allow loud parties so be mindful of that.There are places in the area for partying, just call a cab to get home. Or do like us and walk. One highlight for us was the trip to Pt Loma lighthouse, just walk down the street and catch the bus, it is a beautiful place.

To be honest, we weren\u2019t sure what to expect even though the Dolphin does not advertise that they are a luxury hotel. Well, when we got there, we went into the office area. It\u2019s small. They don\u2019t have a lobby nor an official bellman or concierge. But we were warmly welcomed by Jeb who checked us in for our four night stay. We received the keys to the room. I had requested a quiet room which, even though they were completely booked, they saved for me. We opened up the door and wasn\u2019t sure what to think. The room is small and as advertised, completely white except for the carpet. It felt sterile and unwelcoming. We moved in and started to check things out. The TV was great and had a wide range of channel selections. The chair was a simple fold up card table type chair. There was a luggage rack and white end tables on each side of the bed and a closet that had no door. There was also a larger than dorm size refrigerator. The bathroom was just as simple \u2026 sink, toilet and a stand up shower, no tub. The amenities were limited to soap and toilet paper. The room has a wall unit for heating or cooling that was very efficient. There were windows that you could open to let fresh air in or check out the weather. So, luxury it is not. But, we didn\u2019t need luxury. The room was clean and we had only planned to spend time there to sleep. What you don\u2019t always get in a luxury hotel that we definitely had at the Dolphin was sincerity and service that you can\u2019t really put a price on. I need extra pillows to sleep and Jeb went hunting for just the right pillows for me. And unfortunately for us, it rained during our stay in San Diego. The owner went to his car to offer my husband his umbrella to use while we were there. Jeb gave us great dinner recommendations. The continental breakfast they offer was good and just what we needed to start our day. And the location of the hotel couldn\u2019t be better. We found easy access to everything we wanted to see. So, did we get what we paid for? Probably, in terms of the room itself. Although in the room\u2019s defense, it was home for us and very comfortable even without the frills. And it met my expectations in terms of quiet. But we got MORE than what we paid for in terms of friendliness and service. They deserve to be rated highly. My only recommendation for those considering a stay at the Dolphin is to pack as if you were going camping. While each room did not have a hair dryer or an ironing board and iron, you could borrow it from the office. But I was fine just bringing all my own stuff!

I discovered it, back whenever, because I was staying at a chain motel next door. In walking around Point Loma, I noticed the Dolphin's marquee with its beckoning to \"see a room\" and \"why pay more\". So, I did. And thank God I did. I've been a regular ever since that day. With the Dolphin Motel you get a nice, little family-owned motel with really comfortable and clean rooms, breakfast served every morning, a welcoming and cordial staff, and all of this is at a price, which the surrounding motels can't touch. On my latest visit, I was warmly greeted by Tom, as I exited my Taxi from the airport, and he quickly checked me in. Steve has been at the reception desk for years and he greets guests as they pass the office on their way to whereever. And, of course, there is Alan and his father, who are around the premises all day long looking after the property and guests' needs. Another interesting thing about the Dolphin Motel, is that many guests come from all parts of the world, and most of them learned about the Dolphin from www.tripadvisor.com . This gives the atmosphere at breakfast, especially, a true international feeling with different accents and languages being spoken. As I said in the title to this posting, if you stay at the Dolphin Motel while in San Diego, you will have two reasons to return to S.D. First, you will want to again experience the hospitality of the Dolphin Motel, and second, well, they don't call San Diego \"America's Finest City\" for nothing!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peoria, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cIt was great to be back!\u201d", "Author": "audreymahoney", "ReviewID": "UR120303472", "Content": "I couldn't find where to write the new review so I ended up reading all the previous ones to get here!

The main thing that changed my mind was not just that it is one of the most affordable motels in San Diego, but that it's proprietor takes the time to read all these reviews and actually responds to many of them. That is the mark of someone who truely cares about his business. My husband and I stayed at the Dolphin for 5 days towards the end of October. Although the weather was disappointing the Dolphin was not. The building itself is an older building but it is very well maintained. Yes, the rooms are small, but the bed is very comfortable and the room was very clean and everything in it worked great - especially the shower (great water pressure!). A continental style breakfast was provided every morning in the courtyard - coffee, juice, bananas, yogurt, muffins, McDonalds apple pies,etc. We never had a problem finding parking. The staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs. Even before we arrived for our stay, we were notified that the motel and surrounding area would be out of power the night we were to arrive. Jess provided us with a flashlight when we arrived. It is so rare to find people who actually enjoy thier job. Well, it was obvious that these folks do. I think the friendly and relaxed atmosphere that the staff creates, causes thier patrons to be more friendly as well. Whenever, we'd pass through the courtyard, other patrons would say hello or good morning. You're lucky if other people even look at you in public these days! My only advice to future patrons would be to be ready for thin walls. The folks next to us were not especially loud, but we could hear them talking pretty clearly through the walls. We turned the AC/Heat unit in the room on \"fan\" and that helped alot. So, if you are a light sleeper bring earplugs or turn on that fan. Otherwise, the other patrons were very respectful of the \"9pm-9am quiet time.\" Thank you to the Dolphin for running such an affordable and pleasant establishment!

Budgets were not my main motivator when booking this motel, despite its very very reasonable rates, it was the trip advisor ratings that clinched the deal. My criteria for a hotel/motel is clean safe and friendly, im there to see the city NOT to sit in a room or by a pool (I can do that at my local leisure centre). The Dolphin had reviews by the page full stating my criteria would be hit, they utterly smashed it! From our first steps into the reception both my wife and myself knew this was going to be a great stay. To my discredit I forget the staff members names but suffice to say they will be the same ones that get talked about so positively in all the other reviews. These unsung staff members were fantastic, without being over the top, what I\u2019d call fake US hospitality. Nothing was a problem, not that we had any issues for them to solve. Vouchers for local attractions, deals at the local Mexican (DO NOT MISS IT) and all the maps you\u2019ll ever need were supplied without hesitation. The rooms, well\u2026.they are exactly as the web site says. Click on their home page, go to room pictures and only book if they meet your requirements. Anyone on here moaning about \u201csmall\u201d rooms in my opinion didn\u2019t do their homework and therefore their comments are null and void. They are spotlessly clean, comfortable and perfect for our needs, the needs being to SLEEP. Concerns about TV volume controls from other reviews seem odd to say the least, quite why people need to set up a home cinema experience while on holiday baffles me. We went to bed, watched the news at normal volumes, woke up and watched the news before breakfast what else could you need?? Perfect. The breakfast was as you would expect, please do EXPECT basic. Basic does not mean bad, it doesn\u2019t mean you start the day hungry but it does mean you\u2019re not getting the Vegas buffet style \u201cno need to eat for 3 days\u201d event. A muffin, a banana and an amazing cup of coffee (use the vanilla cream! \u2013 it always seemed to be hidden in the fridge) was the order of each day. If you need more there are options just over the road \u2013 just remember the price you paid for your room! My only comment that could be construed as slightly negative is the motels location from what us Brits would call the city centre. We didn\u2019t book a car and potentially that\u2019s our fault but we did assume that being the United States of America your public transport would \u201ckick our [--]\u201d it did not. The bus stop is a 20 second walk \u2013 perfect! The wait for a bus, hmmm not so great. In retro spec I would 100% recommend a car hire OR a fat wallet for a taxi, as the wait was just unbearable on occasions. The issue is exaggerated 100 fold come the evening. We liked to go out on the evenings to the Gaslamp area (check it out!!) but getting back was a nightmare whilst trying to use public transport. The trolly system is ok (ish) but come the end of the line your dumped in what seems like the middle of nowhere. All of this is NOTHING to do with the Motel, but I wouldn\u2019t want people to go to this great establishment and get disillusioned by the transport woes. To surmise, a epic motel that\u2019s clean, safe, friendly and supremely priced.

The reason to stay in this motel is the price. I stayed there this last weekend (Sept 2011) while attending a conference at the convention center downtown. I paid less for the three nights I stayed at the Dolphin than I would have paid for 3 nights in a hotel next to the convention center, especially when figuring in the free parking and free wi-fi at the Dolphin. The motel is very old and it shows it's age. All of the structural parts of the room and especially the bathroom look old. The room was very small. It had a queen bed with about 3 feet of clearance on each side, a nook for a closet, and a bathroom that was 3 by 4 with a shower (no tub) that was like 2 by 4. The carpet, bed, etc did look very clean. There was a new flat screen TV on the wall (27 inch I would guess) and two small night stands with two tiny lamps. No chairs (no room!), but they did provide two luggage racks, a tv tray and a mini fridge. There was also a very bright ceiling light that made it comfortable to read (in bed as it was the only place to be in the room). The room was very bright at night, I could have probably read with the lights off. I had to prop stuff up against the window to help shut out the light. he bottom floor room also had a lot of noise form the room above and the office next door. Breakfast is a tray of costco muffins, some bananas, coffee and OJ. The staff was very nice. It is 15 minutes of a very scenic drive to the convention center/Petco park, etc. There are lots and lots of restaurants within 3 or 4 blocks some of them fast food and some of them nice casual.

We were greeted by a very helpful, congenial fellow, Jeb who throughout our 3 night visit made it more memorable than the motel itself. Actually the motel was memorable in its simplicity, making you realize just what you do and don't need in your 'home away from home\" when traveling. The rooms are just big enough for a very comfortable bed, a folding chair, a big flat screen TV on the wall, a couple of small bedside tables with lamps, a small closet (no light which was a tad annoying to me) and your basic tiny bathroom, shower no tub but great water pressure (always a plus for my husband). There is a room AC which is fairly noisy when on. If you just want outside air and leave your window open, there is both street, other vacationers and sometimes airport noise. WiFi is free but my husband had trouble at times connecting his iPad. The folks at the desk at one point generously gave him the use of their laptop! You won't find all kinds of specialty bath items in the bathroom, such as lotions, shoe shine stuff etc. BUT if you forgot your toothpaste or run out (as I did) or need a straight razor or other toiletries or even a hair dryer, they have them for you at the office. The room comes with breakfast which consists of good coffee, hot water for tea and tea bags, Yoplait yoghurt in the fridge and when we were there, daily muffins - big and for me overly sweet. Since my husband and I are trying to watch our carbohydrate intake, we tried to find other places close by for breakfast, the closest being the one on Rosecrans connected to the Holiday Inn, I think it was. I think it was called the Point Loma Cafe. We had breakfast there 2 of our three mornings. It was adequate, a sort of glorified Denny's, not cheap but you could find all kinds of egg dishes and the portions were huge. The last morning we decided to find another place for breakfast which I would recommend highly. The Living Room Coffeehouse, 1018 Rosecrans. I think you could walk there but we drove. I will write a special review of this place because I want to give it 5 stars for the delicious food at an incredibly reasonable price. All this said, we went by the Ramada Inn next door to compare prices - twice as much, no breakfast whatsoever and probably pretty much the same type of rooms although we didn't look.

The room was immaculately clean, it was on the smaller size, but it had more than enough room for the two of us. The shower pressure was excellent. The daily breakfast of muffins, yogurt, juice and coffee was a nice start to the day. The staff at the motel are very friendly and helpful. Apparently, there are about two to three days of bad weather in San Diego a year...well we were there for all of them. The staff at the Dolphin Motel profusely apologized every time we saw them for the bad weather. It was adorable that they felt so bad about the weather during our visit. The older gentleman gave us an excellent recommendation of an incredibly beautiful drive back to Los Angeles through the mountains via the Sunrise Highway. This is highly recommended! We had already taken the PCH down to San Diego and wanted to see an alternate route. I will definitely come back to stay at the Dolphin Motel next time I am in San Diego.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "bougainvilleadesert", "ReviewID": "UR115759680", "Content": "Wonderful place to stay!

I was all set to only stay at the Dolphin one night with my brother and jump to the Half Moon or Holiday Inn. I was nervous because the reviews seemed too good to be true and the last thing I wanted was a creepy motel. But based on my fellow TripAdvisor reviewers I made a reservation for five nights at the Dolphin. We arrived late and our room was ready for us. Yes it was small but VERY clean. The bedding was all white, the AC worked well (take off the energy conserved button and the AC won't turn on and off all night) bathroom was small, clean and great water pressure and shower heads!! We were pretty impressed that this only costed us 70.00 a night. In the morning we walked out to the charming patio area where my brother poured a big cup of coffee, grabbed a banana and a yogurt and starting working from his computer using the free WiFi. I grabbed one of the two papers supplied in the breakfast area, took a big sigh of relief that the Dolphin was both relaxing, quiet and cheap. Steve from the front office came out every morning and poured me a cup of iced tea ....yes, he walked out and served me.....we met Holly, the owner, who greeted us by name every morning and asked if we needed directions or suggestions for where to eat or where to visit. We started in room 25 (main level)which had a twin for me and a full for my brother and Holly moved us after a few days to room 28 (second level) which has it's own patio and a full and a queen bed and a large window, (which 25 did not have) plus it's a corner room so I assume less noise though we really never heard any noise as we ran the AC all night. The bathrooms had soap in them but no shampoo though there are many places, including the front office, where shampoo can be bought. We asked Lin, who has cleaned rooms here at the Dolphin for over 30 years if she could give us a few towels to take to the beach. Lin delivered them ASAP and then asked everyday if we needed more. Rooms had refrigerators and a flat screen TV. The management here at the Dolphin is around 24 hours a day, parking is free and a quiet atphosphere is stressed. In the five night we were there we were NEVER bothered by noise. We slept great every night. My brother and I hated to leave as we did feel like family at the end. Save yourself 50-100 dollars a night and stay at the Dolphin. We will be back.

I have to say that after reading the reviews I had higher expectations for the hotel than what I ended up experiencing. There were many people to assist us when we arrived, and they were all very friendly and made sure to take steps to make us happy; however, I honestly feel that the room itself could be improved a bit. Probably one reason that they can charge so little is that they have not made as many efforts as they could to renovate the rooms. The shower was pretty nice, but the bathroom was very small- I guess I don't see how they could do much to change that. I was able to sleep pretty well on the bed, but the mattress pad or something made it feel kind of \"papery,\" if that is a word. The room was not impeccably clean as some of the reviews have said- I found random hairs scattered around the room in the corners, on the ledges, etc. I have been to similarly priced motels where the room was cleaner upon arrival. I feel that this is something that can be controlled while still charging a nice affordable price, and I would also recommend some renovations in the near future- especially the carpeting. The carpeting was very worn, & didn't quite go all the way to the wall (kind of curled up on the edges). It is kind of a pleasant little hotel/nice location, but I have to agree with the review that someone previously wrote- \"You get what you pay for.\" \"Average\" is not \"bad\"- it is \"average,\" and that is how I am rating this hotel.

If you are looking for a family run, friendly staff, great location, and GREAT owners, this place is for you. Where can you stay and actually get to talk to the owners on a daily basis? We stayed here for 6 nights to visit the San Diego Zoo, Legoland, Disneyland, local beaches, and local attractions. We actually didn't know who ran the chain until the 2nd morning of our stay because all the staff members are so helpful and friendly. They are always asking if everything was ok and if we needed to find somewhere to go for shopping, dining, or attractions to visit. Summary of how friendly the staff and owners were: 1) We left our shampoo at home and they allowed us to have some for free without charging us. 2) We also left our hair dryer at home and they supplied one for us. 3) No matter where we wanted to go, the staff and owners were always able to answer our questions or take the time to show us on a map or draw on a map. 4) The father and son (owners) always made us feel at home like it was a bed and breakfast at the beach!!! They were particular in entertaining our 4 year old son. 5) Breakfast is FREE - Daily bananas, muffins, and yogurt with coffee or orange juice. 6) Last and best, our flight back to North Carolina was not scheduled to depart until 10:50 PST, which is 1:50 AM EST. So we asked the owner (father) if we could check out later than 12 pm since our son naps still. They allowed us to check out at 3 pm vs. 12 pm so our son could get a nap FREE OF CHARGE!!!!!!. The only reason why I gave 1 less than the 5 stars for service was the house cleaning does just a little later than normal. And the only reason for the 1 less than the full 5 stars for sleep quality, was due to the one of the beds being harder than our home bed. But again, this is personal preference. We were not surprised by the room size as the pictures clearly show the size but it was just enough for the three of us. The rooms are always clean and kept up very well.

I stayed at the Dolphin because it was the cheapest motel near the landing, and because it was the closest motel to the landing. Both of these facts remain true... I moved to San Diego a year ago because I am an avid long-range fisherman. Every time I embark on a fishing trip, the day before the trip I stay at the Dolphin. First, I don't want a driving nightmare in the morning as I try to make it to the dock in time to plant my tackle box near the front of the line (get the best location for tackle on the boat). Second, I can leisurely stroll to and from the dock as boats come in, and check out the catch, say hello to other fishermen leaving on my trip (or similar trips) the next day, check out the local tackle shops--there are about a dozen of them, and they are some of the best-equipped in the world. The famous bar, Captain's Quarters--where all the fishermen and crew hang out, both before and after a trip--is about 150 feet away. Shelter Island is where the headliner musical groups show, and it is a fun moderate walk from the Dolphin, as is the second-best view of the downtown--out on Shelter Island. Downtown, Cabrillo (the BEST view of San Diego), America's Cup Harbor, Balboa Park (maybe a dozen attractions there), old town, Mission Bay, Ocean Beach (remember the volleyball scene in Top Gun)--location, location, location... My favorite reason to stay at the Dolphin is that it is, literally, the closest motel to the docks. They have available a convenient hand cart than I use to move heavy stuff effortlessly across Scott street. The parking is a blessing: lit, wide, 24/7 real-time video surveillance, on-site. No worries about leaving $25000 worth of gear in the car. The house staff have been on payroll for decades (no tipping, no worries)--it is family run, Holly and Allyn are well-known, well-respected and like old-school true locals. The staff, Steve, John, Steven are the seasoned vets, are professional real people. The rooms are comfortable and clean. There is no wasted space, but plenty of room for plenty of gear. I once stayed in a 2-bed unit, with 700 pounds of fishing gear, and two computers set-up as a network, for two weeks as my apartment was being readied for my move-in. There is free coffee and the best muffin I've found in Point Loma every morning--perfect for the trips back and forth to use the bathroom while waiting for the boat to load (we usually go to the dock at 4 AM for a noon departure, to get a good place in line).

And they said it's fine and that they would help us with it. (: We were lucky to arrive on 4th July, so we asked the owner where is the best place to view the fireworks. He told us where it was and drew a map to show us the exact location. Indeed it turned out to be a really great view and we watched 3 to 4 simultaneous fireworks! On top of that, we spoke to 2 ladies and they said they drove all the way there just to watch the fireworks. For us, we just have to walk a distance from where Dolphin Motel is. The next day, the owner recommended where to have breakfast and even drove us there because we weren't sure of how to make our way there. The breakfast was indeed a gd one. He also drove us to the National Cabrillo Monument and that saved us alot of trouble and time on navigating our way around. The view is so AWESOME anyone who goes to San Diego has to go there! The staff were extremely helpful and provided us with alot of tips on how to get around and which places we can go to with the limited time left in our stay. On our final day before checking out, the owner once again drove us to Shelter Island because we were pressed for time but wanted to visit a place before leaving beautiful San Diego. The owner and staff of Dolphin Motel have indeed gone the extra mile to make our stay an extremely pleasant, comfortable and fuss-free one.

This time we wanted to try a location in Point Loma for a number of good reasons. After considering several options (most of the Pt. Loma properties are clustered close together) we opted to try the Dolphin based mainly on price and TripAdvisor reviews. We drove in after dark on I-8 and turned onto Nimitz Ave. at the end of the freeway which brought us right to the Dolphin. Our reservation was accepted and we checked in without problem. Our room was on the second floor which was fine. On first impression we were a bit surprised at the compactness of the room which reminded me of some I had stayed in throughout the UK. Apart from that the room was clean to an acceptable standard and everything that was in it worked accordingly. The place has a kind of '70's feel to it which we have experienced at other SoCal accomodations! We found that the Dolphin was a combination of several pluses and a couple of minuses. The pluses included being situated in Pt. Loma which is a self contained community with most amenities within easy walking distance of the Dolphin. There is a great selection of restaurants, C stores, laundromat, gas stations etc. nearby and the streets are safe to walk after dark. In many ways it resembles most large towns that you would find on the Great Plains with that same \"Howdy neighbour\" friendliness. Pt. Loma is also strategically located in SD to provide quick access to all of the local attractions. We found that having wi-fi was a great convenience as we packed the laptop along. Morning coffee,OJ, and muffins are served in the outdoor courtyard which is very nice on warm sunny mornings. As many other commenters have mentioned the staff and management are very nice folks. The minuses were few and rather petty. The hotel doesn't have a pool (one is located beside the office but belongs to the neighbouring Comfort Inn.) The hotel advertises itself as being on a quiet street (Garrison) which is technically correct, however it is sandwiched between two very busy streets (Rosecrans and Scott). My wife likes to sleep with the windows open and the early morning traffic was very noticeable. The street traffic can be overcome by closing the windows and turning on the circulating fan. Another irritant was the vibrating roar of fighter jets taking off from North Island late in the evening. The snug rooms are fine for sleeping but don't expect to entertain guests.

This attracted me to it instantly - it was a no BS approach, and they didn't let themselves down. Having never been to San Diego before, I was unsure of the location, but once we were settled, we found it very easy to get anywhere we needed to go; and the added assistance of the front desk staff and particularly the owner who provided basic but effective hand drawn maps and easy to follow directions. However, I would suggest that if you wish to explore wider San Diego, then a car is a necessity. The rooms are quite small, but well appointed for the price, and the beds are extremely comfortable with crisp white linen. The bathrooms are tight, but the shower has the best water pressure of any hotel I have ever stayed at. The clientele of the hotel appear to be mainly people using the harbour for fishing or diving trips, and given they are up quite early in the morning, do not expect a sleep in, as the central courtyard area can get quite noisy. The complimentary continental breakfast provided consists of muffins & coffee, and is a welcome start to the day, however, those after a substantial breakfast will need to jump in the car and find a cafe or diner. Car parking is free as well, and there are plenty of spaces available. They are very clear about no-smoking in the rooms ($100 fine), yet they are happy for guests to smoke in the courtyard area, except for cigars, which we were told off for smoking. Go figure. Overall, this small but well maintained motel is a great place to stay if you are not too fussed about not having the little luxuries - ie, they only provide soap and no shampoo or conditioner, although they do offer these items for a nominal fee at the front desk.

Point Loma Seafoods, long known for its fresh seafood is also just a block away. The Dolphin was probably built back in the 60's and still retains the nostalgic flavor. We were skeptical at first glance since most old motels have become run down and best forgotten. Not the Dolphin; Its been maintained to high standards of cleanliness. Our room was immaculately clean, easily proven by the overwhelming use of white color. The motel grounds were spotless. We never saw a cigarette butt or scrap of paper anywhere.

Hospitable and friendly, he took the time to familiarize us with the few details about the room, including the free DSL and WiFi access. He offered the use of a laptop computer if needed, but we had our own. The room is small and amenities are limited to the internet access and a small refrigerator.

The good news is the Dolphin is exactly what people say it is: inexpensive, no frills, small, clean, centrally located and a great value. We slept well (in the end unit on the second floor above the office). I did not see any reviews of the bathroom shower, but I'm going to give a special 5 star award to our shower which was an unexpected surprise. My wife and I are so used to \"water-saver\" fixtures that we've given up on getting a decent shower in any hotel. My wife was thrilled to have \"water pressure\" (and I do mean water pressure!) in the shower. Bravo, Dolphin! First time visitors should prepare themselves for some oddities that make the Dolphin what it is. As one reviewer mentioned, the reservation process is peculiar. You have to send a check to reserve the first night - then you can pay for the following night(s) with a credit card. I don't know why -- that's just the way it is. When we arrived at the Dolphin to check it out, our initial reaction was that it was an old TraveLodge motel that had been converted into a Mom and Pop. The huge neon sign and drive-up office with racks of keys, weight scale and video surveillance is off-putting -- like you've entered some sort of alternate motel universe. My wife's initial apprehension was not lessened by a visit to the one of the motel rooms - it was spartan small, with home-made nightstands, and brilliant high gloss white paint that could be wiped clean with 409 or windex. I assured her repeatedly that it was okay - that ALL those good folks at TripAdvisor wouldn't lead us astray (would they?) Reluctantly, she agreed to let me reserve the room. How bad could it be, I figured? When we arrived this past Memorial Day weekend, the weather was drab and overcast. We were planning on taking a dip in the pool and sunning ourselves, but the weather was too cold. Nevertheless, we decided to check the water temperature by taking a walk down to the pool. Unfortunately, we couldn't find the entry gate. We soon learned from the desk clerk that the pool that sits out in front of the motel doesn't belong to the Dolphin, but to the motel next door. My wife told me she would not have been happy if the weather had been sunny and hot and she couldn't go swimming. Be forewarned! That pretty pool with the lawn out front belongs to the other guys! That complaint aside, we slept incredibly well on a firm queen mattress. Our room was very quiet and spotless. On a cleanliness note, the white bed comforter was pristine clean - to underscore the Dolphin's obsession with white, white, white. The air-conditioning unit worked well and shielded some outside noise. Also, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony outside our room earlier that evening with a cocktail, watching the sailboats across the street at the marina. On a related note, the video surveillance cameras that surround the property and the highly visible desk staff probably discourage potential visitors who think that the Dolphin would be a great place to drink and party all night. Our neighbors were quiet and courteous, as was the staff and owner whose primary concern appears to be maintaining quality at reasonable prices.

First of all, it is definitely not the best motel in San Diego. I have no idea how it got such a high rating here on trip advisor...price I suppose.

The rooms are pretty clean. The management is very friendly and accomodating. I had a couple problems with noise and they were very accomodating in switching me rooms and also telling some noisy people to quiet down after hours - and since there's 24 hour desk service, there's always someone to complain to about noise issues. Which brings us to the negative: the noise. If you're a noise sensitive person, you may have some problems. The walls are paper thin, as are the ceilings. During the week, things were not so bad, but not so much on the weekends or when the place is full. If you *are* noise-sensitive and you insist on staying here, I would at the very least recommend that you request a 2nd floor room, preferably at one of the ends of the motel. The other negative is that the rooms are indeed very small as some people have already mentioned. This may not be a big deal if you're not going to be in your room much anyway, but it really is probably the smallest motel/hotel room I've ever been in.

(We were prepared for it based on some previous reviews, however.) We were told we could guarantee the room by check or take our chances that the room would be available if we arrived after 6:00 PM. I decided to wait and talk it over with the significant other. She and I agreed \u2013 on THREE things: that there was no reason to send a check; that we would probably get there before 6:00 PM and that there would be no harm if the room was resold. We would simply find a room elsewhere. When I called back we went through this all again. I explained we would take our chances with the room not being available if we arrived after 6:00 pm. Then they asked for a cell phone number. I wasn\u2019t expecting that and as I am a little protective of the cell number I stated I didn\u2019t want to provide it. This started another round of unnecessary discussion. They seemed unsure if they could reserve the room without the cell phone number. The Dolphin representative then handed the phone over to another rep. We went through the scenario yet again and quickly came to the conclusion that it would be fine for me to reserve a room and take a chance that it would be available if we arrived after 6:00 pm. This seemed a very long route to get to the point where we could actually make a reservation. If the rankings weren\u2019t so stellar, I would have quickly looked elsewhere.

I highly recommend this place for non-luxury travellers.", "Date": "September 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected\u201d", "Author": "LBJ123", "ReviewID": "UR5563538", "Content": "After a lot of research, this was the ONLY place I could find for under $150/night in coastal SD (barring the Super 8's in Fashion Valley and that sort of thing). I read the motel reviews here - including the ones about its former life as a \"no tell motel\" - and took the plunge. I swore if it was a great place I would post here. So THANK YOU to those who've left reviews previously, and I hope this is helpful to other folks searching for a good place to stay. The Dolphin is literally across the street from the sport fishing marina in Point Loma and close to cute little places to grab a drink or some food. Otherwise, if you're a tourist, there is not much in the way of major sightseeing to be done in the immediate vicinity. Still, it's 5-10 minutes from area freeways; 15 minutes from downtown or 20 to Del Mar. The motel itself is a little worn around the edges, but well-cared for: very clean, absolutely no complaints. Awesome neon on the motel as well. Bare basic ammentities (shower, mini fridge, TV, air conditioning, bed, zero else [you wouldn't've been able to fit it in, anyway]). Room was teeny tiny but comfortable. We had one with a mirror at the head of the bed, a remnant from days of yore I spose, and we had a good chuckle over that one. Mornings there's coffee and donuts in the \"courtyard.\" The men who run the place were a little gruff but very good to us, supplying us with maps and recommendations as asked. We felt very safe and well taken care of. Overall I 100% recommend The Dolphin Motel for budget or adventuresome travelers; this would be a great homebase if you're a sport fishing fan, or want something slightly off the beaten path and the peace/quiet that offers, or just want to stay somewhere thrifty and a tiny bit funky (good funky, not bad funky). I stayed for a \"romantic getaway\" - and no, not for the mirrors - and we had a great time. If you're looking for something with a chain hotel vibe and amentities, or are traveling with a family (or a bunch of people in one room): look elsewhere, there's lots of other stuff nearby. But I will DEFINITELY be back to The Dolphin!", "Date": "August 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Az", "Title": "\u201cDolphin Motel, San Diego Ca\u201d", "Author": "MJJ", "ReviewID": "UR5513066", "Content": "Very Clean, helpful and nice office staff, walls thin, could hear snoring neighbor.

This kind man alone is reason enough to stay. For example: On day 2, my visa card was jammed by my bank in the UK (always let your bank know when you go abroad!!!), leaving me without cash temporarily (my parents sent me some through western union) and the owner offered to loan me some money to get some food. Like I said, a wonderful man! The rooms were lovely. Extremely clean, wonderful beds with great bathrooms attached, soft towels etc. The Dolphin also had free DSL and cable TV with many channels, a fridge, and some of the rooms had lovely views of the harbor. I could not fault the Dolphin in anyway, and as far as value for money goes, I invite people to try to find better. It cost about $50 a night and was worth far more than that.
