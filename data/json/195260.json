The Hotel really scores because of its location, which is just 5 minutes from the top the Ramblas and within easy reach of the central attractions such as the Gaudi buildings. As other reviewers have mentioned, it serves a good buffet breakfast in a pleasant Catalan dining room with a small terrace if there in the summer.

The hotel was easy to find and dead close to the Catalunya Metro Station. On check in we were given a friendly welcome and a photocopied set of instructions for avoiding pickpockets and thieves as well as some useful general advice from the receptionist. Service was friendly but our room was disappointing - small and very hot. The room looked onto an internal light well and was mostly dark. The bathroom had no window or ventilation and a single flourescent light. The minibar was surpisingly reasonably priced (2 Euro for a can of San Miguel, 1.5 Euro for a bottle of water) and there was a vending machine on the ground floor. The depressing room was ok for a three night trip but we'd have struggled if we were there for longer, it certainly wasn't the sort of place where you'd want to chill out. Also the acoustics of the lightwell meant that if someone was talking loudly at the bottom, it sounded like they were sat next door to you. Breakfast was ok - there was a lot of it and service was friendly but coffee was from a machine and the milk was UHT. We ended up nipping to the starbucks nearby to get coffee with fresh milk. What was amazing about this hotel was where it was only a few minutes walk from the Ramblas and Catalunya. We also walked up Passeig de Gracia to Casa Batllo one morning and it only tool about 15 minutes. We were also happy walking back at night. We'd read a lot about pickpockets and muggings but we didn't once feel uncomfortable, although it wasn't at the height of the season. There was no safe in our room so for 5 Euros we rented a safebox from the hotel and left our passports in that.

The hotel is generally well placed for a few days in the city; the area itself is quite studenty with a number of universtiy buildings adjacent to the hotel. It is very old fashioned, in a sort of Spanish country style, lots of dark wood, carvings of figures, on the stairs old coaching prints etc and doesn't look like it has changed much since the 60's but all clean, tidy and well maintained. There is a lift and each floor is set out in a similar way with a small lounge sitting area which provide a good meeting point if there are a few of you travelling. I found the staff to be efficient, not over friendly but you just need to make a bit of an effort and they will geneally do the same, If you are North American or British you shouldn't Interpret the rather brusque manner as rudeness or hostillity it is simply appears to be the Catalan way. Breakfast is served in the dated but quite pleasant dining rooom on the first floor, usual buffet style, nothing to write home about but adequate and plentiful. No other meals available in the hotel and althought there is a bar it never opened. On arival my partner and I were given a small double room with en-suite at the centre of the hotel, the window opened up on to a cental well which was incredibly noisy at all times. I could hear other guest talking, water draining from baths, toilets being flushed and what sounded like building rubble being sent down a chute except that this noise continued all through the night. If we closed the window it was too hot so a sleepless first night was had. Next morning I asked to be moved and we were moved to a larger twin room at the front, Now we got the crowds on the street, the skate boarders who seem to like the area at the front of the hotel at 2 am, the person clog dancing upstairs the man tickling his daughter next door and in the early hours of the morning the refuse collectors doing their thing. In a city centre hotel you expect some noise but it was excessive here, largely down to inadequate sound proofing, for three nights I managed only a few hours sleep despite going out and buying earplugs.

After our transfer from the airport late evening, we were greeted in a polite and prompt fashion at the desk, where they checked our passports and gave us some leaflets on personal safety and security in Barcelona, which helped us to be more aware of the risks of pickpockets (which we already were weary about). Our room at first was a twin, but after asking back down at reception they easily changed us to another double bedroom (I suppose it was easier due to low season). There are individual safes by the desk, which you can get a key for your stay for 5 euros. We made sure to always put valuables there whenever we were out of the room, and carried little with us out in the city. The room had a comfy bed, nice original features and a functional bathroom with shower/bath, just what we expected. The breakfast was a very nice continental one, and there was plenty of cereal, pastries, meat/cheese and fruit on offer, so we definitely didn't go hungry. Our room did not back on to anyone else's, but at points you could hear other people in their rooms and at one point someone snoring coming from a different floor! But to be honest this was not too much of a problem. View was not so good, just opened out into a kind of \"shaft\". Air conditioning was good, if a little noisy to sleep with, but again not a big problem. I left here with a great sense of satisfaction in that I feel I got real value for money here.

Both roads meet at a corner having a Starbucks with outside tables. Across the road from the Starbucks is the narrow Carrer de Jovellanis (signed). Go down that and take the first right (Carrer dels Tallers, flagstones not tarmac). Turn left into Calle de Valldonzella (tarmac) and the Meson Castilla is 50 metres on the left.

The advertised terrace is only accessible during breakfast time! Although rooms are air conditioned, the hotel switches the AC off from 9-1am during the morning which causes inconvenience if you happen to be in the hotel at those times. The Hotel is also situated down a back street leading to the Ramblas, during the daytime this street is busy but during the evening it is quiet and i would advise not to wander down this street alone. We woud have overlooked all of the above if we had customer service, but the staff were very unfriendly, very rarely greeted us, even on leaving they never said bye or i hope you enjoyed your stay...I would never reccomend this hotel, CUSTOMER SERVICE is important whether its a 2 star or 5 star hotel.

Whilst I agree with other reviews that this hotel is very clean and the breakfast is adequate I would warn people of the location. It is worth noting that before we checked in we were handed a leaflet on personal safety and to be wary of handbag thieves. We had been warned and I have stayed in Barcelona previously . None the less, that evening my friend and I were mugged and my friend's bag was stolen. In the struggle I was knocked to the ground and sustained substantial injuries to my face. This all happend literally around the corner of the hotel. One of the problems with the hotel is that there is no bar or place to buy coffee. There is a coffee machine at reception but this is not ideal. I doubt if we would have gone out late in the evening had there been a bar in the hotel . I have noted that in some websites that is lists a bar at this hotel but we did not see one. Two other members of the group had a similar experience the next day at a cash machine on the Ramblas. I would advise anyone, if they must go to Barcelona to stay on a main street and avoid hotels in side streets. The police are less than helpful. It took three attempts to get them to take a report and on the last occasion, it was due to a nice young policeman that took pity on us. It's seem that you must talk to the police through an official interpreter if you don't speak the language, and waiting for one takes forever. It's pointless really as the police will do nothing about the crime anyway. If you need to,try to report to the tourist police. (I was informed of this later). The police would like to blame 'other' nationalites for the spate of handbag snatching but it both incidents they were young well dressed spanish/catalan youths. The authorities do not take this crime seriously. It's seems to be very much accepted. I know too many that suffered similar fates in Barcelona.

Other than this (don't head out alone at night), it was difficult to find fault. The rooms had everything you needed except tea/coffe making facilities and the brekkie was great with something for everyone.

The bath was very small so I don't think most people could lie down fully streached in it. The breakfast was basic but it had a variety of cereals (including muesli and cornflakes), 2 different types of pastries (which changed each day) and 3 different types of bread and rolls (including bread you could use to make your own toast). They had both ordinary milk (hot and cold) and Soya milk. As previously mentioned they have a left luggage facility and safes available off the reception area. They ask for a 25 Euro deposit to use the safe but you get it back when you return the key All of the hotel staff were all very friendly and were able to offer good advice when asked. If you're traveling by foot from Placa Catalunya, one of the easiest ways to get to the the hotel is going down the Rambas and take the first street on the right after Pelai which is called Tallers. At the end of Tallers on tthe left you will come to Valldoncella (its can be called Valldonzella on street signs/ maps) and near the start of the street you will see the hotel (th street is before Placa Castella).

Do not go to any restaurants on the ramblas they are out to rip you off and when asked for tapas IE patatas bravas they were not, and they do not offer glasses of wine only by the bottle. Try off the ramblas and back streets. Wine very cheap and the supermarket called carrefour on the ramblas is fab. Hardrock cafe a must for people who only want chips burgers etc, however a good atmosphere. Macdoanlds and Kfc are better in spain than england, but I do prefer spanish food.

Located on a side street close to Placa Catalunya and Placa Universitat, and a hundred yards from La Rambla, this hotel is ideally located for touring the old town. The building is very olde worlde, with a very nice first floor dining room and patio. Some rooms have small balconies overlooking the street or internal courtyards, and most bedrooms are en suite. We found the hotel and our room to be comfortable, and the reception staff to be reasonably helpful, though not especially friendly. Our room had a small TV, although apart from BBC World and Sky News, most channels were Spanish or Catalan. We had two fairly minor quibbles. First, the noise. Our room overlooked Carrer Valdonzella, and the noise was intrusive until the early hours of the morning. If this is of concern, it would be best to ask for an inward facing room. Second, whilst the breakfast was adequate, it was hardly inspiring, with a rather limited and unchanging choice. The immediate area (northern Raval) is rather run down, with graffiti all over the place. However this adds to the genuine character and charm of the area.

The hotel is only a few minutes walk to La Rambla so is very well located. I had asked for a triple room but got a twin room with an extra camp bed. The camp bed was actually comfortable but the room was a little cramped. The bathroom was a decent size. Overall the room was basic but clean. The hotel has six floors but the lift only goes to the 5th floor. Our room was on the 6th floor so we had to drag ourselves and our suitcases up two flights of stairs. Not a problem if you are fit and healthy but if you have any kind of back problem I\u2019d get another room. Fortunately there are only 2 rooms on the 6th floor. The lift is small and can just about hold 3 people with their suitcases. The hotel offers breakfast until 11am which is great but often there wasn\u2019t much food out on the buffet table after 10.00am. Staff will replenish if you ask them to do but you need to ask as they don\u2019t seem to check food supplies themselves. Breakfast was just ok. It consisted of orange juice (straight from the largest catering can I have ever seen), toast, various breads, cereal, yoghurt and fruit. Also some strange looking cold (processed) meat which I avoided. The staff were very quiet in manner and there weren\u2019t that many smiles on offer so I can see why other reviewers might have perceived them to be a little \u2018miserable\u2019. That aside, I found them helpful when I needed assistance. The hotel has a 24 hour front-desk so arriving late at night is not a problem.
