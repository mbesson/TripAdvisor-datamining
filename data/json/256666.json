I arrived on a late flight but checking in at 11pm was no problem. Reception and night porter staff were very helpful during my two night stay on business. Rooms were big for Sydney, clean. Although they is no breakfast onsite I found the Breakfast on the Go package in the fridge very useful. For a few dollars you get fruit, cereal, milk and pastry in a neat fresh pack. Great idea! Price of mini bar was not too expensive. Good experience all round and good for business or holiday. My only one gripe is the free Internet I was given. It is not worth it. The free wifi internet was very slow and only good for reading emails. You wouldn't be able to watch anything with any multimedia content like youtube or tv streams. I ended up using my 4G mobile Internet from Telstra.

I had been monitoring Trip Advisor religiously, and worried because of some of the reivews. They were either glowing, or really terrible. After staying at The York, I assume that the apartments are all privately owned, and some may be better than others. Ours certainly exceeded our expectations. We stayed in a deluxe executive suite on the 22nd floor. The main reason we decided to stay here was because, with 2 teenage boys, most hotels would offer 2 queen beds in a room (they don't want to share a bed!), or interconnecting rooms (double the price). A serviced apartment was certainly a better move. We entered the apartment and straight ahead was the living room, to the left was a bedroom for the boys, and to the right (down a short hall) was the master bedroom. The master bedroom had a large ensuite next to it, with a double sink, bath, shower and loo. Next to that was a laundry with washing machine and dryer. Other reviews have said appliances were noisy, however this was not the case in this particular room. Walking forward from the front door, you pass the 2nd bathroom on the right, and walk into the main living area. It has a full kitchen with appliances (toaster, saucepans etc). A large L shaped couch with TV. To the right of the living room is a rectangle table with 6 chairs. A little further to the right, behind sliding doors, is an office with desk, chair and couch. The kids room had its own veranda with table and 4 chairs, where we had breaky! The living room had a veranda with a table and 2 chairs. We had a lovely view of Lavender Bay. There were certainly buildings in the way, but, hey, it's the city. At night it was lovely. Friday afternoon we walked to Darling Harbour and had lunch, then that night we walked down to the bridge and did the climb. Saturday, we walked down to the market at the Rocks and then to Circular Quay to catch a ferry to Pyrmont, the monorail around and walked back to the unit. It was a great location and gave us the opportunity to visit many sites without need for a car. After each trip out, we enjoyed a swim in the beautiful pool on the 6th floor, and soaked in the spa. There was also a sauna and gym. We would recommend this apartment to friends and family, but perhaps suggest they stay in that particular unit or at least book the deluxe executive. I believe the executive all face the front of the building. On the down side...I would be careful with little kids. The verandas do have pot plants and chairs. You can lock the sliding doors, but there are not locks up high, so you would need to be vigilant. Again, this was in this particular unit, others may be different.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cDid the job\u201d", "Author": "goingawayy", "ReviewID": "UR124699982", "Content": "I stayed here in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment with 2 girlfriends start of feb (2012) for 4 nights.I found it to be fairly big and the bathrooms were nice. the main bedroom was very big and the 2nd was abit small but you're only really in there for sleeping so that was fine.

When we spoke to reception we were told there were no deluxe apartments available and the offer was only available 'if' there was availability. We persisted, and finally were told we could move to a deluxe apartment for our second night - gee, how kind! We would most definitely NOT have booked this hotel if it were not for the upgrade and I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay in the un-refurbished rooms. As someone else has said in their review, the fridge (which is in the room) is so noisy it keeps you awake, as does the loud 'Ding Dong' every time the lift arrives! The light switches and sockets are so dirty you don't want to touch them, and I don't think anyone has ever cleaned the skirting boards which are black with dust etc. In both apartments holes had been punched in doors and then filled and shabbily painted. On the plus side(!), the location is good - just 10 mins walk to The Rocks and The Wharf. And the pool looked clean and inviting, though we didn't get time to use it.

The only two negatives were the lack of any mini-bar price list (illegal?:), which was somewhat self defeating for the management as rather than having a nasty shock, we simply bought everything we needed from Coles AND the ridiculous prices for internet access - this led us to simply using the free access at Starbucks and on the ferries. Again, a huge black mark to management for their scroogeness.

There was no way we could find the entrance to the parking tower or anywhere to even stand by to get down and check in for our access card. And so we paid for parking on the street to approach the reception. We stayed on the 6th floor and noises from the streets were still heard.

From a location point of view, this place is perfect. It's literally a 5min walk to The Opera House, Harbour Bridge, Circular Quay and the Pitt St Mall and perhaps a 10 minute walk to Darling Harbour and Chinatown. We were travelling with a small child and pushing a pram too so it's definitely easy to get around. The room itself was clean and tidy with modern furnishings and was very spacious. Some of the areas looked a little tired, but only if you are really wanting to be a critic would you notice this. The well functioning kitchen was appreciated! The lounge room had a large plasma and although a new lounge is definitely needed as it is rock hard (room 1104 if anyone is interested!) it is a very comfy space. The laundry is one of the small, tucked in behind a cupboard jobs, but with a washing machine, dryer and sink it was perfect for what we needed. A small clothesline would have been nice though. The laundry is located within the bathroom which is also a nice size and had plenty of steaming hot water! The toilet is separate with it's own sink which i give bonus points for!!! The balcony offered impressive views of the city even though we couldn't quite see the harbour (it didn't worry us). The little one loved running around out here and watching all the traffic and it was nice to have somewhere to sit outside with a glass of wine and people watch! The bedroom was a tight squeeze with a porta-cot included but without that it would have been spacious. There is another TV in here which is great. There were plenty of pillows to choose from and even though it was freezing, the blankets were toasty warm and smelt clean (not dusty like lots of other places!) I assumed the rooms wouldn't be serviced daily, but we received a top-up of tea, coffee, sugar etc each day as well as clean towels. The only negative of the place, which has been blogged about many times before, is the traffic noise. The door from the balcony into our bedroom, although locked, didn't quite close properly and you could definitely hear the noise. Even if this did close properly i doubt it would have made that much difference. Whilst it wasn't overwhelmingly loud, it's not the place to stay if you want a nice sleep in.

It was spacious. It was well equipped. We had a good sized balcony with nice city views - we even had a sliver of harbour view from the balcony! Yes it was noisy, even with the doors/windows closed. If that is a concern for you then I'm sure there are many apartments in Sydney that have better sound insulation. Internally it was very quiet. What let it down for us was the room servicing. At best it was inconsistent: some days they replaced tea/coffee supplies other days they did not; some days they replaced flannels/towels and other days they left us short while on others days they left more than we needed. At worst the place was dirty. On the day we moved in we found pieces of food and an elastic band beneath the desk. In the whole of the 2 weeks we were there the tiled floors in the kitchen area and bathroom were not mopped once. I don't think the carpet was vaccumed once either. There were two noticeable stains on the pale beige carpet that I'm sure could have been removed if someone had tried - I was almost tempetd to have a go myself. If you removed the seats on the soaf there was food and other detrius underneath. And surfaces were left to gather dust. See our pictures. Basically the room servicing people did the absolute minimum, which is a shame as in all other respects the place was good. A minor thing - we found the reception staff a bit aloof.

The location is brilliant: within walking distance of the Circular Quay, The Rocks neighborhood, the Opera House, the Botanical Gardens, and just 3 minutes from Wynyard Station. The two Asian restaurants at street level serve high quality sushi and noodles and there is a Starbucks just a block away ( no free internet there either) for you coffee addicts. The view from our covered terrace on the 22nd floor was stunning and we ate meals there every day. The booking staff took extra effort to help us reserve reservations two months in advance for the famous New Year's Eve fireworks show. Their advice was spot-on perfect. Once you get used to the quirks, and don't have the expectation of impressing anyone, you will enjoy the many pleasures of Sydney.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, spacious living quarters\u201d", "Author": "mmandavis", "ReviewID": "UR92619407", "Content": "I stayed in Sydney for the new year and had just come from a week in Melbourne after staying in a serviced apartment at the Medina Grand. I was blown away by how much more spacious than the Medina the York apartment was. We had a 2 bedroom unrefurbished executive apartment. It was really spacious. It had 3 balconies. We were in unit 90. While it did not have a view of the bridge for the fireworks, it did have a nice view of the harbor. I liked the open floor plan. It had another room with a couch and desk that could be used as a third bedroom. It came in handy one night when my husband started snoring. While the room may have been weathered as some reviewers stated, eg., the carpet was worn and bathroom had some wear and tear with rust, it was clean. It wasn't so worn as to render it uncomfortable. The room service was at times sporadic but it was the new year. The staff was friendly. The pool area was clean but one time there were no more clean towels so when I called they said someone would come up or I could come down to the front desk. I was lazy and didn't go down but no one came up. What I am saying is it is a serviced apartment. It's not the same as staying in a hotel. So don't have those expectations. I would definitely stay there again. Great location, within walking distance to the best area, the Rocks. Down the block from the Wynyard Station. So take the train from the airport. A Starbucks is down the block. A grocery story is a block and half away. Also in the train station area, there are plenty of places to buy food or have lunch or breakfast. I found as an american, the food in restaurants to be very expensive, especially now that our dollar is worth less than the Australian dollar. So being in a good location is key so you are close enough to eat in your apartment. We tried one of the noodle japanese restaurants just outside the York and it was good but not cheap, then again nothing was. We had a running joke that in Australia where Subway shops are plentiful, you don't get the $5 footlong but instead the $9 footlong. We were on the 16th floor and I don't understand the complaints about the noise. What do you expect when you stay in the city. It's air conditioned so if you shut the windows and doors, it is not loud at all.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kingston", "Title": "\u201cGood place for NYE\u201d", "Author": "PPDc", "ReviewID": "UR92375021", "Content": "Stayed at the York for NYE 2010. Wasn't sure about the serviced apartment style but finding a reasonably priced room is quite difficult in Sydney for the New Year. Check-in was simple. Stayed on a 7th floor studio. The room was quite spacious and clean. It had a balcony with a sitting table but we only had a view of the office building in front of us. Left the balcony door open once or twice to turn the A/C off - there is a lot of road noise. We found the kitchen fully equipped and functional, we had breakfast in the room every morning after stocking up at a nearby supermarket. There is no divide between the kitchen and the bedroom so the noise of the fridge compressor was noticeable at night. The bathroom was also large and functional. In general, the room was comfortable for a 5 night stay (and I am fairly picky). It is listed as 4 star (probably by Aussie standards) yet it would be 3 star in most places. Some aspects of the room could be updated (closets, washer/ dryer, radio) but none were any major issue. Location is a major plus. If you don't mind walking you can get to most of the tourist sites in 10-15 minutes. Walked to Darling Harbour for a NYE cruise with the wife in heels with no issue. Circular Quay, the Rocks, the Opera house and shopping on George and Pitt street are also short walks. There is no hotel restaurant/ bar but it wasn't an issue. The Japanese restaurant in the same building was good quality an price. Loads of eating choices within a short walk. There is a small gym and pool area was small but well done, although it doesn't get sunlight all through the day.

What they don't disclose before charging you is their hyperinflated conversion and banking charge that ended up costing me an additional 6% of my total bill, plus, when asked if they could cancel this since they never fully disclosed the nature of the charge, they said that was fine, then charged me again in Australian dollars only to find that once I returned home to the states, they cancelled the Australian dollar charge and not the US dollar charge.

No problems with the kitchen amenities too. But that's where the honeymoon ends. The internet was a very pricey A$30 a day for unlimited use, although there was a weekly plan for A$125 (make sure you ask at the reception if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying that long). I had small quibbles such as not having a sponge to wash utensils and crockery, although oddly enough, dishwashing liquid was provided. A box of complimentary washing powder was promised at the time of booking but the front desk insisted that washing powder was chargeable from the first box onwards. Anyway, all these minor annoyances would have been easily forgiven if not for the following episodes with the washer. The nightmare began in earnest about 3 days into my stay when the staff had the washer in my apartment replaced. Somehow they thought it best to keep the guest in the dark about this matter. Unfortunately for myself, I had been piling up my soiled laundry in the old washer, and the maintenance staff did not even bother to check if there were any clothes inside before replacing the washer! Imagine my shock when I returned that night around 10pm to find all my clothes missing. I actually thought that someone had broken into the room before thinking that housekeeping might have sent the clothes for laundry service by mistake. In trying to query housekeeping at that moment, it was then that I discovered that housekeeping had gone home for the day \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so housekeeping, and also maintenance, are both not available 24/7. Anyway, the gentleman at the front desk finally managed to locate my clothes in the old washer which had been sent to some storage area. The case of the disappearing clothes is apparently the mystery-thriller that you get for A$215 a night. Never mind. A couple of days later, the simple act of using the washer turned out to have a rather complicated ending. All was well until the final spin cycle when the washer began spinning so violently that it sounded like a train roaring through the entire apartment. Worst of all, it started making a horrible metallic clacking noise and I was so worried that something was going to explode and send shrapnel flying around the bathroom. And then BOOM! A deathly silence ensued. When I steeled my nerves to peek into the bathroom, I found the dryer, which had been stacked on the washer, on the bathroom floor instead, lying on its side. The dryer had unplugged itself from the electrical socket and the plastic casing around its door had fallen out. It was like a scene from an earthquake zone. My colleague was completely speechless at the utter devastation in the bathroom. Needless to say, maintenance had knocked off for the day because it was already past 10pm. So there was nothing they could do until the following morning. What irked me even more was that the staff had the gall to suggest that I had overloaded the washer [It was only half full]. To cut a long story short, they promised to look into fixing the washer. I was probably a fool to have taken them at their word, because a few nights later, the same thing happened again when I tried washing my clothes a second time. This time, I deliberately reduced the washing load to just 2 pairs of jeans, and I took the additional precaution of lowering the machine spin rate. When I was woken up by another loud crash of the dryer in the bathroom, I knew then that the washer was beyond the point of redemption, and so was my impression of the York. My concluding advice is this: If you have a weak heart, or if you have a history of hypertension, or simply just looking for someplace that is value-for-money, the York is probably not the place for you.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cSpacious, central and affordable apartments\u201d", "Author": "aboutandout", "ReviewID": "UR25556470", "Content": "Location is fantastic in the CBD.

Our apartment had a balcony where you could enjoy a pre-dinner drink and watch the traffic going on and off the expressway. Traffic noise wasn't an issue at night, but we were fairly high up. There was also a washing machine and dryer in the apartment which was unexpected and useful. A huge bonus for this hotel is its proximity to Wynyard station. We flew into Sydney and instead of taxis, caught the train from the airport to Wynyard - it was then a very short walk to the Hotel. Also in the Wynyard station is a Coles Supermarket. It took me a while to locate it, but it is definitely there. We were able to stock up on breakfast ingredients and thus save more money. We had a lot of trouble finding a bottle shop nearby, but eventually located CBD Cellars in Carrington Street which sits down behind the bus area opposite Wynyard Station (about 5 minutes walk). The Room was well serviced and the staff on the front desk were very helpful and friendly. We arrived about an hour before check-in time, but were advised our room was ready and waiting for us.

There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the tower was built in the 1970s and has a hideous, boring brown colour reminiscent of many of the high-rise buildings of that time. Secondly, we had seen a couple of bad reviews on TripAdvisor and we were sceptical about the place. We had booked the two bedroom apartment in the Deluxe Category for a decent price, considering it was the Australia Day long weekend. Upon entering the room, we found that it had been fully renovated and all of the appliances and furnishings were quite new. The apartment was spacious and tastefully decorated, with clean bathrooms and large balconies. This was a positive start. Another good point about this hotel was that with each apartment you book, you receive a free, secure undercover parking space. The car park is tight and somewhat confusing (because of the RESERVED signs that are placed in front of 90% of the spaces), but for a free spot so close to Circular Quay we can't complain. While the York is close to the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge, it is at least a 20-30 minute walk to Darling Harbour and the Aquarium. Because we have already seen all of the major attractions in Darling Harbour, and because we normally drive to Sydney, I would most probably stay here again. For an overseas tourist however, they may consider staying somewhere more Central (ie somewhere in between Circular Quay and Darling Harbour).", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sunshine Coast", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "LouiseSunshineCoast", "ReviewID": "UR18766669", "Content": "We stayed at the York Hotel for a long weekend and had a wonderful time.

The pool and sauna were in a lovely setting and even in slightly cool weather it was worth a dip.

The location is great as it's only minutes on foot from the QVB and city centre, Darling Harbour and of course, Circular Quay. Wynyard tube is only yards away which connects with trains going all over Sydney and there's also a Coles supermarket there which makes doing a food shop easy. When we arrived from our London flight at 10.30am we assumed we'd not be able to check in as it was still early, but actually the room was already ready for us and we were immediately made welcome by the really friendly staff. When booking the apartment we'd asked for a high quiet room (because we'd read some of the comments here about road noise etc). This is exactly what we got - and more! Our room was on the top floor and had brilliant panoramic views of the harbour - from Darling Harbour round to Luna Park and the Harbour bridge. Although we could see the bridge traffic, noise was never a problem and at night the city lights if anything made the view more impressive. Our room was very modern and clean and although we'd booked a one bedroom, it was actually a two bed with one closed off. There were two bathrooms to choose from and a brand new kitchen fitted with Miele appliances - we never were without the necessary utensils/glasses/plates etc either. The bedroom was large and all the rooms had quiet air-con. There were two balconies although only one was really suitable for sitting out on. However be aware that this apartment is very high up and some may find it a bit scary to go out and actually see how high up they really are. While the York isn't the cheapest place to stay (especially at New Year when we stayed there) it is worth it if your can afford it. We didn't have time to visit the pool or the gym, but found the rest of the hotel matched the quality of our apartment. The staff were always very polite and helpful and we even had a Christmas card and present thanking us for 'making do' on Christmas day so the cleaning staff could have a day off! All in all it's certainly somewhere we'd stay again. We've stayed at the Rendezvous Stafford and thought that was good, but if you can afford that little bit extra then stay here because it's definitely worth it.", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Emeryville, California", "Title": "\u201cNear Perfect Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "bobolo", "ReviewID": "UR17124752", "Content": "The York Apartment Hotel is a near perfect place to stay in Sydney.

The ensuite was well equipped with a nice large shower that worked well - not just a dribble of water! Both bathrooms came complete with the usual shampoo and shower gel, nice thick flannels and large clean towels. The 2nd bedroom had twin beds and equally as comfortable. The staff - especially the porter - Micha I think his name was, was extremely hellpful in every way, as were all the reception staff. The kitchen was well equipped with all cutlery and cockery for up to 6 pax, a large fridge, electric hob, microwave (I think it had) and a welcome pack consisting of water, a small carton of milk (I think) sugar etc... . In the kitchen there was a sliding french door onto a huge balcony which housed a table and 4 chairs. From the master bedroom there was another huge balcony complete with BBQ facilities which we didn't get a chance to use. The lounge too was large with a few sofas, tv, phone , and a lovely dining table large enough for a dinner party! The decor overall was a bit 70's and dated in cream and brown colours- but that didn't matter at all. We were on the 22nd floor - eek!! see photos! I have to say that our apartment was excellent in every way, close to all the sights - bridge, opera house, the Rocks etc and can highly recommend it for a few days (or longer) whilst in Sydney - be it for business or pleasure.

My only real beef was with the staff, who were not rude per se, but also not terribly pleasant or helpful either. You should especially be very very careful before signing your credit card slip at the check-out. They showed me my bill, which I examined and said it was fine. Subsequently they took my credit card to run it through, handed me the slip and in one breath, asked me to sign. Thankfully, by some divine intervention, I looked at the amount just before signing it, only to discover to my horror that it was $600 OVER the amount that was on my final bill! The young lady at the desk did not even apologize when I pointed it out to her. She simply said, \"Oh, let me change that for you\". Meanwhile I could partly see her co-worker/supervisor in the background watching and listening to what was going on. I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was not intentional or an organized plot. All I'm saying is, be careful, and review all charges and totals before you sign.
