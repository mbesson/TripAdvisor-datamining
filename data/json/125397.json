It is a trendy hotel similar to a W hotel. We liked the fact it was right downtown and got us out of the usual Orlando resort hotel. Many restaurants were within walking distance and it was an easy drive just off I-4. It took us about 20 minutes to Universal Studios and 30 to Disney. The service was good, but some of the staff was not always friendly. The valet and bellhop guys were the friendliest and very helpful. Our car was always there promptly when we went downstairs and they would close all the doors for us and graciously welcome us back. The room service was tasty. We ended up dining in our room two nights and we thought everything was good and reasonably priced. We did not have a good experience at the restaurant, however, on our first night and do not recommend it to anyone. The service was lousy and rude and extremely slow. See me related review of The Boheme. We traveled with our two children, ages 8 and 11, and it may not have been the best choice for a family.

The pool was a little cool and the sun wasn't out for long but then again it is February! Had Sunday (jazz) brunch in the restaurant which was decadent, and sumptious - the price was a little high however it included unlimited mimosas & some items of the ala carte menu (though those portions were rather small). We also had a few drinks in the bar during happy hour which was definitely well worth the price. Don't be surprised to see NBA stars staying in the hotel as the Magic play so close to the hotel and other celebs who may be performing close by. Downtown Orlando was pretty quiet but there are some delicious (Kres Chophouse, particularly) restaurants a VERY quick walk away on West Church Street and a Starbucks for that perfect pick-me up in the morning attached to the hotel. .

The area has seen better days & there are a lot of empty lots from building boom projects that never happened.

But The Bohemian is a little gilded world unto itself, with a giant bar/lounge done up like a New Orleans circus and a Sunday brunch that draws both guests & a diverse local crowd. My 18 year old daughter & I toured area colleges by day & then hung out at the hotel.

The rates at this hotel are really very competitive for a 4+ star hotel. Do your research and check the direct website for some really good AAA / etc rates. There is Valet Parking only. This isn't really a big deal. If you've been to Downtown Orlando with a car, then you know that you could be blocks and blocks away to get to the nearest public parking lot. It's a swanky place with a lovely entrance. Even when we take the uber-gas sensible Toyota Corolla; we still valet. It makes for a much nicer and smother entrance to the hotel I can assure you. Since the building is sort of a \"high rise\" and in the high rise area of Downtown, you have to kind of drive into the first floor. I only mention this because there are a lot of one way street in that area, so you could get turned around or not be able to figure out how to approach the valet entrance. It is really quite a discrete area to keep the hotel nice and clean looking. Just keep it in mind, it's not a huge deal. Once you get out of the car it's a few steps to the front door and about 3-4 steps to your reception area. All in all, I believe I've stayed at this hotel 15 times and not once have I received poor service checking in. The staff is very nice, knowledgeable and eager to assist you. After you've checked in, it's just a few more steps and you're at the elevators to take you to your floor. The layout of the hotel is pretty simple and easy to navigate to your room. You will see an outrageous amount \"real\" art that is for sale all over the walls. There is a very impressive body of works on display, so make sure you take your time to soak it all in if you're in art buff. Let's get to the rooms....nice, comfortable and great beds. That sums it up in 4 words. Now in more detail, we stayed in a one bedroom suite during our November stay. WOW! The regular rooms are quite lavish with excellent bathrooms and fantastic decor throughout the room. This was our first suite at the Grand Bohemian and boy oh boy...was it grand. Now, don't start envisioning the presidential suite at Cesar's Palace. It has a different layout than the normal rooms as it in on the rotunda corner of the building. This area is a fantasic spot for watch the TV, hanging out on the couch, sitting down to eat or just soak in the view and enjoy a book. The bathrooms are always elegant, but not overdone. Beds are so comfortable that I'd like to take one home. Attached pictures will give you an idea of how the room looks. A couple of last things to mention. The bar / lounge in the lobby often has a great jazz band on Saturday nights and can make for a nice romantic evening without leaving the hotel at all. It's rather lush with a huge focus on art in the decor, rather breathtaking at times. There is also a fabulous restaurant on site, however I can't remember the name. I've only eaten there for Sunday Brunch and it's.......mouth watering. This was the first place I've ever had roasted Smoked Applewood Bacon cut to order, sinfully delicious. If you are able to book a reservation for any of the major holidays like mothers or fathers day...book it. It's probably going to run you in the range of $50 per person, however it's worth every penny. Often times the price of the brunch is inclusive of champagne or even wine. So, in some ways, it's a pretty good value for the money. There IS a pool. I can't remember what floor it's on (maybe 7). It's a nice little lap pool with spitting lion heads into it. There are excellent quality loungers on the deck, a hot tub and quite a fancy shmancy tented area with tables underneath it. I would assume it's a function area, but it was really nice with fantastic chandeliers hanging inside and all. There is a fitness and spa...I've not had the pleasure of using either. All in all, this is one of my favorite hotels in Orlando. If you have to be close to or anywhere north of Downtown, then stay here.

Website stated 'Continental Breakfast, afternoon tea, hors d'oeuvres, cocktails for a fee, staffed from 5:30 - 9:30 p.m., all day free snacks - water - soda'. The breakfast was okay - fruits, oatmeal, individual seriously overcooked quiches, etc. There was NO afternoon tea. The hors d'oeuvres were GONE by 6:00 p.m., napkins were gone, no diet sodas and several other items were already depleted. The small club room was mobbed and one woman was working the tiny bar.

There were 4 or 5 bottles of water, several each of ginger ale, club soda, lemon-lime, etc. in the small refrigerator. That's the extent of the 'free' items. TIP: Bring your own bottled water because the bottled waters in your room are $5. TIP: Don't even touch anything in the mini-bar, because it's electronic and will charge you if you just pick it up to look at it! (Tell the desk and they'll remove the charge, if it happens.)

I need to send a big thank you to one of the concierge Christine(I think that's her name), When my husband and I were thinking of where to have dinner one night, he mentioned to her that he wanted grouper. She called approximately 10 restaurants looking to see if they had it on the menu. She called us to tell us that one restaurant had 10 remaining. She definitely went above and beyond for us. We eventually had dinner in the hotel restaurant. Besides unfortunately having to listen to some stuffed shirt in a suit trying to get something for nothing, our dinner was absolutely amazing. The food, wine, service was exceptional. Our room was very quiet even though the hotel was full. We overlooked the pool and never heard a single noise. Only one small issue: We chose the breakfast package and weren't given the vouchers at check in or explained how it worked until we were at breakfast the next day. No big deal, just a little inconvenient. One suggestion to Management, charging $22/day to park and $10/day for internet is a little ridiculous.

The pool service was also lacking - there was a server taking drink orders and after being at the pool for 2 hours, we were never approached by her once (and we really wanted to get our drink on - it was my BIRTHDAY, after all!).

Based on our experiences in Orlando we were looking forward to this hotel that is promoted as very chic and part of the Marriott \"Autograph\" collection. We are big Marriott fans, but this place was a total letdown. We stayed on the 12th floor of the hotel. Our room had several spots of paint missing on the wall, a large black scuff mark on the wall as you walked in and very old and moldy rugs. My allergies really kicked in! Vacationing there during 95 degree heat and humidity I was stunned to find no fan in the bathroom. Terrible! Although the roomy is large, it was very shabby. The chair to the desk had three rips on the seat cushion. The \"art\" on the wall reminded me of the haunted mansion at Hollywood Studies. Everything in the hotel requires your room key, from the business center, to the pool, to the bathroom to using the elevator. Clearly there are safety issues with the area the hotel is located in. Although they promote themselves as a key conference location, they offer no complimentary shuttle service. The price for a cab is about $44 and a limo price is about $95. One of the real stunners was to find that if you move a drink or remove a drink from the fridge there is a sensor that automatically charges your room tab....whether you drink it or NOT. The fridge was lukewarm. I think the hotel really needs to step up. The few staff I saw around the dirty pool area were hiding on the side smoking. And, the pool...or should I say wading pool. It definitely is heated....so hot we couldn't swim. No worries though, we physically could not swim as the deepest area of the pool was 3 ft 6 inch with about 6-8 inches of water missing. Really, this can't be Marriott's best go of it. We'd never return. Although we did venture out and about, the half hour we were outside we were approached by two pan-handlers.

I doubt there is anything that can be done in AUGUST in Orlando! The issues I had though were mainly customer service: 1) When I called to see when the bar at the pool was open, the front desk informed me \"They don't really have a schedule. or at least not one they give to us.\" Odd. 2) I stayed for 4 nights. The first night we were awakened by an alarm going off in the room next door (alarm clock) at 5 AM. I called security who came up and shut it off. It happened again the next night. My friend called security and said this was the second time this had happened. It was shut off promptly. The third night it happened again, and I called downstairs, furious that they had simply been turning it off without TURNING IT OFF. That afternoon I asked the front desk to send someone up and sure enough, it was all set to happen again the next day. Unusual. 3) Upon check in, we were given a newsletter with an internet access code and informing us about the concierge lounge, \"available to all\" (was written verbatim in the newsletter). WHen we tried to visit it, our keys did not work and the front desk scolded us in front of other customers.. saying she'd let us in.. but it was very expensive.. and as they aren't really Marriott they can't honor these things. Being honest: I don't think I had enough points to qualify for the lounge, but given that I had been offered it, and it was in the paper they gave me, she made me feel like I owed her my firstborn for getting access and it was just condescending and incredibly rude. She should have just said no rather than schooling me in a public lobby adn telling me what a screw up her colleague was that had checked me in. The first rule of customer service is not to insult your colleagues, I thought. 4) The last night we headed downstairs for drinks only to see the lobby bar tented and loud renovations happening. I thought it was customary to be infomed upon checkin about these things happening. 5) We had the usual runaround with the minibar/stuff had accidentally been moved/the bar's electrical system was broken. The charges were removed promptly but not after being on hold for 15 minutes. In short, we had a lovely time. I would absolutely stay here again, but I would know to expect Courtyard Marriott customer service, not a four diamond property.

To begin with, the service is beyond exceptional at this hotel. Everyone, from the bellboy to the concierge to the housekeeping staff to the waitstaff at the restaurant, was more than kind and accommodating to our every need. A perfect example of the service provided by the staff at this hotel happened during our first night at the hotel. During dinner at the restaurant, one of the chefs actually came out to our table to clarify a special menu request I had. Aside from the quiet and romantic ambience at the restaurant, the food is wonderful as well!! The room we stayed in during our wedding weekend last year were very nice, but it was a suite with a jacuzzi tub in the room, so of course it would be nicer than a regular room! This weekend, in our regular room, I was not as impressed as I was with the suite. This room had some hairs on the floor around the toilet area, and the air conditioning in the room never seemed to get cool enough. We were on the top floor of the hotel, and it was a very hot weekend, but I would expect the room to be cooler. The thermostat had no way to be read, so we never knew what the temperature was in our room. The rest of that floor felt about the same temperature, but down on the first and fifth floor it was much cooler. Lastly, I want to talk about my visit to the spa. Being pregnant, I had some special requests during my visit, and I must say that I was highly impressed. I've had facials, massages, and prenatal massages all over the country, and I'd rank this massage and facial at the top of my list. My spa esthetician was Rhonda. She did an excellent job and I have never felt more relaxed! Another plus of this hotel is its location. It is within a few blocks (about 5-10 minutes walking) of many great restaurants, a huge movie theater, nightclubs and bars, and other entertainment.

It seems as though it was airport food it was cold (been stored in the refrigerator), the bread was not toasted and fries were cold. The chefs salad was dismal, it came with no dressing, and wasn't worth calling back for. I can't imagine they would have made a \"fresh\" one, just another from the fridge. The key lime pie (mind you we are in Florida) was awful. Not fresh, not tasty, and just bad. I always stay positive, but for $42, I am appalled.

I was ready to give the hotel a perfect score, but then I had an incident with my bill that upset me very greatly and was ready to downgrade the score. After letting a little time pass, I got over the extreme anger and was able to objectively give the hotel very high marks. First, I will go over the many good points. The hotel is located right downtown and is in walking distance to a number of bars and restaurants. The lobby is wonderfully appointed. The hotel has a tremendous \"art\" theme on every single floor and even has its own gallery. The art work was great throughout the whole hotel including the rooms. The front desk staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I had a king bed room and it was plenty large with a pretty large bathroom as well. The bathroom had dual shower-heads. The room had a large flat screen TV and a CD of cool music playing when I walked in. The bed was very comfortable. There was a large, extended sitting chair. The concierge lounge was very nicely appointed and the snacks/breakfast were just fine. The outdoor pool area was very nice on the 6th floor of the hotel and the fitness room was nice as well with ellipticals, treadmills, nautilus and free weights. The valet brought cars quickly. Now for the very few \"bad\" things. A relatively minor issue was that the air conditioning temperature control was one of those old style controls with no digital display and you just put in on cool with hi or low fan. Even with it on cool and \"hi\", it was not cool enough in the room for my taste. Such a nice hotel should have a more modern temperature control. The real \"bad\" thing was looking at my bill in the morning. I was extremely surprised to see charge after charge after charge after charge for perhaps 15 items from the mini-bar. I did not consume a single item from the mini-bar. The only thing I had done was take out two waters from the minibar and put in two small diet coke bottles for the night. I replaced the waters in the morning. After I got the bill, I went back and noticed for the first time a small sticker on the door of the minibar indicating that items would be charged automatically when removed. As indicated, all I removed were the water bottles. In the process, I had knocked over some beer bottles inside the minibar and simply straightened them out right away. They never left the cooler. Yet, they were all still on this bill. This \"automatic\" billing minibar has to be one of the worst pieces of hotel technology I have ever seen. It clearly did not work right. I have to believe the hotel has received many, many complaints about it. Their \"stated\" purpose of not having items removed to store other items is understandable, but the technology just doesn't work right and caused me much grief and anger. I called the front desk. They did quickly agree to remove the items, but I have not seen my adjusted bill yet to verify it was done. I didn't need that hassle. So, with the exception of those few things, the hotel was great!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hartley Wintney, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cTry the Courtyard at lake lucern\u201d", "Author": "RobAiers", "ReviewID": "UR115295101", "Content": "I have to say as a seasoned world traveler how disappointing and expensive my 1 night stay was at the \"Grand\" Bohemian.

We dreaded the long trip by car because in previous stays, also for business, all we remembered was the terrible traffic in that area and the lack of activities that interested us. Finding this hotel on the Marriott website made it easy to get a room, and our trip was memorable for the right reasons this time. The Room While my husband attended a meeting in downtown Orlando, we stayed in room 720, a large corner suite, on Wednesday and Thursday nights earlier this month. Throughout this art-themed hotel, the walls are covered with interesting pieces of art , and the colors of the furnishings add to the artsy decor. The light brown walls and heavy purple drapes and furniture were quite pleasant in our room, which was very well laid out with a large living room for working and watching TV. (See photo) As bright and sunny as it usually in Orlando, closing the thick curtains and dimming the light should provide a respite from the summer heat. The only downsides in the room were that it was a bit dark at night and we could not remove items from the minibar fridge and cool the foods we preferred, such as Diet Dr. Pepper and yogurt. (So we left them in our ice chest and just changed the ice twice a day.) The king bed was pleasantly comfortable considering we sleep on a Tempurpedic foam mattress at home. There is a lot of typical city noise outside\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6sirens, cars, trains, etc., because you are in the middle of a city. So it is a transition for us coming from a very quiet neighborhood where the major sounds are loud birds squawking in the backyard. But the thick drapes help insulate from the city noise as does the i-Pod music player. And we always carry something to help us sleep in big cities. Breakfast in the Upstairs Lounge The food was tasty and well displayed in the small lounge, which was too crowded at times to get a table. The servers were first class, and the atmosphere was relaxing. We also enjoyed visiting the Lounge in the evening. The Pool and Gym It was too windy to use the lovely outdoor pool (see photo) with a beautiful cabana and you guessed it, more outstanding sculpture! In good weather, this would be a nice place to park yourself and a friend for a relaxing day. The gyn looked just okay, but I was too busy beading to use it. The Value We normally spend under $120. per night for business travel rooms at various Marriott properties; this hotel provided good value and a first class experience. After searching a bit online, we took the lowest available rate on Marriott\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s site and paid $200. per night plus tax. Weekend nights appear to be more expensive. It was wonderful receiving Marriott points for our stay because that is why we can take long vacations in countries where there are Marriotts. Also the letter welcoming us to the hotel was a nice touch, but they really butchered my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strange name even though our reservation was made through Marriott online with the correct spelling. The Art Wow! We loved looking at the art gallery and paintings throughout the hotel. We understand that the owner ran out of wall space and home and had to build a hotel to house the rest of his collection. In an hour of gawking and taking photos of the art, I managed to view less than half of the walls before getting dizzy, or should I say high on art! There are very few art-themed hotels, especially of the 12 story size. We stayed in the art-themed Renaissance Arts in New Orleans just before Katrina and enjoyed being surrounded by art there as well. It is wonderful that original artists have a built in audience in rare hotels like this one. The gallery on the main floor offers many colorful works for sale. Restaurant The high point of our stay was dinner in the Bohemia restaurant on the main floor. Everything was perfect about the meal from the menus that were backlit to the crab ravioli and grilled romaine lettuce. Nanna from Armenia was our server, and she did a first class job meeting our needs. The prices were reasonable considering the quality of everything, and it was easy spending the evening in the hotel after being out all day. It was fun before entering the restaurant to listen to the Bosendorfer piano being played so passionately. (There is a second Bosendorfer upstairs between the meeting rooms.) We did not stop in the bar for a drink, but it looked inviting as well. Many folks have told us that the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Sunday buffet is outstanding. Very Minor Issues We really enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel. Our main complaint was that when we called enroute from Daytona, the hotel operator gave us the wrong exit off of I-4, and there is no such thing. Exit 83 was closed, so that was no help. We had to drive around a bit to find the place after taking the next exit. Our GPS was not in the rental car with us, and there was not time to find the exit on my iPhone after we realized the exit they gave us was wrong. Also the letter welcoming us to the hotel was a nice touch, but they really butchered my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s strange name even though our reservation was made through Marriott online with the correct spelling. What to do in the Orlando area The last day of our stay, I drove just a few miles from downtown Orlando to Winter Park, the home of the Morse Museum, which houses the largest collection of Louis Tiffany work. This place is a must see especially after February 2011 when their new addition is complete. We have seen Tiffany pieces in many museums all over, but none have such quality and breadth. The gift shop offers a great selection of art books and Motawi tile. This museum is at the top of our list when we return to Orlando. For lunch there are plenty of fine restaurants in the downtown area. We did not have time to see the museum at Rollins College nor the Henry Leu Gardens, but will check see them on our return. If you enjoy making beaded items, there is a wonderful shop, the Bead Bar, a few miles from the hotel. If you are driving from the Daytona area, you can also stop at Imagine That!, my favorite US bead store, just east of I-95 in Ormond Beach. Beading is a wonderful way to relax while on vacation, and you end up having some nice, custom jewelry to wear home. Just beware that your friends will demand that you make jewelry for them as well! Summary We will return to this hotel when we return to Orlando. We despise most things related to theme parks, and this hotel allowed us to forget that Disney is/was Orlando. The hotel makes you feel as if you are in a grown up city, not one that focuses on fun for the kids.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Florida", "Title": "\u201cEclectic, fun, artsy!\u201d", "Author": "sunshine34467", "ReviewID": "UR82662491", "Content": "Great hotel.

Relax by the awesome pool, hang out in the bar or enjoy surprising nightlife nearby. It is well worth the short drive and easy to get to. In my view this is Orlando's finest hotel at any price and I have stayed at several. It is the anti-Disney. Let me share one experience to give you a sense of how the staff performs. I called down to inquire about where I could get a New York Times. The concierge was apologetic that no more were available, they only had Wall Street Journal's left, but offered to go across the lobby to the adjoining Starbucks to see if they had them. I told her that wasn't necessary, that I was going to grab a coffee later anyway and thanked her for the information. I did go to Starbucks's and they did have the paper. I stopped by the concierge on my way up to the pool to grab one of the WSJ's she mentioned and there on the corner of the desk was a NYT with my name on it. When she realized that I had in fact purchased one, she apologized for my trouble and without hesitation went to petty cash and reimbursed me for it. WOW. This hotel understands that it truly is the little things and attention to detail that separate the wannabes from the real thing.

While our supply of coffee was refilled only 3 creamers were provided and no artificial sweetener was left for us (If we used it once don't you think we might use it again). It is certainly a minor thing but when I had to get dressed and go to the concierge lounge for cream and sweetener when I didn't want to... something minor becomes larger. One used glass was replaced and the other one left dirty behind the water filled ice bucket. I guess we didn't get a clean one because??? No big deal I can wash a glass but again, I didn't want to.

The \"welcome bags\" were never given out until the grooms mother asked about them an hour before the wedding.

After just a few people arrived at the people, it began to feel very crowded (and once one of them started smoking, it was impossible to avoid the smoke...a big deal to me, but it may not bother others). The space might be more comfortable if the canopy was smaller and the chairs were more spread out, but that would apparently interfere with events such as weddings. Which leads to THE WEDDING PLANNERS! I was already not feeling totally comfortable at the pool when a troupe of VERY loud, VERY obnoxious wedding planners showed up and began marching around the pool deck, shouting orders at each other, completely oblivious to the people trying to relax inches away (literally - one of them bumped my feet as she walked past, and didn't even acknowledge it).

Art work a bit tacky in my view. They charge you $1 on leaving to give to an art charity. You can have it removed, but I dislike hotels that are so presumptive that they want me to fund their pet charities. As many reviewers noted, I had only tepid water. I was here on a conference and most of the folks in my party were fine, so it must only be the rooms in a particular zone. They pretended it was a new problem when I told them. Obviously, a hotel trying to be 5 stars should have hot water. Rooms are fine. Beds comfortable and WIFI fast. Main complaint is the the rooms are very dark. Bathroom is bright though. Nice toileteries. My room was above South Orange (main street). There is a fire station a block and half away and so you can be waken up at odd hours depending on fires. They lost my laundry. I called them two hours after they delivered and response was valet delivered everything and cleaners were closed, but they would be on it first thing in the morning. (I was checking out at noon.) When I called in the morning they knew nothing about this. They did eventually manage to find my laundry in their basement. They said they would refund me if they coulodn\u00c2\u00b4t find my laundry but would deduct a depreciation charge for wear and tear of cloting first! I have never been in a hotel of this class that does this.

I was attending a small conference and the food they served us at lunch was very good. Staff looking after us were excellent.

We're from Michigan so we thought a weekend in Orlando would be a nice break from the cold weather, and we were right. Downtown Orlando isn't huge but I felt like the Grand Bohemian was right in the middle of everything - all the bars and restaurants and sites you need are within walking distance. The ambiance and decor of the Grand Bohemian lives up to it's name and to ones expectations - there is incredible artwork everywhere - including the hallways and in your room. The rooms are very nice, with comfortable beds, decorating that I would be happy to have in my home, and a big flat screen TV (great for watching the superbowl!). We stayed on the 6th floor, and that is where the fitness center and outdoor (wonderful) pool, hot tub and sitting area are located. It was great for us because we used the hot tub every day - it was a GREAT place to have a drink and relax while being surrounded by palm trees. However - and in my mind this is minor but I could see how some people wouldn't like this - our window faced the walkway that surrounded the pool (the pool was elevated so you couldn't see swimmers and they couldn't see you) and on that walkway were potted trees and tables and chairs. A few times I saw people walking right by my window, which was startling at first and you definitely need to be mindful of what you're wearing! BUT, again, this was minor, but be aware if you're checking in and they tell you you're on the 6th floor. I would suggest walking to the nearby markets to stock up on wine, beer and snacks, if you like those things - as I think the least expensive glass of wine on the bar menu was 10 bucks. The rooms were so nice, and the fact that they provide good wine glasses in your room made me happy to have a drink there before heading out to dinner. If you like brunch (and you don't mind paying 29 bucks) then you MUST have the brunch at the Grand Bohemian. Shrimp, eggs benedict, crab legs, ribs, and so much more - it was all fantastic!! Best of all, the mimosas were only 5 bucks each, a great deal. The bar area is again very classy, very nice, and they have a great jazz band on Saturday night. We saw a very interesting mix of people staying at the GB, anywhere from families, groups of single guys and girls out to party, to the entire Wizards basketball team. It has a wide appeal because it's a truly unique and fun place to be.

The Valet Parking is wonderful, which lead me to believe that the rest of my stay was going to be equally as great. I called the day before to verify the check in time, and to see if I could check in early. I was told 4 PM was check in time, and early check in would not be allowed. I arrived around 4:30, as the wedding I was attending started at 6. I was told that my room was not ready, and they did not have an estimate as to when it would be ready. As I needed to get ready for the wedding, I was offered the option of either a) the ladies room off the lobby or b) the bride's room as a place to change clothes. I chose option a, and along with another guest trying to check in, we both got ready in the in ladies room, with other guests attempting to use the facilities as well. I was told that I could cancel my reservation, and there would be no penalty AFTER the front desk had already swiped my debit card, thus putting a $ 250 hold on my checking account...with the knowledge that the \"hold\" would come in in 5-7 business days...as I had already been charged, I may as well stay anyway. I received a call, over 3 hours after I arrived that my room was available. They did offer to take my luggage to my room for me, and gave me a free drink for the hotel bar for my \"trouble\" and extended my check out time by 1 hour. The wedding was beautiful, but during the reception, there was a malfunction with the fire alarms so the reception was interrupted by flashing lights and a mechanical voice saying we had to leave. I received a voice mail in my room telling me that I had a gift bag waiting for me at the front desk (something the bride and groom left for all their guests staying at the hotel). When I went to check out, I was told that they had given all the bags back to the bride / groom, even though I had a message that there was one waiting. As of today, the actual charges for the room have been posted to my checking account, but there is still a hold for the initial authorization. This is a beautiful hotel, but the check in policies are all but ignored (unless you are a professional basketball player or celebrity...the rooms for them were ready)...the bride's mother could not check into her room when she arrived....and the customer service is lacking. The response when questioned that they had a full turn over between Thursday and Friday and they were not ready....housekeeping came to my room at 9:30 AM, so the explaination does not make sense...

My husband and I booked an overnight stay, Saturday, with reservations for the Jazz Brunch at the hotel restaurant, The Boheme, on Sunday to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Since our last overnight stay, three years ago, I have to say the hotel is as lovely as ever, but there are a few areas for improvement. WE paid $138 for a deluxe suite - very affordable for a downtown Orlando 4 1/2 star hotel. I appreciated the discounted price even more after observing a few dissappointents. The doorman and front desk representative were courteous and efficient upon check-in. I was not thrilled when I read a notice at the front desk stating we would not have access to the swimming pool from 10 AM - 3:00 PM and 4:30 PM - 6 PM. The hotel was having not just one special event, but two that day! Perhaps this is why our room was at such a good rate? Not ones to dwell on the negative, we proceeded to our room on the 8th floor with a view of the pool. The rooms are spacious with a bedroom and adjoining sitting area and very clean. We had a king bed with plush down bedding and down pillows, a flat screen TV, stocked refrigerator and snack bar, red velvet couch and a desk and chair. The bathroom is very nice with a marble floor, plush terry robes for two, and a double spa type shower head, large vanity and basic toiletries, shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion were Kessler's brand. My satisfaction with the room was diminished by the loud thump, thump, thump of the DJ playing top 40 music for the private party at the pool. (I am 44, my husband 51) We are not opposed to people having a good time, especially if they paid the higher rate for a special party, but c'mon!!! We heard the music as clearly as if were there partying with them. Apparently, management tried to keep a control on the sound level as it occassional was turned down, but minutes later was right back up again. So much for taking a nap while waiting for the pool and spa to be free. The bed was plush and comfortable. We enjoyed the Bose stereo and the compilation CD Kessler provides for their guests to play while visiting. If you like the CD enough you may take it home for $15.95. Unfortunately, we could not hear the TV or the stereo over the DJ until he left. At 3 PM we went down to the 6th floor to go to the pool and spa and the temperature of the water was heavenly. I was a bit disappointed by the appearance of the pool and spa, both need resurfacing as they are cracked and discolored from patching and wear and tear. In the meantime, the pool surface needs a good scrubbing. The pool lounge chairs are comfortable, but the ivory colored fabric is turning brown and should be replaced...ugh! I put several towels down as I didn't want to lay on dirty lounge chairs. Overall, the pool area needs a facelift. Although we did not have time to use the exercise equipment in the fitness center, it is very well set up with everything from weights to stair climbers and treadmills with flat screen TVs. They even provide complimentary headphones for their guests. There is not an actual spa on premise, but massage, facials and body treatments are available in room by appointment. We did order room service for lunch. The order was taken courteously and delivered within 30 minutes. Of course, the price was about $50 for lunch for two, but that is to be expected of room service in an upscale hotel. The unique theme of this hotel is Kessler's unusual collection of artwork in rooms and all common areas. There is something for people of all artistic tastes. The hotel possesses one of only two Bosendorfer pianos. On Friday and Saturday evenings, the hotel lounge is a popular place for a cocktail live jazz from 8 PM- 10:30 PM. My cocktail recommendation: The Pomegranite martini is delicious! My husband loves that Crown Royal Reserve is served here. The hotel is very clean throughout with one peculiar housekeeping oversight to mention. Many of the doors in the hotel require a good cleaning as they have fingerprints and other dirt on them. It was a strange oversight that I found on our room door, the bathroom door and on several doors in the common areas. We have frequented the hotel lounge of this artsy, eclectic hotel over the last six years and always have a good time. There was a wonderful love seat in the corner we found with a spacious marble coffee table. From here we could hear the jazz from the other room quite clearly and also do some people watching. The lounge also offers the full room service menu if you care to eat while enjoying a cocktail or two. We have enjoyed the Sunday Jazz Brunch before and enjoyed it just as well today. At $50 a person, it is pricey, but it is a unique brunch with live piano jazz, unlimited champagne and mimosas, shrimp, crab legs, sushi, and several signature meat dishes along with carved ham and new york strip. All in all, we had a fantastic week-end and will return in a year or so.

The hotel impresses the moment you pull up to valet parking - an elegant entry & foyer leading to a room that was as beautiful and well appointed as anything I have stayed in for <$200 per night. The impressive thing about the Grand Bo is it manages to avoid feeling like a hotel, or a chain for that matter. Lovely velour, wood and of course the beautiful original artwork really creates a special atmosphere. Location is perfect for downtown Orlando - you are right on Orange Ave where all the nightlife happens on the weekends, and I imagine for business activities during the week. Weekends were very quiet during the day but thats a typical American downtown for you - luckily a fine breakfast diner is located just a couple of blocks up on Park St. The negative ? Well having stayed largely in chains earlier in my stay - I got used to the niceties of your typical Hampton or Ramada - free fast internet, decent included breakfast, free parking, FF miles etc. I guess a hotel as upmarket as the Grand Bo can charge in spades for all these things (and not give any miles) because it is what it is - one of the finest & stylish hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at. An extra highlight being among the Cleveland Cavalier players during their stay for the NBA Eastern Conference finals of 2009 - I think also a testimony to the quality of the hotel.

(I had forgotten my cell phone in the unprepared rush to get out of the car) Everyone on the staff are extremely courteous and attentive to your needs. (interesting British accents with the room attendants) Tips are shown appreciation but not at all pressured everywhere. Even when I'm just waiting in the lounge near the bar, the bartender comes up and brings me water with a welcoming manner. Now the hotel feels narrow like most of the Orlando Downtown buildings, but the high celings and rich opulence of the place is very attractive. Maroon lighting, burgundy accents, and mahogany woods coupled with edgy artwork and jazz music nightly made the place feel so swanky. I put the cute black dress on cuz I felt really high class. I also felt very safe because you need to scan your active room key to get to any floor other than Lobby on the elevator. The room itself was very nice though traditionally narrow. However the accomadations were thoughtful. Starbucks coffee with mugs&to-go cups, great cucumber melon toiletries, very comfortable beds, robes, flat screen tv, great view of the pool. You merely need to ask for free neccessities like shoe polish, sewing kit, lint brush, detergent for handwash clothes. They'll provide maps for you and try to read your mind for your next need. I was impressed. However, internet is not free. I saw a few of the other amenities. The pool with whirlpool looked small but nice, located on the 5th floor. It was shadowed by a large permanent tent/pavillion that looked perfect for the wedding that took place the night we arrived. It is a great place to catch some sun because it has a great view of the city. I didn't see what the fitness center looked like. The gallery is just a small hallway but it had great original work featured from local and national artists. Truly the whole hotel is more the gallery because they saturate all the walls on all floors. Your room has at least 4 unique large printed canvas paintings. I looked into my husband's conference rooms and they were adequately sized with a large projector screens for lecture. The service is what it's all about. They provided really great food. Juices, fruit, hot breakfast. For lunch, they had wraps, clam chowder bisque, assorted cookies... just a ridiculous spread. Checking out was absolutely a dream. They gladly extended my check out to 1pm. It gave me time to walk around the city and look at Downtown clubs still slumbering and eateries quietly open on a Saturday late morning. When I had to check out, I still had to wait for my husband still at conference. When I wanted to put my bags in the car, that's when valet posed a slight problem. However, they were happy to put our luggage into \"storage\" which seemed very secure. I didn't worry about our expensive laptop in their hands. At $127/night, I was very impressed. A few tips with downtown: \"look very cute and sexy but high class:\" you'll find yourself wanting to look nice for the expensive restaurants (average$30-$40/plate a la carte but worth it!) and then compete with the half-dressed young girls trying to get people into the wild party clubs. \"No shopping\" Downtown Orlando is certainly a culture/club scene. Nothing else within walking distance. (The outlet malls of Orlando are actually very good if you go just before Christmas.) \"Good public transportation\" the free Lymmo is a nice, quick bus service that runs up and down the Downtown area (and stops closeby the GB!) However, it's really not a very long walk and if you want to appreciate the place, the blocks are very small. Also they keep the area clean, well kept, and safe. A whiff of sewer can be expected sometimes though. \"If you're a nerd like me, check out the library\" I walked by a large building that was actually the Orlando library. It was huge and so nice! Who would've thought an eating place would've been inside a library? \"Eat at the Breakfast Club:\" Located very close to the GB (front desk can give you a map) is a breakfast and lunch place that has reasonable prices. You can order sandwiches, omelettes, crepes to your heart's content. I ordered the Flamingo crepe, which was to die for. For $8, you get hashbrowns, 4 half-slices of large toast, and a sizeable crepe filled with fresh vegetables&cheese, fresh avocado, turkey and bacon pieces, and topped with sourcream and salsa. Soooo good! So this was a great short trip for greaat food, culture and music, and royal treatment. I hope you have a great trip to Downtown Orlando!", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "toronto", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel In Orlando A 5 Star Hotel With 5 Star Service!\u201d", "Author": "pengu1956", "ReviewID": "UR25799973", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Bohemian for 4 nights in February.

We ate in the hotel restaurant for dinner and breakfast, and the food was excellent. We also relaxed in the funky lounge one night, where there was great live jazz music playing. The lounge is equipped with a special piano (I can't remember the name) that I'm told is top of the line. Did I mention the artwork? There's incredible original artwork throughout the hotel. You could spend an entire weekend just looking at the artwork on every floor and every room of the hotel. It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in a hotel. As I stated before, the Grand Bohemian is a nice alternative to the hubbub of Disney. But the flip side is that there really is not much going on in downtown Orlando, and not much you can walk to. But there are some nice restaurants a short drive away in the Lake Eola area. The one area where I would say the Grand Bohemian is not five-star is in its service. There was nothing particularly bad about the service, but you certainly don't get the type of top-tier service you'd expect from a five-star hotel. It's nothing exceptional.

We were in Jacksonville with cabin fever and thought we would move south to Orlando to be closer to Miami. We were with a dog so had restrictions on where we couuld stay. The pricepoint was great, the hotel looked good on paper (their website was impressive) so we booked them. We could have got a rate for $140 for our room if we booked thru hotels.com, but you could not amend your trip after booking specific dates so we went with the higher rate of $190 (we ended up checking out two days early) which was good considering the hotel and what it offered. Valet was attentive, professional and very welcoming. Front desk, from what I could tell as I did not do the check in, was good. The room was spectacular. We had a view of the pool, sitting area, desk, and a king size bed. Based on previous reviews of this hotel (I did research it) we did also find the snack/mini bar strange with their \"remove it, you bought it\" policy. It offended my friend, but I guess I could understand as why do you have to touch a Snickers bar to see what it is? Only problem was, we had open cans of dog food that we couldn't make room for in the fridge out of fear of being charged for whatever we moved. Needs some work for guests with dogs or special needs of a fridge. We deposited the dog and wanted to grab lunch. I asked the concierge after we got to our room and left our dog in it and asked her where to go to eat. She directed us to a lunch place OUTSIDE of the hotel. My friend asked the front desk and referred us to the dining room and had a very good lunch. Staff was a tad overwhelmed as it is \"off season\" and staff was minimal. We also did breakfast in the dining room instead of the brunch, though I hear good things about the brunch. My one negative of our stay was the front desk. I feel they deserve their various Diamond Awards over the last 4 years. However, it didn't come from the front desk. I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons, and Peninsula Hotels. The front desk at these locations always acknowledge you on the way in or out of the hotel, especially on the way in, welcoming you back. We were acknowledged more by the valet/bellmen than the front desk staff. Everything else about the hotel says Mandarin, Four Seasons, except this aspect of the hotel. Also, when asking the front desk person what was in the area of the restaurant we were going to, she had no clue where it was or the restaurant we were going to. My experience is the front desk should have as good a knowledge of the area as the concierge, the same concierge that was telling us to go outside the hotel for lunch! Would stay here again in a heartbeat. I am not sure what their normal in-season rate would be, but I would return! Valet Parking price is normal for any city.

My husband even said when telling me about his \"surprise\", \"Well, its not the Four Seasons, but I know you always enjoy the G.B.\". After the luxury of 3 nights in NYC, I was pleasantly surprised that our stay at the G.B. was just as delightful as the Four Seasons. It did not seem like a 'let down\" in the slightest. The rooms are beautifully appointed, with a touch of whimsy. Very \"Moulin Rouge\". The mix of velvet, satin and tapestry is just lovely. The rooms are so large, the shower is luxurious, the bar downstairs is hip and a great stop for drinks and convo before heading out for dinner. The rooftop pool is super chic with its sleek furnishings, red pillows and chandeliers in the permanant tented lounge. We like to take the family to Disney just as much as the next family, but do yourself a favor and take a little getaway to O-town, sans children, and enjoy the fun city life, great restaurants of Thorton Park, boutique shopping of Winter Park, and fabulous stay at the Grand Bohemian!", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "triptracker01", "Title": "\u201cLoved this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "triptracker01", "ReviewID": "UR18473811", "Content": "We (my husband and myself) were in Orlando for business and stayed at the Grand Bohemian at the suggestion of the conference staff.

Need an eye checkup\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Property was OK. Staff was attentive and courteous. The atmosphere however; was dull and almost boring. We (my wife and I with 6-years-old-son) stayed in a king size bed with a sofa bed located on the 15th-floor concierge level. We had the swimming pool view which is located down on the 6th floor. Room was bit cramped and furniture worn-out. Room doesn't have a flat-screen wall-mounted TV but an old analog machine. Bathroom was clean but very ordinary. The bathroom amenities were three small bottles and single a sink. The shower did have two showerheads however; water-pressure was pretty weak. Friday night, they had a fashion show thus; pool usage was restricted to staying guests. People were smoking virtually everywhere. One of the perks of being on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153concierge\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd leave was usage of the exclusive lounge which servers breakfast and happy hours in the evening. The breakfast was pretty pathetic with fresh fruits, cereals, muffins and pancakes. There were no eggs and conventional bread. It was the same on Friday thru Sunday. We did go to the pool area and my son swam. He was happy. For grownups however; the pool is rather small, and less than 4 feet deep which doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t provide true swimming pleasure. Saturday night, the smoke alarm in our room went off. We all got up and left the room thinking that alarm was going off everywhere. We then returned and I called the front desk who sent a maintenance staff along with 2 security guards. The guy replaced the bettery and everyone apologized for the inconvenience.

There was not even a flat-screen TV which does not jibe with the image they are trying to portray. The TV cabinet was deep, and there was not much room between the cabinet and the foot of the bed. The hotel touts their art work, but the pictures in the room were cheap, dated prints. The bathroom was ordinary. No separate shower nor enclosed commode. Only 3 towels were provided. Very basic amenities. The soundproofing was inadequate. Not only could we hear groups of noisy people in the hallway at all hours, we could even hear the ice machine. They advertise they do not rent rooms to people under 21, but we encountered very young people in the elevator in sloppy clothes, carrying on loudly and drinking alcohol. We had a reservation at the dining room for 8 PM, but found it empty except for one couple. Thinking that was not a very promising sign, we decided to go elsewhere. The small pool area was closed for a private function. The function board indicated many more future private events at the pool, depriving the hotel guest of an expected amenity. As JAXTRVLR mentioned, the car entry is very awkward and congested. The hotel does not compare to the Kessler property in Savannah. It is more a typical 2 1/2 or 3* business hotel. At over $200, we did not feel it was worthwhile. Would rather have paid a bit more for Hyatt Grand Cypress or Ritz Carlton.

The next morning, I stopped at the front desk and explained the discrepancy in the prices, and the fact that the server never mentioned that my meal would be $60. The front desk clerk immediately spoke with the restaurant manager and credited our account $30, which I thought was fair. The food though, was very fresh and they gave us huge portions.

The concierge lounge is beautifully decorated relaxing space with different seating areas and has great service. The breakfast was continental (breads, cereals, fruit, etc..).

As a classic luxury hotel in a grand older building, the Bohemian is a welcome exception to the cookie-cutter business hotels in town, and a far different experience from the numerous resort and vacation properties in the outer Orlando sprawl. Although the small lobby is decked out in bold colors and features bright contemporary artwork, both for show and sale, at heart, the Grand Bohemian is a serious, old-style city-center business hotel, and if you are in town on business, or just plain sick of resort hotels full of loud and sunburned hordes in t-shirts and flip-flops, there's no better place to stay. This is decidedly not an Orlando fun, sun and boat drinks sort of place: the staid ambience feels far more of Chicago or Philadelphia than anything remotely Floridian. The Bohemian's rooms are very large, comfortable, and very attractively furnished and decorated. The air conditioning - - all important in Orlando's swampy climate - - is strong, efficient and blessedly quiet. Beds and bedding are first rate. The work-out room is nothing special, but the pool, on a 6th floor outdoor terrace, is beautiful and pure bliss. For runners not afraid of serious humidity, the pathways around Lake Eola, just a couple blocks from the hotel, are exceptionally pretty jogging grounds. Hotel staff are mostly well trained, eager and helpful. The parking valets were quick to offer cold, bottled water when I returned from a run, and also quick to retrieve my car when needed. The concierge is very helpful. The front desk had a little trouble retrieving my reservation from the hotel's web-site, but recovered quickly and professionally. As others have noted, downtown Orlando is something of a work in progress, but there are plenty of nearby places to eat and drink. If you want a splurge, the hotel's restaurant, Boheme, is a beautiful and romantic spot, with very good food and a creative wine list (including good excellent offerings by the glass).", "Date": "November 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bermuda", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel, Great Price\u201d", "Author": "LosingLuggage", "ReviewID": "UR10474827", "Content": "I stayed at the Grand Bohemian for 3 nights in July.

We heard the GB was the best hotel in downtown Orlando. In fact, it has won some \"Best of\" awards from Orlando Magazine. We had an executive suite and the accomodations were fine. The room was pretty quiet and the bed was comfortable. But for $350 a night, I expected a bit more in the way of service. We tried to have drinks in the bar upon arrival; it took the waitress nearly 25 minutes to locate the wine we had ordered. Since she had disappeared, there was no way to tell her that we had changed our minds and wanted to go to sleep instead! No worries as she never did locate the bottle. Service at lunch was also remarkably slow (and there were only two other guests in the bar at the time). I spent a small fortune on lunch at the hotel because the concierge had told me that nothing was open for lunch on Saturday in downtown Orlando within walking distance of the hotel. When I later told this to friends who have lived in Orlando for 12 years, they told me how wrong that information was. In fact, the following day, I enjoyed breakfast and lunch within several blocks of the hotel on a friend's recommendation. I also waited a half hour for a cab when departing for the airport. The valets struggled to find me one, and it was I who suggested they call and then call back dispatch when the cab had still not arrived. It's not as if they were understaffed -- there were five valets on at the time, and on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't busy. Also, our entire floor smelled of paint...and we actually saw open paint cans and brushes on a cart on our floor. Locals told me there just aren't that many accomodation options in downtown Orlando.

All 5 lamps in our room were broken. One didn't work at all, while the others were extremely difficult to turn on. We just kept spinning the switch around and around. It became a huge joke, but in truth it was annoying. The room was large and clean, but the windows were a sliver, and when we tried to open the drapes the pull broke off immediately. We left the pull on the floor and no one ever fixed it. There were other things in the room that were shotty - the base of the showerhead was broken off and the wireless connection ($13 a day) was so weak we had to sit at the desk to use it. As far as value goes, we had long days, so we ordered room service. Of course, this is not an inexpensive choice, but even with a 22% gratuity added automatically and a $3 service charge, the waiter told us that he did not receive this money, implying that we should tip him further. Also, to park your car at this hotel, you must use their valet service (no self park) at a whopping $20 a day, plus tips. In all it was just a big disappointment.

I guess I will begin by saying that we were really looking forward to staying at the Grand Bohemian. Being from Florida, and visiting Orlando many times, I have heard such great things about this hotel. Being a frequent vistor of trip advisor, I was aware of the parking, internet charges...but not the nickel and diming for everything. First off, couldnt find street parking, so we had to fork over $21.25 a day for parking. How ridiculous, it should be FREE when staying at the hotel. It costs $11 a day to have internet access, all the food in the room is ridiculously overpirced. We are a younger couple (late 20's), and are not picky at all. We appreciate the little things and like to have a good stay when forking over some heavy money for a hotel room. Upon arriving for check in, we given are keys and not told about the location of the pool, spa services, gym, etc. No mention of anything- heres your key, have a nice stay. We get to our room, two queen beds. Of course we booked a king. Call down to the front desk and they tell us there are no kings left. Great start, no mention of this when checking in, so you can imagine my frustration already. They come up with a plan and tell us there is one king available, but it is handicap. I give them the ok just as long as we are switched the next day. Enough with my story, let me tell you about the hotel. The hotel is very nice and the rooms are quite honestly, nothing spectacular. Nothing better than, say a Embassy Suites. However, the bar and pool are fantastic. I would describe the hotel as a gothic, artsy setting. The location is fantastic if you will be hitting up the bars on orange ave and church st. I will quickly summarize the problems. 1. Given handicap room, so shower was the same level as the bathroom floor. There was a flood like a damn levee broke every time we took a shower. 2. The shower had no hot water, with the exception of one time. What ajoke that was. 3. No fan in the bathroom (are you serious, yes I am). So if you frequent the bathroom like I do, your traveling companion will smell your stinky booty for an hour. 4. $21.25 a day for parking (had to repeat this) 5. Called down for fresh towels, took 45 MINUTES to get them. Absolutley unacceptable, especially when you are waiting to take a shower. 6. Construction above us from 9am-6pm, constant hammering thump. Of course, we were not told about this when checking in. And when your trying to sleep off an Orange Ave hangover, hammering at 9am is no fun. 7. Overbooked, didnt get the room we should have. 8. Greeted horribly at check in, treated like a second class citizen bc we didnt roll up in a porsche or bentley. 9. Charged by the minute to use the internet in the business center. Everywhere i have ever used the business center in the United States has been free; nickel and diming again. 10. Supposed to get a newspaper at your door every morning. Well guess who's room was the only one to not have a paper either days of our stay? One last thing too mention, the tv is a 26 incher from 1995.

More times than not I opt to stay home when heads to Orlando. That said, we could not have been more impressed with the Grand Bohemian. We are semi-frequent travelers and can say we have stayed in some pretty nice places over the years. What I generally find is that regardless of how much we spend, the \"better\" hotels are all pretty much the same...nice, but not stellar. This hotel was different. EVERYTHING about it was great. The staff was attentive, the valets were quick and courteous, the sounds of live jazz permeated the sleek lobby...even the elevators are comfortable!!! (Who ever heard of \"comfortable or even hip elevators??!!) Our room was on the 12th floor. Based on info we acuired from previous reviews, we requested a room facing away from the fire department. Our room overlooked the chic pool area and onto the growing city. We heard sirens one time, and it was briefly around 8PM. As we entered the room, we were met with more beautiful music quietly playing on the bedside Bose radio. The bed was so comfortable (clearly a hold-over \"dream bed\" from the days when the hotel was a Westin).

LOCATION: The Grand Bohemian Hotel (\"GBH\") is a design hotel located in the heart of downtown Orlando and within walking distance to numerous cafes and bars. Like most of Orlando, downtown is a safe area in which to walk at all hours. The building itself is beautiful, as can be seen from the hotel's website. Due to its location downtown and away from WaltDisneySeaWorldMGMUNiversal-de-Soleil, it appears to cater mainly to (i) businesspeople and (ii) locals looking for a posh getaway. It is by no means a \"touristy\" hotel (you won't see the kids with the mickey ears running around the GBH). And, yep, there's a Starbucks downstairs, which is great! COMMON AREAS: The lobby is quite a work of \"art.\" The hotel contains original artworks, many of which are for sale. There is an enormous and unique piano in the lobby, as well as a posh bar and restaurant which appears to be the place to be at night in this neighborhood. Cool jazz music is piped in all over the hotel/elevators/hallways. THE ROOM: As stated, I was given a lovely suite (Room 934), which contains a separate living room and bedroom. The bathroom had a tub/shower whcih was quite large. Starbucks coffee and a little coffee maker were in the bathroom with the appropriate coffee condiments. Also lots of nice Gilchrist & Soames toiletries. (As an aside, I read the reviews below about the bathroom tiles. I don't know what the fuss was about. This was a non-issue for me). The living room was appointed with a large red sofa, a red armchair, and table and chairs. It had its own huge armoir containing a TV (tons of recent \"in theater\" movies for a charge) and mini bar. Two pieces of original artwork hung in the living room. The bedroom contained a california-king-sized bed with white duvet and linens. This used to be a Weston Hotel, and I believe the bed is one of the Weston beds, as it was extremely comfortable (the origin of the bed is purely speculative; the bed being very comfy is fact). The bedroom also contained a similar large armoir with TV and lots of drawers. There are two separate and spacious closets, which was a bit of a waste for me since I only spent one night but otherwise plentiful room for anyone spending a few days. Two bathrobes were provided. A Bose Wave CD radio was on the nightstand in the bedroom. The bedroom contained a large work desk with a high speed internet connection that was very fast indeed (but a $9.95 charge). ROOM SERVICE: The suite was so nice that I chose not to leave it, so I ordered room service from the expansive menu. Delivery was within 30 minutes and everything was cooked to perfection. (Try the wedge salad). Room service deliveryperson was, like all other staff, extremely friendly. 22% tip included + delivery charge (this was overlooked because of the suite upgrade and I shall not look a gift horse in the mouth so for the record I'm not complaining). STAFF: This is the category for which the hotel really shines. From valet parking, to check in, to room service, the staff were terrific and should be commended. Smiles, smiles, smiles. Staff can really make or break a hotel and they were the primary reason that I gave GBH a 5-star review. NOISE ISSUES OR LACK THEREOF: Reading the other reviews below, I was prepared to be located next to a firehouse. Yes, right outside my window indeed is the esteemed \"City of Orlando Fire Station No. 1\". There were emergency vehicles pulling out of the station quite frequently sirens blazing but I just ignored it (it's common city noise). This issue didn't disrupt my stay whatsoever. Otherwise, the room itself was very quiet and I did not hear my neighbors. In sum, this will be my new hotel of choice when in downtown Orlando. Here are the pros and cons to wrap things up: PROS: Staff; design of the hotel; room service menu; room appointment. CONS: Pretty steep valet parking fee; $9.95 charge for Internet access (kind of unecessary for a hotel catering to business guests).", "Date": "March 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cMust Stay at the GB for a Night\u201d", "Author": "Sunskin", "ReviewID": "UR6940161", "Content": "I recently had the distinct pleasure of styaing at the Grand Bohemian Hotel in Orlando, FL.

It was well-worth the total of $289, as I found the complimentary Concierge lounge breakfast on that floor to be wonderful. Plenty of fresh fruits, yogurt, muffins, pastries, fresh-squeezed juices, and Starbucks coffee. The main attraction in this hotel with many gorgeous artifacts, is a very old, expensive Bosendorfer Grand piano. It's one of only two like it in the world. The Bosendorfer lounge is not only beautiful, but perfectly designed from an acoustical standpoint. The evening's entertainment this particular night was the Sunnie Paxson Group.

I'd read that the fire station can be loud but we overlooked the pool on the 14th floor and could hear distant sirens but barely... not loud at all... I am so tired of hotels that housekeeping starts slamming doors when they clean rooms early in the morning but heard none of this. Actually didn't hear a sound from any other rooms... Loved the fact that there were no connecting doors to the next room (that always causes more noise) I didn't hear much of anything and we slept in the next day.

The rooms are a bit pricy and I really did not feel it was worth the money. We stayed in a Jacuzzi suite and it was very spacious. The bedding is very comfortable.

Since I feel as though I was mislead when we booked the room, I will start with the cons. Prior to booking the room my wife asked if the hotel was close to the Orange County Convention Center. The person my wife spoke with said yes, it's a couple of blocks away. Great news, so I thought. I'd walk to the convention, make my rounds, go back to the room and relax for awhile and then return to the convention for the second part of the day. Well, that's not quite how things worked out. The morning that I geared up to go to the convention center, I stopped at the front desk and asked how to get to the convention center. I was told to take a taxi. I explained that I was told I could walk there, but the woman behind the desk told me I would want to take a taxi as it wasn't within walking distance. However, she assured me it wasn't far. So I jump in a taxi and the cabbie drives a number of blocks and then proceeds to enter the expressway. He drives for about 15-20 minutes and $37.00 (with tip) later I am at the convention center. The reality is that the convention center is in excess of 13 miles from the hotel, so don't be fooled like I was. So much for going back to the hotel for a little R&R and then returning to the show for the second part of the day. I spent over $70.00 in taxis each day going to and from the convention center. I was pretty ticked off that they reeled me in by telling me they were close to the convention center. One other thing to note, the complimentary convention shuttles do not service downtown hotels. Morale of story: if you stay downtown, be prepared to pay hefty taxi fares. To continue with the cons of this place, there are freight train tracks close to the hotel -- and those tracks are utilized 24 hours a day. I heard a locomotive's horn several times a night as I was trying to sleep. If that wasn't enough, the hotel is one block away from a fire house. You got it. Throughout the night, when the fire house received calls, I was awakened by sirens! If that wasn't enough, I could hear the couple in the adjacent room talking and sneezing. Another issue is that the ceramic tile floor in the bathroom didn't look clean. The hotel addresses this by having a card in the bathroom explaining that the tile really is clean, but it's defective and they are addressing the problem with whomever they bought it from. Whatever. It looks to me as though the installers didn't do a very good job cleaning the grout and/or mortar and it left stains on the white ceramic. Nevertheless, for the money this hotel charges, I expect better than ceramic tile in the bathroom. On to the good comments, or at least the things that appealed to me about the hotel: it's located away from the chaos of the touristy areas and hotel/motel row. This hotel appears to be geared toward business travelers, so you are not dodging kids running through the hallways and lobby. The room was clean and was a decent size. It accommodated a king sized bed, armoire, couch for lounging, a desk, a table, current pay-per-view movies, a Bose Wave radio, in room internet access (for a fee) and the television remote had a sleep timer. The room also had an iron and ironing board, if you are so inclined. There were various condiments and drinks available, for a fee, in the room. There was a complimentary newspaper each morning and a coffee machine with complimentary Starbucks coffee packets in the room. Nevertheless I preferred to go downstairs to the onsite Starbucks for my morning jolt. I needed an extremely potent concoction as a result of my interupted sleep. The business center is okay, it's open 24 hours. It has a copy machine and a couple of computers, all available for a fee. The bar was nice, had decent food and live entertainment (jazz). It was comfortable and staffed by friendly people. You can sit at the bar, a table or relax in a comfy chair or love seat while enjoying a couple of drinks. There's an outdoor pool, hot tub and cabana as well. However, the pool is only about 3' deep. I'm not much for public pools or hot tubs, but it was nice to relax outdoors in the cabana area. It was a good place to unwind after sitting through rush hour traffic from the convention center. The pool area and cabana is actually kind of attractive and not a bad place to chill. Each time I was up there, there was only one other person hanging out there -- so it evidently doesn't get too crowded especially considering the hotel was at capacity. The hotel security is good in that you need a key card to access the hotel's upper floors (where the rooms are located) when you enter the elevator. The neighborhood the hotel is located in is urban contemporary and has several restaruants that are worth trying. The area is not overrun with people. In fact, after about 5:00, it quiets down quite a bit as the people who work in the offices leave the area and go home. There are some condominium developments currently underway that should bring more people to the area after hours, but right now it's a low keyed, safe area that offers an escape from the chaos that one can experience in Orlando.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "tampa", "Title": "\u201cIf you are looking for a quiet night don't stay here\u201d", "Author": "freqtravelerTampa", "ReviewID": "UR6705711", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful and the staff was great.

The whole place is quite beautiful and well appointed. We liked the art, the lobby bar, the look and feel of a fancy artsy hotel. The room seemed clean, internet was fine. There were a few things that we didn't like. The first room they gave us was in the interior corner. It had one window in the far corner about 8 inches wide and 6 feet tall. I felt like we were in a coffin, it should not have been a room, more like a storage closet. We called down and told them that it would not do. They moved us right away to a better room. Do not come here if you plan to lay in the sun and get some color. Their major flaw in designing the hotel is that they built the hotel to block the pool area from the sun. We were there in November, and there was some sun on the pool area until about 10am, and then it was shade all afternoon - very frustrating when you've come to see the sun. The pool area is just beautiful, white padded lounge chairs, a canopy with chandeliers, tons of towels - but no sun. Also, the key card system in the elevator was a bit pedestrian. It seemed only to slow the system down, and its all the secure as all you have to do is wait for someone else to get in the elevator, and then you can press any button once they've entered their key card. Valet was pricey - and not very informed. We took a cab one night, asked the valet to give the cabbie directions, and the valet's directions took us in the completely wrong direction, cost us 20 min and was super frustrating.

As the name \"Westin\" is to us tatamount to room width and length being approximately equal, it was no small matter when we discovered after having arrived, registered, and entered our room, that the approximate distance from the bathroom door to the opposite interior wall seemed to be no greater than the same measurement within a much less expensive hotel...certainly a small matter, but understand it is not a Westin room.

Here is a breakdown of some pros and cons that I experienced during my stays- Pros: -Great bed=great sleep: Fantastic beds!! This is the biggest reason that I kept coming back... very comfortable. -Nice rooms: Clean, quality furniture with nice lighting and roomy bathrooms (even though the floors and pipes currently look cracked and broken- there's been an apology note for that in every bathroom I've had) -Very unique ambiance: Love the theme. I haven't seen that anywhere else and enjoy the dark colour schemes as well as the art work and mannequins- a very nice touch. -Hotel bar: Great place to relax over a cocktail after a long day. -Location: Great downtown location, most offices and restaurants are nearby. -Staff: Helpful when needed.....but.... (see 'Cons' below) Cons: -Staff: One or two seem like genuinely nice people; the rest rubbed many of us the wrong way. Most of the staff give off a and unapproachable vibe. I have the feeling that many of the staff believe this is the Four Seasons.... its not (and the staff would be a lot warmer if it was!) -Feeling of 'nickel and diming': I understand that quality costs money. What I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t understand is the need to charge ridiculously high rates for rooms (see Four Seasons reference) while continuing to charge for **everything** Although it wasn't my own money, the fact that the room service prices were higher than any other hotel I've stayed at in Orlando (and actually worse tasting than them) and business center pricing was thru the roof ($1/page printing, $5/page fax) turned me off. -Required valet parking at $20/day: Seemed like a good idea at first, but 20 minute waits in the morning (even when calling ahead) as well as the fact that it is MUCH higher priced than other hotels in the area turned me off to it later on. This could also be filed under \"nickel and diming\" -$10/day internet fee: Again, this could be filed under 'nickel and diming' but I felt like it deserved its own point.

We stayed there from a Thursday-Sunday & had a good experience. We never would have stayed at this hotel if we had to pay the full price per night - we got a great deal through Priceline. It was super swanky, and for two young adults from Iowa, who aren't used to such a fancy place, this was a nice change! We stayed on the 14th floor and had a beautiful view of the downtown area. From our room, we could see the pool on the 6th floor. We did use the pool - 3 feet across the whole way. It's good for cooling off after laying out, which is what we used it for! We had drinks in the hotel bar/restaurant one night before going out. There was a live 3 piece band playing - piano, singer, & saxophone. It was a bit loud, but our bartender was very polite. Drinks were expensive, but everything at the hotel was. Room service was out of the question for the price they were asking, but we don't usually use room service anyway. We thought about grabbing a sandwich from the restaurant for lunch one day, however, my husband was wearing shorts & a baseball cap (both of which were prohibited by their \"dress code.\" So, we decided to take our business elsewhere. I really liked the \"heavenly\" shower & bed, but my husband said he didn't care for the pillows (which were feather & quite soft). Our room was equipped with a spacious bathroom, full length mirror, mini bar, armoire hiding the television & drawers, a desk, a Bose clock radio & a \"bohemian\" jazz CD, King sized bed, and a large couch. Just having a room with painted walls (as opposed to the usual white of hotels), a fancy headboard, and paintings other than the regular ho-hum that you usually see, it was a nice change to feel like we were living in the lap of luxury for a few days. The room came with 2 robes, however, on the day of check out we were \"missing\" one of the robes. I had worn one down to the pool & back up to the room, but we weren't sure where the 2nd one had gone (perhaps it was taken by the maid, but never replaced)? I called the front desk & explained that I didn't want to be charged for the robe, and she told me she would contact the executive housekeeper. When we checked out, I mentioned again the issue & said we didn't want to be charged for something we hadn't taken. So far, we have not been charged for the robe, which I appreciated very much.

It's trying to be a world-class hotel full of art and excitement, when it's actually just a corporate place to rest your head. The attitude of a girl at the front desk was so snobbish that I think it ruined my stay. I apparently made the horrendous mistake of wearing a baseball cap while I was checking in. Maybe she was having a bad day, but the overall feeling of the staff creeped me out with their snobbish attitude. I'm in the corporate world and stay at starwood hotels often, and a couple of my favorite hotels are in their W chain. While I've encountered a little snobbishness here and there, the attitude at this Orlando location took top spot. The grounds of the hotel are all right. It's not a high rise, and two of its four sides are dwarfed by high rises, so if you like a view, your chances are slim of getting one from your window. The pool is on the \"rooftop\" of the sixth floor (the hotel is 12 or 13 floors). It may have been a nice idea if they didn't put a 7' wall around the pool area so that you can't see anything. The pool is very small and only 3 1/2' deep. The spa/whirlpool didn't work, and had a sign stating such with a \"frown\" face. I'm pretty sure it was written by a guest, because I think a staff person would have wrote something like, \"You're not good enough for the spa, so we turned it off.\" The workout room, although very small, was equipped with modern equipment and was very nice. The room was decent, and the beds were okay. They are supposed to be their \"heavenly\" beds, but I really didn't find them to be anything great. I love the beds at W hotels, but these were a little too firm and the pillows were far too small. The bathroom was large, but the shower was retarded. Although it had two showerheads, the shower curtain is much too short so that when you try to take a shower, the entire bathroom floor gets soaked (I had to use all my spare towels each time to soak up the water). They indicated, via a small sign, that they were having issues with their bathroom tiles. I wonder if they're smart enough to add the two together. Also, the shower head came out of the wall and the pipe was exposed. I don't really care and probably wouldn't mention it, but since they gave me so much attitude, I figure what the heck. As for the food served through room service, it was pretty tame. I ordered a few appitizers for myself and my guest. Two of the three were decent and both priced at around $13, which I thought was fair for room service. What really ticked me off, however, was the $11 order of \"crispy potatoes\" which I swear were Ore Irda microwave fries. They were really gross, which cracked me up since their description on the menu sounds very gourmet. It's a theme of the hotel. As for the room overall, it was adequate. The pictures posted on this site sum it up. It's corporate, plain, with a few pieces of art thrown here and there. If you don't know too much about art, but like to think you do, you'll probably love it. The review about Orlando being a cultural wasteland likely sums up the hotel: pretentious, snobbish, arrogant, ignorant, blah, blah, blah. If you have no concerns about money and you like to travel to mid-size cities and complain about how they aren't NYC, stay here and find others at the bar who will complain with you. For the rest of you who obviously realize Orlando is not New York, is not Miami, but is its own city, consider staying somewhere that's not so expensive, and spend your money on the culture that dwells outside of Orange Ave. If you do stay here, try to deal with the young Asian-American male who works at the front desk. He was the only one who seemed genuinely nice. My hotel bill incorrectly had $105 of extra charges, and he corrected it and apologized.

Also, every time you happen to run into an employee in the hotel, rather than just saying good day or something, they feel the need to go into detail about the art in the hotel or tell you how great the property is. I felt more like I was on a museum tour than in a hotel and my wife and I quickly learned to avoid all contact with employees if possible. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in the restaurant so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on that, but out of everyone at the hotel, the best employees that we encountered were the valet drivers. They made excellent dinner recommendations and gave great directions. Earlier when I asked a front desk agent how to get to the TD Waterhouse center I was told that they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sure, but they would get someone to help me out, 10 minutes later a manager came out and gave me directions, but one would think someone working the front desk would know where a local attraction 4 blocks from the hotel is. On a good note, the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room was of adequate size and was clean, but I suppose the Embassy Suites has spoiled me with its extra touches. For instance, when I stay at an ES, I have complimentary water and Milano cookies in the room, at the Westin they wanted to charge me $5 for a bottle of Evian. The bathroom was spacious and had very nice amenities; the only gripe with it was how tiny the bathtub was. They call the thing a heavenly tub, but my standard bathtub at home is larger.

The tubs are your basic ordinary (small) bathtubs, and there isn't even any bath bubble powder in the rooms. About the only thing that stands out is the dual-head showers, but if you look closely you'll notice that even those (as well as the sink fixtures and toilet) are cheap \"pretend-elegant\" fixtures. It's a bit incongrous with the marble sink and floor, but maybe they were running over-budget on the bathrooms. The place absolutely has a \"renovated motel\" feel to it. The doors slam loudly and can be heard in the rooms, and the corridors are low and dark, and there are definitely too many signs directing guests to the ice machines. One other strange experience made me feel like I was staying in a hotel which was trying to prove its merit: EVERY staff member whom I encountered was quick to tell me how wonderful the hotel was. Whether it was the waitress in the restaurant explaining to me (unprompted by any inquiry) that the artwork was all original and from the personal collection of the owner and then going on to explain to me how wonderful the presentation of my salad was, or the bartender chatting me up and reminding me I was in the best bar in Orlando, it's clear the staff is coached on reminding guests how lucky they are to be staying here. It was unsettling to me, as if they were all trying to hide some insecurity the place has about its place in the hotel world. A note on the restaurant: it's good, very good even, but it's extremely expensive - disproportionately so. Dinner for one with salad, dessert, coffee and two glasses of wine ran me $100. I'm no cheapskate when it comes to dining, but this place just wasn't worth the price tag. A much better dining option is the short menu in the bar - sandwiches and appetizers like spring rolls and calamari run around $10-$12. I had a great burger and an even better tenderloin sandwich. Breakfast at the restaurant is adequate, but at the usual exorbitant hotel prices. I would definitely stay again, and have no real complaints about the hotel.

We stayed at the hotel for a romantic, relaxing weekend and the Westin definitely fulfilled that need.

The bathroom was luxurious with 2 shower heads (great water pressure), marble countertop, large shower & mirrors, and comfy bathrobes. My room also had a nice table/sofa area and a large tv, but by far my favorite thing was the BED. It was the most comfortable bed ever...tons of pillows, soft sheets, and a great feather comforter. Our view was of the pool located on top of the parking garage. It was surreal to be swimming around these huge buildings. The pool is a medium size pool with an attached jacuzzi. My only complaint was the jacuzzi was a too hot and it was a bit annoying to be swimming and see pepole watching you from their room. The area is clean and there are lounge chairs to lay out and a shaded area under a canopy w/ chandeliers (a nice touch). The hotel is located near clubs, bars and resturants in the downtown area, which was nice b/c we could walk everywhere. It is also a few blocks away from Lake Eola, which is a lake in the middle of downtown. It's a nice, relaxing walk around the lake and surprisingly very quiet. I did find a few negative things about the hotel such as parking, it's ONLY VALET PARKING and it's quite expensive - about $19 a night (more if you have a SUV). There aren't many parking spaces in downtown, so you're forced to park there. The entrance is difficult to find, in the pictures it appears to be on the corner but really it's next to the valet enterance in the back (watch out when you're trying to find it b/c there is bus only lanes and lots of one way streets). Also something I found a bit annoying was the hotel sponsors an art scholorship and adds $1 to your bill, this was not told to us beforehand and I found out our last day when I got my valet bill. Granted it's only a $1 so you feel obligated to leave it on there, and it does mention if you don't want to participate you can take it out, which by then you feel cheap since it's only $1.

Firstly, take a standard mid-range Orlando hotel, paint on a thin veneer of class (as in add a few framed pictures, throw in some above average furniture), then, add lots of overpriced extras to make people feel like they are staying somewhere super special and voila, you have The Westin Grand Bohemian. I do understand the building's size & location has limited what they could do with the place, so i'll excuse the tiny low ceilinged corridors. The ice dispensers on every floor feel a little motelish, but thats just being picky. It's when I enter the bathroom and find that the \"Heavenly Bath\" they proudly advertise on their website has turned into a \"Heavenly Shower\", that I begin to feel a little let down. Oh, it's a bath to be sure, but one that would scarcely fit a midget amputee. I then move to the back of the room and spy a large bottle of Evian water sitting on the desk. \"Complimentary! What a wonderful touch.\" I think to myself, as it is located nowhere near the mini bar, however I am disappointed to find that a $5 price tag hangs from the kneck. After suffering the midday heat of Orlando, this is a cruel blow indeed. So I take a shower in the Heavenly Shower, and the double shower heads are really doing my body a great service, and after that pleasentness, I slip my body into a bathrobe which I feel I must purchase for myself, because it is *the* best bathrobe that has ever had the pleasure of being wrapped around my shivering form. Moving from the bathroom I throw myself onto the bed, sink in, and view the entertainment system that I had used before in La Quinta Inn. \"There's that motel feeling again, I guess this place really is for those with more money than sense.\" Breakdown: One night, Two small bottles of mineral water, Total cost: approx 360 dollars", "Date": "May 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winter Park,Fl.", "Title": "\u201cGreat get away!!\u201d", "Author": "hdefx", "ReviewID": "UR3457271", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Bohemian for a weekend get away.

It has a private rooftop pool in the center or Downtown Orlando and two Bosendorfer Grand Pianos (1 in the Jazz bar, and another upstairs). The lobby contains an art gallery, Starbucks coffee, Jazz bar, and five star restaurant (also full of art). The main attraction for the hotel, is its location (within walking distance of all of downtown Orlando), its decor (vibrant and risquee without being weird), and an amazing restaurant. I dine here frequently, typically ordering an array of gourmet appetizers as my meal: Baked Brie in Philo, Blue Cheese Wedge Salad, and the Spring Salad in Pear dressing . . . all amazing. Last note of interest, is that on Friday evenings after work, the jazz bar is crammed with young professionals (bankers, lawyers, and financiers) from surrounding businesses.

The bathroom awesome - especially one small detail - the shower curtain rod bows away from the tub, so it never touches you. Brilliant! Room service was superb at both 2am and 9am. I didn't hang out in the bar downstairs, but it was hoppin' on a Thursday night. Valet parking is $19/night...kind of steep, so just be prepared for that. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that my \"final\" bill included a room charge even though I redeemed my Starwood points. This was an obvious error that I brought to their attention.

Two blocks from the hotel there are many bars and clubs that are packed on the weekends. Like the other reviews say, this is also a great spot to see some NBA players!

Very disappointed -- it's a typical Westin, with a very comfortable Heavenly Bed, but with three real weaknesses. First, the rooms are really dark -- with all the lights on, it's still like being in a dimly-lit drawing room. It's nice to have the ambience, but it would be better to at least have the option of being able to see when you wanted to. Second, and more importantly, there's one small air vent at one end of the room, and the air just doesn't circulate. There was a strong burning-plastic smell in the room that never went away the whole time we were there, even with the fan set on high. Third, downtown Orlando is a ghost town, and as a result, this hotel has nothing attractive in walking distance. That, along with the poor air quality and dark rooms, means that you'd be far better off staying in Winter Park near shops and walking streets, or in the Disney area where you'd at least have a nice view out the window. Personally, I wish we'd stayed at the Westin Swan near Disney -- still would have had the Heavenly Bed, with cheaper rooms and a much nicer atmosphere.", "Date": "December 20, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "brandon, fl", "Title": "\u201cenjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "dodo333", "ReviewID": "UR2900566", "Content": "My wife, 18 month old and I stayed at the hotel for the weekend.

I must say that this hotel is awesome, especially for any couples looking for romance in the city, the bars are up and down by the hotel and the hotel jazz bar is very nice and upscale.
