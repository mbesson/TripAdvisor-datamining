I would have felt more safe if my friend and I (2 single females) weren't the ONLY two people staying in the building. I quickly contacted the front desk and told them that our new placement was unacceptable, and they somehow found an open room in the building we originally booked.

I think the rooms are non smoking which is a little annoying but the windows open nice and wide, the windows also have steel shutters! :o As we approached the building there is the french embassy on the corner (i think it was the French i didn't look into it) which is guarded by armed soldiers 24/7 so i guess its a pretty safe location, although the sight of the guns unnerved me some :) there didn't seem to be many guest when we stayed but it was October, and at least the place was quite!

We ended up reserving a private double with shared bath, which at the time was significantly cheaper than the private ensuite. Upon arrival to a dark and rainy Rome, we made our way to Hotel des Artistes to check in (the check in/lobby area is on the fifth floor). During the check in process we offered a room with private ensuite bath for a discounted price for the second night of our stay, which we are glad we did. After checking in, we were led a couple blocks north to an annex which was located in one of the three buildings that house the Hotel des Artiste/Carlito's Way rooms. The room was sufficient, nothing luxurious, but it provided a place to sleep and the shared bath was directly across the hall and was usually never occupied which was nice. During the day after our first night, our bags were moved by the staff to our new room in a building next to the main building and we found the new accomodations much more luxurious. A flat screen tv mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed, a spotlessly clean bathroom, and efficient air conditioner were welcomed. The use of three buildings keeps the exact location of your room a secret until you arrive, but they are all within a few minutes walk of the main building. Each building has a lift, which makes lugging heavy bags much easier. The main building is a few blocks from Rome's Termini train station and metro, which makes travelling much more convenient, although Rome is better explored on foot. The staff were very welcoming and went out of their way to help us feel comfortable. Overall, the private ensuite rooms of Carlito's Way are Highly Recommended. However, if your main concern is your budget, the rooms with shared bath will serve you well as a base for showering and sleeping.", "Date": "October 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "CANADA", "Title": "\u201cWe Loved Carlito's Way\u201d", "Author": "barbRev", "ReviewID": "UR5233781", "Content": "We LOVED Carlito's Way, and would happily recommend it to friends.
