At Dragon, there's a cool cocktail/tapas bar and restaurant downstairs, gets very busy at night but yet the noise upstairs is really very well attenuated. Rooms are not quite as spacious as at Leon de Oro, but the pricing reflects this. In any case, the rooms are bright, clean and comfortable, funky decor and if we're honest, we preferred Dragon to Leon de Oro though there wasn't much in it - a personal call.

We did not know Madrid when we chose this hotel and as more mature travelers we would have preferred a less crowded area.

For example, the room was so small that there was really nowhere to be except in or on the bed. In our case, the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom (strange). On the plus side the shower was great. Also, the prices for food and drinks in this area is considerably higher than other parts of the city; however, most of central Madrid is easily reachable within a maximum 20 minute walk or from multiple metro stops. The hotel staff was welcoming and friendly. Check-in (and the \"front desk\") is in a bar on the ground floor which can get noisy and crowded. There is no lobby for hotel guests, and it can be disorienting and annoying to have to navigate a crowded bar to check in or get to your room. Also, noise from the bar could be an issue due to an open central courtyard off of which all rooms open, and I would imagine that rooms on the front (street side) would get a lot of noise at night from the street.

It is in a terrific location in La Latina district, 7-8 minutes from Sol Metro, 5 minutes from Tirso de Molina Metro and less than 5 minutes from the fabulous Plaza Mayor. If you want location you can't beat this place. Do check out the Mercado San Miguel just up the street too. A really good and safe place to try a wide range of tapas and drinks in a safe environment. A good place to start if you need to build your confidence before trying the bars and restaurants elsewhere. The street on which the hotel resides - Calle Cava Baja - was full to bursting on the weekend we stayed in Madrid . But the atmosphere was great, no hint of tension or binge drinking and enough range of bars to serve the young crowd and those of us a little more mature. The hotel itself doubles up as a tapas bar and I can see why some people can feel a little intimidated if you return to the hotel before midnight and expect to go quietly to your bed. This isn't the place for that type of break be warned. We loved it, however, and as we were in Madrid for culture and pleasure we were not in bed before 2.00 a.m. (still early by Madrid standards). Like the rest of my party I was in a single room. Fairly small and basic for a four star hotel it has to be said, but everything worked. TV with wide range of channels, super comfortable bed, decent storage and mini-bar. The highlight, however, was the rainbow shower which was exceptional. Didn't try breakfast but did use the bar and this was a very nice place. Newspapers are on hand in the bar/reception area if you are waiting for your friends to rise from their respective beds. Posada del Dragon is good hotel in a fine city. Madrid is a cultural and culinary delight with lovely people and not like a capital city. I stayed in Barcelona last year and it knocks spots off that place. My marks are high because this contributed to our strong connection to the hotel. It gets 5 out of 5 for me.

It is in a great location in the heart of the old city and on a street that has dozens of tapas bars. In fact the lobby of the hotel is a tapas bar too. It is popular with locals and was really busy when we arrived off a flight from London at 9pm on a Friday night. We had to weave our way through the crowd to check in and were then shown to our rooms. The smaller rooms are gathered around a central courtyard and some of them are tiny and with only internal doors and glass walls - meaning that you cannot have fresh air. My single companions had two of these little rooms, while my sister and I shared a balcony room at the front of the hotel. This was bigger and had the benefit of external windows but yikes was it noisy. As you probably know Madrid parties all night and so with the window open we were intermittently woken by revellers and garbage collectors all night. We didn\u2019t mind but others might \u2013 so you need to choose between a bigger room and fresh air, or air-conditioning and a smaller internal room. All the rooms have very cool and clever d\u00e9cor, themed around bright colours and startling shapes, glossy white headboards and nifty cupboards. The showers were EXCELLENT, the bed supremely comfortable and the breakfast was probably the best I have had in Europe. The breakfast room has a bar offering a great selection of savoury and sweet breads & pastries as well as eggs (cooked to order), great coffee, fresh orange juice, a delicious egg tortilla and fruit, yoghurt etc. We ate in the tapas bar too \u2013 on the night of our arrival.
