But let me first start out with the positives: There were no bed bugs. They supplied soap The breakfast was supposedly good according to my parents they have wifi they also have a computer to use in the front if you need it okay, now to the bad side: as i said it's in need of updating, not just the rooms but the staff. the place wasn't cleaned well AT ALL. I actually cleaned the tv myself and wiped down the screen which was covered in some kind of gooey slime, possibly from kids touching it or something. the towels didn't look clean, they looked like they had just been folded without going to the laundry. The sink counter looked cracked and the lighting in the bathroom was an incredibly bright florescent that made me feel like i was about to be put on an operating table at the hospital. The sheets on the bed felt like they weren't completely dried. The carpet was dirty and old. the heating and cooling system is in need of some filter cleaning which actually is really important because if you don't clean a filter you can grow black mold. you can tell the filter wasn't clean because you could smell the dust burning when switched to heat.
