We stayed on the 4th floor and had a great view of the ocean. The kitchen was well stocked and the dishes were clean. We were worried about the refrigerator not working but after the first day it seemed fine and kept our groceries cold. The elevator was a bit slow but that is to be expected with older motels.

Because of the cheaper price, we chose a poolside room over an ocean front room. The only rooms available were a non-smoking room with a king-sized bed, and a smoking room with two double beds. We really do not like staying in smoking rooms because of the smell of stale smoke. My wife has asthma and I get nauseous when I smell smoke for too long. However, since our daughter was staying with us we needed a room with two beds, so we went with the smoking room. The room included two double beds, a refrigerator, and a microwave. The room was clean, but we were able to smell the stale smoke. The bathroom had a fan and the shower was very forceful. The towels were typical of what you get at a cheap motel. They were very thin and well worn. There was a shower curtain, but no liner. When you took a shower, you got water all over the floor. This was \"senior week\" at the beach, so we knew we were taking a chance by staying at an inexpensive motel. Any time you mix alcohol and recently graduated high school seniors, you are asking for trouble. Some of the motels do not care about the noise; they want to rent the rooms. Late at night, we heard kids running and yelling. We ignored the noise and went back to sleep. This happened about every hour or so until it finally stopped. We found out why the next day. I was speaking to one of the other guests. He asked me if I had heard the noise. I told I had, but we mostly slept through it. He said it sounded like a \u201cgang war.\u201d He told me that the cops finally came to try to quiet things down. There were a lot fewer guests the next day, so I assume the kids were evicted. He told me \u201cNever again.\u201d I can understand as he had traveled from Pittsburgh with his family and expected to have a nice stay in Ocean City. I suppose that it was not a bad room for the price. However, I would not recommend that families or couples stay there. It is definitely a place for young 18 and 19 year olds who want to party.

I was even more skeptical when I drove in, looking at the empty parking lot and the streetside motel building.

We stayed in the beachside motel, up on the 4th floor to see over the dunes (you don't want on the first floor, all you can see is the dunes). To be fair, you're going to have completely different experiences based on which one of these buildings you are in. But my oh my. Efficiency apartment, two double beds and a pullout, a balcony, a very functional kitchen... everything worked, everything clean, and the service was excellent. The view from the balcony was unforgettable. The room had just been retouched over the season prior to our arrival, I think we were the first in it of the year. We had to have maintenance come and unclog a drain, did well. Front desk service was very good. We had to make a call on noisy neighbors, that was handled well too.

Note: There is a sand dune in front of the building and the first floor units can not view the beach/ocean. However, we find that the convenience of the first floor is wonderful. Every first floor unit has it's own grassy area/patio and they're individually fenced. When you leave the beach, you bring your chairs right to your patio, and don't have to drag them inside your unit to the balcony. The furnishings are typical beachy furnishings. Nothing modern. The efficiency kitchen area is nothing to brag about but everything is very clean. Dishes, flatware and some glasses are supplied but I never use anything I can't run thru the dishwasher first. And I always bring my own frying pan because people are so unkind to stainless steel cookware. The Dunes offers daily maid service and they do a good job and I've never had any issues with things stolen (but I do hide my valuables). We went in mid-July when the weather is hot and the ocean temps are bearable. I do NOT recommend this property in the month of June because it's taken over by graduated high school seniors and they are very obnoxious - and they love The Dunes because it's cheap.

The women at the desk said they would work on it and let us know if they could make the change because the motel was close to capacity.

We booked a pool view room that had a refrigerator (good size) and microwave (fairly small). The AC definitely worked, our room was an ice box!! The location is awesome. It is the 1st motel on the boardwalk so the area is fairly quiet compared to downtown. You can take the trolley (for a small fee) from the motel, straight to downtown. The beach is steps away which was great too. The pool is a decent size, it was never overly packed. There is a shower for people to use before/after pool usage. They also have a kiddy pool. Each morning the pool was cleaned by the grounds crew and it didn't smell like chlorine. We had breakfast at the Victorian (the sister hotel, Dunes Manor Hotel). The food was fresh and fairly priced compared to local restaurants The only thing that would have been nice is if they had more ice machines, there was 1 ice machines and that was located inn the front desk in the lobby. Overall, I would recommend this motel to anyone looking for a simple, clean place to stay. We will definitely return! Recommendations: Food: Brassballs Saloon: (breakfast) you could sit outdoors upstairs in the shade with a beautiful view. Charlie's Restaurant: a bit of a drive north but well worth it. The food was fresh and delicious! It is more of a locals restaurant so it wasn't packed. It was located on the bay. We had outdoor seating so we were able to watch the sunset. Higgins: Next door to Dunes, dinner was good, we all enjoyed the seafood. JR's Ribs: Good Food, great service and decent price. Activities: Jolly Roger Park: 5 parks at 1 location!

We were told that the price drops from $36.99+ to $20.99 at 2:45pm so we went at 2:45pm (we were there for only 2 hours so it was worth it for us).

I was thinking it was going to smell very dingy or like that stale bar room smell....not at all!!! It smelled very fresh and clean! Didn't notice any smoke smell at all. The whole room was newly remodeled and everything was well stocked.

I've stayed in a lot of hotels up and down the boardwalk as well as some of the higher end hotels like the Princess Royale and the Holiday Inn on the Boardwalk but our family's budget in recent years has put us in a position where we have felt the need to choose smaller and more budget priced hotels and motels. This has often compromised amenities, service, and yes even cleanliness and we have never found a place to return to year after year. Well, our mission was accomplished during our recent stay at the Dunes Motel! I just recently got married and this was my first trip to Ocean City with my wife. My parents also joined us on this trip for a few days and we were able to find two rooms at the Dunes Motel for a week last minute within our price range. We stayed in the West/Poolside building where the rooms have been recently renovated and they did an excellent job. The rooms are tastefully decorated and have all the basics that you'll need for a week at the beach including a microwave and refrigerator, plenty of storage space, and a small but clean bathroom with plenty of fresh towels. The staff at the Dunes is extremely friendly and polite from the desk staff to the maids. The location of the Dunes Motel is great as well because it's at the end of the boardwalk where you can catch the trolly and be to where all the action is in minutes, but you're still far enough away that it's in a more quiet neighborhood. I think that one of the main reasons that the Dunes Motel has a top-notch staff and is so well cared for is that it is basically an extension of the Dunes Manor Hotel which is one of the top hotels in town. We went over to the Victorian Room in the Dunes Manor two mornings for breakfast and were well impressed by the service and the value. We also spent a few evenings in the Zippy Lewis Lounge having drinks and listening to Shirley Toms play the piano. It was a nice touch that we were able to use the Restaurant and Lounge at the Dunes Manor and charge it to our room at the Dunes Motel. All in all we were extremely impressed with the Dunes Motel and this was one of the first times that we've stayed in a small budget priced motel in Ocean City and not had to clean our room before we use it.

My husband and I had a regular hotel room in the \"poolside\" building, and while it was nothing fancy, it certainly was clean and had that vintage beachy vibe. The cleaning staff were there promptly each morning. My parents had secured one of the 2-bedroom apartments (oceanside), which was on the first floor. It even had a small \"lawn\" and patio, fenced in, which was perfect for the kiddos, giving everyone space to gather and spread out. My parents and grandparents shared that place. The rest of the family had reserved efficiencies or hotel rooms. There were about 20 of us total, including 6 kids, and I think it all worked out great. With the apartment and efficiency kitchens, we could prepare meals and not have to eat out all the time (though we did enjoy that as well).

We booked into a \"2-room patio apartment\" in the oceanside building (not the poolside buildings). We loved it! The room: We had a 2-room patio apartment. I Enter into a bedroom with 2 beds, a dresser and 2 nightstands and an open-closet area/corner easily big enough to store a cooler and suitcases after you've unpacked. Bathroom was roomy, much larger than the baths in the poolside buildings and more updated with larger cabinetry/sinktop area. Living/kitchen area had a pull-out sofa, side table and a table for 4 with a small full-size fridge/freezer and mini range with small sink area. Too small to spend more than 3-4 days and not big enough to actually cook meals and eat - we always eat out. Patio area: we were first floor so had a nice patio area with overlooked the dunes. If you are not ground level, you had a balcony and a view of the ocean. The patio area is great if you have small kids because they have an outdoor area to play and each unit is INDIVIDUALLY fenced in and gated. We had 2 lounge chairs and 2 chairs with blooming day lillies. Just a short walk over the dune area and there was the beach. An easy walk if you want to return to make lunch or use the restroom. If you need extra room, The Dunes has many different-type rooms, including some 2-bedroom 1st floor units. Housekeeping: always wonderful. I've stayed here many times and staff is very nice and does a fine job. Location, location, location: At the end of the boardwalk at 27th Street. Don't underestimate this location as being at the end of all the action. At the end of a long day, it's nice to be away from the action. Just beside The Dunes you can rent your bikes for the boardwalk each morning. The beach isn't as crowded as farther down the boardwalk either. I highly recommend you DON'T stay at this hotel during the month of June. Or any hotel in Ocean City for that matter. That entire month is considered \"senior week\" for students graduating from high school. Ocean City itself is completely taken over by high school grads who can't handle their booze or act appropriately. It's not a month to take your kids and your time WILL be ruined. In OC, there's a law that says hotels can not discriminate against renters based on their age and so they must rent to them, however, it's hard to control their behavior. If you're looking for good mexican food, try Tequila Mockingbird at 130th street in the Montego Bay shopping center. Looks like a dive, but food is great. Also, for crabs I recommend PGN crabhouse on 29th Street and Higgins Crab House on 30th Street.

But we figured we give it a shot and walk away with our own opinion afterwards. Check in was a breeze,the front desk lady was polite and accommodating,since our room wasn't ready.,she still gave us a parking pass so that we could keep our vehicle in the motel lot and offered that we were welcome over at their sister Hotel next door and use their pool/dressing facilities and restaurant. When our room was ready I was really quite pleased when we walked into our room despite the older look of the building. The room was clean,no bugs as one of the reviewers commented,no mold/mildew that I saw. I was expecting a shoe box sized room from another review but it seemed very spacious for our crew,the beds seemed big enough for me even supplied extra pillows and linens for the pull out couch that I will say had seen its better days but personally I don't let a small matter like that ruin my whole stay. There was a bright wide window with a gorgeous view of the ocean and beach right infront of us,with a door with a lock that could open out towards an enclosed balcony. The kitchen and sink area seemed efficient enough for our stay. We brought our own food from home to cook in the room during our stay and there was enough cabinet space and refrigerator space. Bathroom was small but again,there was enough room to hold our toiletries in a cabinet under the sink and well equipped with lots of towels. The floor was clean but my only complaint was that the water pressure was alittle strong,but we theorized that was to spray the sand off your body from the beach in the shower. In front of the motel is a large fenced in sand dune that are considered few and a protected resource down at any beach due to the fact local birds and wildlife reside in them and I did not see a piece of garbage,anywhere,anyplace to tell you the truth. Outdoor pool was alittle small,but I don't go to the beach to swim in Olympic sized swimming pools at motels. The indoor outdoor pool was warmed like bathwater,clean,kept my daughter happy when the weather was kinda cloudy out that day. I didn't try the jacuzzi since I am currently pregnant but dipped my toes in the water, husband liked it and btw,jacuzzis are supposed to be hot and you're not supposed to stay in one all day. The motel is situated right at the beginning of the Boardwalk right on 27th street,you can catch a Boardwalk Tram car right there,in the morning you can watch people rent out bicycles and bicycle carts,while watching Ocean Citys trademark sunrises drinking a hot cup of coffee from the coffee maker already supplied in our room. We were just shaking our heads wondering if the people whom really put this place down stayed in some either really fancy hotels or are really picky about things to come to some of the conclusions they did.

A friend of mine recommended this motel to me. I've had some bad experiences with other motels so I was a little frantic. However, there was no need to worry this time. One of the most important things to me is the cleanliness of the facility. The room was very clean, (and believe me I checked everything 2x), the overall facility was clean. The ocean view was amazing & the room was the perfect size for me, my husband & my 4 year old son ( I wouldn\u2019t recommend more than 4 people per room, as the rooms aren\u2019t large enough to fit more than that).. A few things could have been better to make our stay more convenient/comfortable; the beds were very uncomfortable (the cheapest mattress set on the planet must have been on what we were sleeping on), there is no iron/ironing board in the room (you have to call down to the front desk to ask for it), there were only 3 drawers (so we had to leave all of our stuff in the suit case), and last but not least, parking was terrible.

Our first impression of the motel was a smelly wet elevator. When we opened the door to our room... our smiles left our faces. The room was ALOT smaller than we expected. For a room that \"sleeps 6 \" they only had 3 small drawers to put your clothes in. We had to leave our clothes in our suitcases and...not much room for your suitcases!The very small kitchen had only 1 sink, making it very difficult to wash dishes. The bathroom floor was a mess! it was all stained up and in need of replacement. I had to leave my shoes on! Very excited to have an oceanfront balcony a place where we like to relax was even disappointing. They have a fenced in dune as long as the building that is loaded with GARBAGE!!! If you can over look the garbage, the view of course is great! The beds are small, my husband and I had to sleep in separate beds, and the children had to sleep on the SPRINGY sofa bed, not fit for a dog!!!The air conditioner was very noisy, rattling on and off during the night, waking us up several times. The pool...a must for us, was FREEZING COLD, making it very difficult to enjoy the pool. We are allowed to go over to the Dunes HOTEL , so we ventured over to their \"pools.\" The HOTEL states they have an indoor and an outdoor pool, what they don't tell you is that it is (half indoor and half outdoor) only 1 pool. That explains why they don't show it on-line. The HOTEL pool temp. is in the 80 s and mostly shaded. The jacuzzi temp. was 110 degrees!!! very uncomfortable, not able to stay in more than 4 minutes. I realize you get what you pay for. What it cost to stay at the Dunes Motel, is not worth the money you spend. My family and I do not get away much, did not feel like a vacation.

VICKY MORRIS, the hotel/motel manager/owner should not be in this position. Never in my life have I EVER been treated the way I was treat.ed My friend and I were degraded and harrased by the Dunes motel/hotel staff and managers and owner, VICKY MORRIS. After driving 7 hours, we were unable to check in because there computers were down. Then they give us the key to a tupperwear box room pool side, when we booked an OCEANFRONT ROOM!!! Then, manager Armando gets involved by phone. Finally, hours later after screaming over the phone, he leaves a message on our room phone that an oceanfront room will be ready in the morning and his manager, Vicky Morris, will be contacting us at 9AM. That is when Vicky Morris calls and shows how ignorant she really is. This woman needs to be fired or her license should be taken away. With an attitude, she started out saying that we were refusing to pay for our second night, and she treatened to keep our belongings because we would not have access to our room, even though all of our paper work stated we were booked until Sunday!!!! Even our parking permit said Sundays date!!!!!!! After we were threatened, we met her in the lobby, called the police and filed a report, then called the better business bureau. The police department stated there has been 5 reports of items stolen from this motel in the past 2 years. Finally, after another wasted hour of our vacation, we finally are told we can move to our ocean front room, but we have to pay the $70 dollar difference. We say fine!! She then says, once she sees the coupon code, she will refund the money...not a problem. It will be faxed later in the day to her. We think all is settled and we move on, pack up our stuff, move to our room, unpack AGAIN, the phone rings....its them again.....the credit card isn't working....come back down.....UNBELIEVABLE!!!! So we go back down!!!!! They are trying to bill us for the entire ocean front room, not the difference of the poolside room of $70!!!!! So we kindly explain to the motel staff, who should know simple math, to transfer the amount that was paid at check in. We just paid the $70 in cash and left. Over and done with..... Back to room we go.....phone rings again.....didn't answer it......phone rings again......didn't answer it.......This time they left a message....At this point, we are so ticked off, we just want to leave. So we go to the beach. When we get back 1/2 hour later, we check the message. It is the hotel staff again wanting us to come down to the lobby again....So we take a shower. But, before we can leave..there is a knock at the door. IT\"S VICKY MORRIS, HOTEL MANAGER/OWNER!!!!! WOW.......Now, She is saying that we are going around telling people that we were overcharged!!! Unbelievable!!!!!! Not only that, She is still telling us that we have a balance due of $286.00!!!! UH, NO WE DON'T!!!!! And that our credit card is still declined. So, We call the credit card company. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION TO THIS!!!! We found out that the hotel charged the credit card 7 times for the 2nd night (over $1000.00). There were multiple charges all within 5 minutes of each other. The credit card company caught it as fraudulent charges and put a hold on it and contacted the home number and alerted us). It was coming up declined by the motel staff because the charged was already put through at check in and signed for. (Duplicate charge) Thank god for fraud alert!!! When we went to Vicky Morris's office at the hotel, she had 4 security guards waiting for us. She still insisted our card was bad...denying it was there mistake. At this point, we just couldn't take it anymore. Our vacation for the 2 days we had been there already had been ruined. We had spend those 2 days arguing and being harrased by the Dunes motel/hotel staff. This behavior is completely wrong and uncalled for and something should be done about it. No customer should be treated like this!!! Every person who we saw that weekend complained about there stay, I am not joking. When we left, we found another hotel and when we explained what happend, the people around even said how bad this place is.

The room was VERY clean and everything was new. I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. It was definitely better than what I was expecting. The staff (especially the housekeeper) was VERY friendly and helpful. She even helped me find sunglasses that were misplaced in the room! Check-in wasn't until 3:00pm but we arrived at 8:00am. The room was still occupied at that time but ,as soon as they left, the room was cleaned for us and we were in by 11:30am. I saw NO bugs at all... and trust me I looked everywhere. The kitchen was immaculate and spotless. The fridge was totally cleaned out, not a spot anywhere. I walked past a room being cleaned out after the people checked out, they were washing out the refridgerator with bleach water. I could smell it. They even supplied the dishcloth, towel, dish soap, and drainer. The bathroom was spotless as well. No mold, mildew, or anything. I have no idea how they get all the sand out of the bathtub after people checkout but they do! :O) If you plan on eating in the hotel room, I would suggest bringing your own food. We brought most of our dry foods but decided to buy the cold stuff in OC instead of trying to fit a cooler in the trunk. Wish now that we'd have brought our own. The prices were high compared to where we're from (WV). The Wal-Mart 4 miles from OC on 50 was not a Super Wal-Mart and had next to nothing in it foodwise... we then went to the Food Lion which is right before the last bridge to OC (about 1/2 a mile from the beach) on 611 and the prices were high. $2.50 for a loaf of food lion bread if you don't have their card. I'm used to 1.00 a loaf at Wal-Mart!! :O) The food at the boardwalk places was very high too. Especially for little things. We ate at Ember's all you can eat seafood buffet and ended up with a $140.00 bill ($30.00 per person). But it was really good. On the boardwalk was an all you can eat buffet called Paul Revere and it was only about $11.00 per person (not $30.00 like Embers). We heard it was good but never got to go there to eat.
