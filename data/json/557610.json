{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not a business hotel My understanding is that this hotel is mainly geared for weddings. The meeting rooms were good size and comfotable for our group but the internet access was limited to the business area in the lobby - 100Y for 15 minutes. Rooms were small and the bed was VERY hard. The hotel was clean and the breakfasts featured a western style as well as Japanese selection. Subway stations were very close as well as the bus service to and from the airport (Narita) was a short walk (Okura) hotel. It was a good bargin although they asked for full payment of the stay when I checked in.Then there were the two earthquakes!!!", "Date": "Aug 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR639429825", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "traveler123Ohio"}, {"Content": "Only if you speak Japanese The Pastoral may be okay as a business hotel for Japanese speakers but was difficult for someone who does not speak Japanese. The hotel staff speak very little English; I could never explain that I needed to check email during my stay. No way to adjust the room temperature so it stayed very hot (even for April). The room was exceedingly small, and the bathroom reminded me of an airplane toilet (tiny and everything plastic). They gave you one thin towel per day. The food was very mediocre. Not an experience I would want to repeat.", "Date": "May 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR407796182", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "bhutan02"}, {"Content": "Good value convenient hotel Stayed here for three nights. The hotel is in a conveneint location, the Imperial Palace is just down the road, and like anywhere in Tokyothe metro system quickly gets you where you need to go. The foyer is impressive and creates a grander feeling to the hotel than it merits.The hotel is spotlessly keen and the staff are very polite and efficient. The breakfast was good with a large choice of both Western and Japanese food - but they seem to eat scrabled eggs cold! The only down side is that the rooms are on the small side - but at 16,000 yenper night I think it represents tremendous value for money. Would definitely consider staying here again.", "Date": "Apr 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR326622545", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Glaws"}, {"Content": "Excellent value for money excellent business class hotel, 4 stops away from Ginza, clean rooms, good service, about 1km away from Japan Prime Minister residence and about 2km from Japan's royal family residence. area is dotted by embassies. nearby macdonalds, convenience store.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR100062090", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066451-d557610-r18587280-Toranomon_Pastoral-Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "557610", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
