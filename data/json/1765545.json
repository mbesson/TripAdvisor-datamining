Other large hotels have some sense of character. This one has no personality at all. It's as though they built an office block, and turned it into a hotel. The entrance and lobby and restaurants are all on different floors. As others have mentioned the reception staff, while polite and reasonably efficient don't seem to understand the meaning of 'hospitality\" i.e. smile, make people feel welcome etc. In this hotel, they feel as though they are processing you into a prison. Parked near the Taxi lobby are a whole lot of expensive old cars -e.g. vintage Jaguars and even an old Rolls or Bentley - but why are they there? Is it supposed to give a sense of grandeur, does the owner live in a penthouse above the hotel? It's all so incongruous.. As for the rooms - I don't like 1970's wood veneer cupboards and bedsides etc. It's just like an old motel which they've tried to turn into a 5 star hotel and produced a characterless place. Beds like stone - if you like a firm bed, you will find this hard, if you like a more luxurious feel - stay somewhere else!! Corridors on the room floors are very dark with little lights -why did they do this, it's just weird.

It was my first time in Hong Kong, and this was a great base from which to explore this awesome city, even though it is a little out of the way.

Concierge would advise that all restaurants are a taxi ride away, and that would largely be true, but we did discover a couple of good options if you like local Chinese food and street food. First, a great dimsum place (open morning and afternoon but not seemingly in the evening), outside the street-level back entrance (turn left). Secondly, the hot food market, can't remember the name of it, but is about 5 mins away, near the building site of the new subway. Also there's a Starbucks the other side of the highway, behind the petrol station, which comes in handy if you're not having breakfast at the hotel.

Our family has visited Hong Kong multiple times, so we knew what we were getting into when we booked a room from Southside of the island. If you are visiting Hong Kong the first time, I would recommend to book a room from the other side (Central-Causeway Bay) island, since the traffic connections from the hotel are rather poor. However, there is an excellent free shuttle service from the hotel, but you are tied to the schedules and route of the shuttle. Taking the taxi from the hotel is not a probelm and it usually costs you 60-80 HKD to get to Times Square or Central, no biggie. In the vicinity of the hotel there are very few restaurants (mainly lunch restaurants for locals), one Starburcks in the next block (closes around 20:00 hrs) and one 7-11 that is not open around the clock. You are pretty much stranded in the hotel. If you are more interested in Stanley (nice beach, nice small market area), Repulse bay or the fish market of Aberdeen, then this hotel offers an excellent location. When the MTR station opens up in 2016, this will all be very different. Ocean Park is literally around the corner, so if you want to spend a few days in Ocean Park, this is definitely a hotel to consider. A word of warning though, if you enter through Main gates, you cannot exit any longer from Aberdeen side, so entry and exit gates are now both located in the same area. Once you have walked through the entire Ocean park area and you have two tired kids (or senior citizens) with you, be prepared to walk back to the train or cabel car to get away from the park. Traffic past the hotel is very heavy, so ask for a room from hill side or from higher floors (15 and above). The scenery is nothing to talk about, no thrills. Service and restaurants vere adequate, but still limited. The staff were very friendly and everything in our room worked, housekeeping sometimes needed some extra encouragement to clean and make our room, but nothing major. The hotel has one breakfast/lunch/dinner area and one small bar. The lounge is strangely right across the reception desk and several guests took it )a very open access) for a restaurant only to discover that you are soon hushed away from the lounge if you have not proper access. Rooms were clean, but small as typically in Hong Kong. All the basic services were available. The interior design of the hotel was dark but beautiful with many small details. So, the price is good, shuttle will get you to the Central for free, Ocean park is around the corner as well as Aberdeen, but for a first time visit in Hong Kong, I recommend to stay closer to the action.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cbig rooms, good base to explore the Islands but otherwise not a very convenient location\u201d", "Author": "mitmit0401", "ReviewID": "UR125851594", "Content": "the rooms are very big by hong kong hotel standard. the lobby design is quite cool, and they do have free shuttle bus service that takes you to airport express station which is quite nice. it's 30 mins away at least so with traffic jam you need to make sure you have budget in the time so not to miss your flight. the location is frankly a weird and it's located in between two factory buildings. i guess this hotel is a factory building conversion. if you don't mind about that this is not a bad place to stay. the room quality is more or less no frills, but i was not expecting anything fancy when i booked this hotel so completely fine by me.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, shame about the noise!\u201d", "Author": "bal789", "ReviewID": "UR125768164", "Content": "I would love to give L'Hotel a great review based on the hotel itself and the quality of the staff. However, I was completely let down by the amount of noise in the hotel during my two week break. Focusing on the positives, the hotel itself is great and the location was not a problem. Having stayed in a variety of Hong Kong hotels closer to central, I was concerned about where L'Hotel was located. However much to my surprise the shuttle bus is extremely convenient and punctual. It only took 10-15 minutes to get to central, which is nothing compared to how long it can take to even get across central! The perks of being in its location were that the hotel was situated in a quiet yet industrial area without the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The staff were informative and polite at all times from the moment I checked in until check out reflecting on the standard of their professionalism. At around 8am every morning the hotel became exceptionally noisy. The cleaning staff insisted on leaving the doors of the rooms they were cleaning open, which caused noise throughout the corridor. Cleaning staff also had a habit of screaming at one another across the hallways which interfered with my sleep. If you're ever looking for a slight lie-in, you won't find it at L'Hotel. I moved rooms 6 TIMES during my two week stay because of a variety of malfunctions including being given a twin room instead of a double and building noise. However, staff were always to accomodate my request and for one night I was even upgraded to a suite. In addition, throughout my stay I was given rooms with a mountain view despite paying for a city view. I do believe there are other hotels in Hong Kong with a much better sleep quality, and more professional cleaning staff.

Seems like a very boutique hotel with many floors and right smack in the middle of an industrial area. Easy to find by cabbies from Wan Chai or Causeway Bay as it tends to be the only hotel in the Aberdeen area. New hotel that is nearby to some places of interest like The Peak, Ocean Park (within walking distance) and Stanley Market. Pros ; Rooms are clean and very up-to-date. Internet speed is good and area tends to quiet down by evening. You can have a full day at Ocean Park and just walk back. Shuttle buses to Hong Kong station or Causeway is great. I didnt have problems with cabs but I would imagine that may soon be a problem to get at the hotel if you miss the shuttle. Light behind the mirror and a magnifying mirror (for the ladies) is a nice touch. Check-in was quick and fast without hassle. I think because the hotel is new, it does not seem busy yet. We did have a bad experience as the bus leaves once its full. Did not expect to get to the waiting bay 10 minutes earlier and was told that the bus to Hong Kong station (going back to airport) has already left. The bus was a 16 seater minibus only. Ended up taking a cab to the airport. Cons ; Food eating places are hard to find from here. Conveniences are at a minimum like 7-11 as it is an out-of-the-way kind of area. The blinds that cover the bathroom is controlled from the room side. I find that baffling, and I dont understand the reason for it. A hotel I stayed at in Macau has the blinds controlled by the bathing person in the shower, not leave the showering man at the mercy of the blind being pulled or open from the room side, albeit by accident. If you take a cab, you have to bear with the Aberdeen tunnel traffic and have to pay the toll charges that comes with it when you go to and from Causeway Bay. Forget about MTRs, none nearby but I think they are building one in front of the hotel. But overall I like this hotel with things like security access and docking stations (iphones of course).

The room was spacious for a Hongkong hotel and the bed was king-sized, not queen, and very comfortable. Free wi-fi was also good. A hotel of same standard in Central or Kowloon would cost nearly double, so it is worth staying here even you pay for taxis everyday. (Of course there are free shuttle services if you\u2019re not in a hurry) Taxi fare to Central area, about HKD60 \u201380, to the airport HKD350 including surcharge. Contrary to other reviews, we found that there are some restaurants and a seven eleven in the vicinity. The hotel is built on a slope, so the main entrance is on the 4th floor (facing Tong Bin Lane to the north), reception desk on the 5th, and the back entrance is on the 1st floor facing Wong Chuk Hang Road to the South. If you go out from the back entrance on the 1st floor, there is a decent Chinese restaurant just next door on your left, open for breakfast and lunch only. If you cross the street from here there is an eatery directly opposite, also open for breakfast and lunch only. If you walk eastward a little toward Ocean Park from here and turn right at the ESSO gas station into a small pedestrian alley, you will find a Seven Eleven on the ground floor of One Island South bldg (3-min-walk). There is also a Starbuck caf\u00e9 in the same bldg. The hotel is quite convenient if you visit Ocean Park. (You can buy entrance tickets at 10% off at hotel reception. Also, the ticket was for two-day entry at the price of one day ticket) The hotel provides shuttle services, but the last one from the park leaves before 8pm, before the sound and light show at 8pm. (which is quite spectacular!!) A large number of people go out from the park at once after viewing this show at about 8:20pm, so it is difficult to catch taxis or buses. But rather than queuing long time for a taxi, you can just walk about 15-20 minutes straight back to the hotel. The only drawback I noticed was that when I bought Ocean Park tickets at the hotel reception and paid by Master Card issued in Japan, they charged in JPY, not HKD, and the conversion rate was very bad.

It was our first trip to Hong Kong. I will start with the cons: (a) I do not recommend this for first timers or families with young kids - the location is too remote (unless you are going there SOLELY for Ocean Park). I read this in some of the other reviews but did not take heed and in hindsight would have picked a more central hotel (even for the higher price). However the hotel does provide a good bus service (refer pros). (b) The closest shopping center/shops area is in Aberdeen which is a 30HKD taxi ride away. Not expensive but as a family with small kids, the lack of immediate access (even to a 7-eleven) was highly inconvenient. The hotel menu items were ridiculously expensive. (c) Room service/cleaning was a disappointment. It was obvious that the cleaners barely spend anytime there - the sheets were never changed and on some of the days, the floor was barely swept! The pros are: (a) Good sized rooms (was expecting to be claustrophobic given all the reviews of other hotels) (b) Brand new hotel - so everything is new . (c) Super-convenient bus schedule to HK Central station (from there you can walk to the Macau ferry terminal, Peak Tram, catch the trams, trains to Kowloon etc) Note: There is a local cooked food market about a 15 min walk away. I would not recommend it for non-Asians as food hygiene did not seem to be of the highest standard across the different stalls I saw.

One of our rooms smelled of mold and when we called to complain, someone was sent to spray air freshener in our room to mask the smell for an hour. We were never offered another room and since it would have been inconvenient to change, we never asked. The hotel breakfast buffet fell flat. The scrambled eggs were seriously undercooked and looked like soup. The rest of the food offered was not of good quality or quantity. There is nothing within walking distance to do, see or buy. The hotel offers an airport shuttle, which we found very prompt. You can take this shuttle to Central Station and from there transfer to the subway. Kowloon is quite far. The subway is very clean and signs are also in English. We took a taxi from the hotel to Hong Kong Disneyland and it was about $300 HK or $40 American.

My expectations were high as the reviews were really glowing. And you know what? I was not disappointed. I printed out a schedule beforehand so on the day we arrived, we waited for the shuttle in front of the Airport Express Station. Good thing I took note of the number of the hotel so while waiting, I called to confirm if the shuttle was indeed coming and good thing I did because the shuttle was downstairs in Level 2, along with the other hotel shuttles so for those who are going to ride the shuttle, wait at LEVEL 2 of the Airport Express Station. There's a place for shuttles there. Anyway, the shuttle was on time and having it helped a lot as the hotel was far from any bus or mtr station. I wouldn't complain about the location of the hotel though because the shuttle made up for it. It was very efficient and on time. You could easily reach Central or Ocean Park through their shuttle service. The hotel itself didn't look like much from the outside but it was beautiful inside. The lobby was bright and elegant. The attendants were polite and we had no trouble checking in. Also, their service call center was really helpful. The rooms were great! What you see in the pictures is what you get. They had complimentary water, coffee, tea and fruits also. They have hairdryers and a gadget where you can connect your ipod to and play music and charge it at the same time. They also had adaptors which were great because the electric sockets were different from the ones at home. The bathroom had a see through \"wall\" but it had blinds so there was no problem. They have bath tubs too! It was great to come home to the hotel after a tiring day and take a long warm bath. We had the hillside view and it was indeed relaxing. We went around the hotel and we saw the pool. It was inviting and there wasn't anyone swimming then but we were too tired so werent able to try it. But it was cool because from the gym you have to take a cute little elevator to get to pool. It was only like a half level down though... haha... Also, the hotel had free wifi which was a great bonus! The only downside was that on our second day, the shuttle to Central had already left so we decided to take the chuttle to Causeway Bay instead. We thought they would drop us off at the Causeway Bay MTR station but the driver stopped at this obscure street instead! Being first time tourists, we wanted some direction so we asked the driver about the way to the MTR station and he SHOOED us away! He refused to answer our questions and so we were forced to alight and he left us there! We could've gotten lost! Good thing we asked around and some friendly people pointed us in the right direction. I can't believe the driver was so unhelpful and rude! That was the only bad thing, though.The other drivers were friendly and helpful. Another plus was that we got our Ocean Park tickets for 10% less at the hotel! And it was for two days! We didnt get to use it the next day though because we went home but still, we were thankful. Also, another great thing was that after we checked out, they still allowed us to leave our baggage with the concierge and we just came back for it when we were ready to go to the airport. All in all, we had a great stay at this hotel and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. I would also be coming back.

Do you want the world famous hustle and bustle of the former British colony or been there done that and now want to see a different side of Hong Kong? Well, you can't go too wrong with Aberdeen which is walking distance from L'Hotel. The Junks have all left now - but you can still guess how it might have looked in the past. And the shopping in Aberdeen is just a little cheaper than the famous Ladies Streets on Kowloon side. So I chose this hotel because of it's rating in TripAdvisor - and you won't be disappointed. Staff very friendly (no snares and no jibes at my broken Cantonese). And the free shuttle bus is amazingly on time true to the timetable (roughly every hour between 7am and mid-night) that will get you to Ocean Park (for the kids) or to Hong Kong station so it's easy to get into the hustle bustle again when you suffer withdrawal LOL. I had the mountain view and I guess it was pieceful but am advised by others on TripAdvisor that the city view is more dreamy. I didn't eat in - preferring the local cuisine in Aberdeen. A few old temples in Aberdeen and Ap Lei Chau Island (Iand the HKD $1.80 harbour short boat ride from Aberdeen to Ap Lei Chau is worth it for a closer look at the bay and its inhabitants). There is a little secret walk hidden up to a valley cut by a river just to the left of Aberdeen Technical School - it's not documented anywhere but a reminder of maybe what Aberdeen was like before people started populating the lower reaches near the bay. It has complimentary WiFi which worked fine for me and allowed me to catch up on some work. The bay windows in my hotel room were very panoramic and everything was so clean and spotless. And I could spread our my arms and there was no fear of touching opposing sides of the room walls as can sometimes be the norm if you are staying down in TsimShaTsui area LOL (been there done that!), What's more my luggage got delayed through a tight connecting flight (I got on but my luggage didn't LOL) - so I was really appreciative of all the bathroom amenities like toothbrush, shaver, etc. on hand.

To Causeway : Taxi only cost $50 to 60 HKD = 8 AUD wow To Aberdeen: Taxi = 30HKD = 4 AUD wow To Stanley Market: Taxi = 70 HKD = 10 AUD To Victoria Park = 100 HKD = 12 AUD Lastly, we have stayed in hotels that is right next to MTR, but by the time we walk through the tunnels we could have caught a taxi for a little more. We will stay there again even without kids. We love it, especially the size of the bedroom. Hope you find this useful. p.s.

Do note that although their website says \"double double\" beds, the beds are actually super single size & not double bed size! We were a family of four so we got 2 connecting rooms. The connecting rooms do not have king/twin bed combos but twin beds only. In one of the rooms the twin beds can be pushed together, the other is separated by a bedside table.

The room had a huge and soft bed, wireless internet is free. Floors were hardwood, not carpet. The rooms are missing some of the bells and whistles you see in new hotels (no Ipod deck, speakers in bathroom, seperate shower stall etc) but as the hotel is not really positioned as a 5 star hotel that is normal. The front desk told me that most of their clients were either going to Ocean Park (very close) or tourist groups (with bus). The reason why I asked is that the hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere. You have a 20 minute walk to the nearest 7/11 and 25 minutes to a grocery store. If you have a car or are part of a tour group it doesn't really matter. Also, there is a bus stop about a 5 minute walk from the hotel that will take you pretty much anywhere and taxis are not too difficult to find. But make sure you know what you are getting yourself into. Very high value (at least now with the price so low) but far away from anything.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Finland", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding service and cozy rooms\u201d", "Author": "DBTT", "ReviewID": "UR74721161", "Content": "The only reason why I did not rate L Hotel Island South as excellent is because I know the price is going to change once the hotel gains its full potential. As a brand new hotel, the prices were only around 500HKD when I was traveling which is some 300-500 below market price and a veritable bargain. I stayed a total of 3 or 4 nights in a few separate occasions and I have been extremely pleased every time. The hotel itself is situated in Aberdeen which is a bit off if you visit Hong Kong as a tourist, but the hotel is right next to a bus stop, the taxis in HK are very cheap and the hotel offers free shuttle bus services to central. The restaurant was not yet operational when I traveled and as such we took a taxi to the heart of Aberdeen to have some nice local cuisine. The rooms are extremely comfortable. As a new hotel, there is nothing bad to say about the rooms and the cleanliness and the look of the hotel itself. 30sqm (ard 300sqft) is well enough for two people and somewhat luxurious in HK. I had both the hillview and the cityview rooms and both have fairly nice views, but nothing too spectacular. What I really appreciated at L Island South was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. If anyone at Island South is reading this review, I would like to express my gratitude for outstanding service that I got each and every time (even the time when I almost PK'd in the lobby and the clerk couldn't stop laughing) The luxurious service along with spacious and cozy rooms make Island South one of the best hotels I have stayed in HK even though the location is not the best.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "hong kong", "Title": "\u201cA comfortable mid-range hotel with a high service standard\u201d", "Author": "sant0224", "ReviewID": "UR67801313", "Content": "We stayed in L'Hotel Island South for five nights. We took advantage of the soft opening offer and paid under 50 pounds per night for a spacious room. Yes, the restaurant, the fitness room and the pool had yet to open, but it was a very comfortable stay nonetheless. The room was spacious, though we thought an extra chair could even be put near the window without making the room look cluttered. We were particularly impressed by the Revo Domino 2 Internet radio set! We loved to be able to tune into BBC Radio 4 and JazzFm! Everything else was just spotless - no complaint. The staff were keen to make sure our stay was hassle-free. They may not have those bright young things manning the reception or the coincerge, but they were all well-trained and put on a geuine smile to greet you. A great thumbs-up for their helpfulness. The location of the hotel may look a little off the beaten track for tourists who are interested in sight-seeing, but it is just a 15-minute ride by taxi to Wanchai or Central on a good day. The bus stop is just outside the hotel and you can get to anywhere on the island by bus. Overall, this was a very pleasant experience and we look forward to our next stay with them.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "L'hotel Island South", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1765545-Reviews-L_hotel_Island_South-Hong_Kong.html", "Price": "$110 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">No.55 Wong Chuk Hang Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Hong Kong</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">China</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1765545", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c5/d5/ea/l-hotel-island-south.jpg"}}
