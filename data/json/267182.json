When I first sat on the bed it was like sitting on a block on cement. It was so hard that when I plopped down, I hurt myself. There is absolutely no cushion, no bounce, no movement to this bed. But surprisingly I had one of the best sleeps I've ever had. It's the strangest thing... The wifi was hit or miss. I asked the front desk to help and they were pretty useless.

What was described as a room that would comfortably house three adults was tiny (perhaps 10 by 12) with a twin and a bed described as a full that was actually a twin with six more inches of width meant to hold two adults. The mattresses were rock-hard and stained with what looked like blood. The fitted sheets did not fit the mattresses. The comforters were almost crunchy in texture. The blankets had something on them that made me sneeze whenever I was near them. I can only hope the mystery substance was a cleaning chemical and not mold, mildew, or worse. I woke up every day with a terrible back and neck ache that required several minutes of stretching and medication. We barely had room to move around in the room, which did not include windows that opened, a clock, closet, or space to stow luggage. We tripped over luggage all week because we each brought out own suitcase and had nowhere to place luggage that was out of the way. The bathroom's size was consistent with the bedroom. The only way two adults could be in it at the same time is if one was in the shower while the other used the sink. The temperature of the shower water was okay, but the water pressure was dreadful. It alternated between fire hose pressure and nothing at all. Like everything else, the towels were too small. They barely sufficed to dry an adult body. We opted to hang the \"do not disturb\" sign all week rather than allow the maids to clean because they turned off the air conditioner despite 95 degree heat.

No, it's not a 4 star but it has a comfortable bed, clean rooms, and friendly staff, I stay in NYC a lot and have never enjoyed my stay as much.", "Date": "November 13, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "surrey", "Title": "\u201cShabby and inhospitable\u201d", "Author": "supercoolandtrendy", "ReviewID": "UR10618338", "Content": "Stayed at the Windsor Hotel with my 15 year old son for 3 nights and can honestly say that in all my travels this was the most awful place I have ever stayed. The area is rundown and there were guys on the street hanging out and drinking beer. It is not the place for a woman to stayalone with her child but i had never been to new York before and the travel agent told me it would be fine! On arrival there was no bell boy and we had to hump our cases up to our room ourselves which was unacceptable as I have mobility problems. The safety deposit box is not fixed to the room and can be carried off by anyone entering the room. The room was small and clean ,but shabby. We had been informed that the hotel had been recently refurbished but we did not see any evidence of this. there was no wardrobe and we had to hang all of our clothes across the back of the chair and rummage through them each morning to select what we both wanted to wear. Also, the curtain was hanging off the window and there was no slip mat in the shower/bath. Im no fattie but the towels wouldnt cover the modesty of a three year old child and they were old and hard. If I had paid budget prices for this stay then I wouldnt be complaining but we paid top dollar for this holiday and not even a cup of coffee in the morning! My son developed really large blisters on his foot from our long walk on day one in Manhattan which were really painful but when I asked for a plaster (band aid) at reception they didnt even have a first aid box. I was appalled by this and had to go into town to find a chemist . It worried me that if either of us became ill or needed emergency first aid the staff were unprepared. The people of New York were nothing like the staff at the Windsor and we loved them. They are the most friendly people in the world and offered us help and assistance on getting about and using the subway on several occasions. We got to know some really cool people and have brilliant memories of our stay. We will definately visit NYC again but will not be staying at the Windsor.", "Date": "November 5, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North East England", "Title": "\u201cshabby\u201d", "Author": "Sunnygirl83", "ReviewID": "UR10374612", "Content": "This hotel is rated as a 4star hotel, there is nothing at all that could bring it anywhere near a 2 star hotel Booked as a double standard, sub standard would be more fitting The room was very small, as was the bed, no wardrobe, the wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the shower took 5 minutes to run hot but was ok then As we were staying for a week we asked if there was a larger room available, credit to the lad on reception who offered us a larger room for a couple of nights but said we would have to swap back again over the weekend, and then could have the larger room back, we looked at the room, which was larger but was really smelly so we declined, the bedding wasn't changed at all while we were there On the plus side if China Town is high on your list this hotel is minutes from there and Little Italy,the subway station is 150 metres from the hotel and very safe and cheap to use", "Date": "October 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cNothing like the website\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3768003", "Content": "Hotel in marginal location, next to a nightclub.

It was a trip that we organised at the last minute and we were being quoted $250 dollars and more (much more) per night at other hotels that had vacancy's. We were a little concerned about staying in the Lower East Side, but we did not have many (any) alternatives and at $150 per night, we decided to go for it. The hotel itself is about average, very clean and the rooms were serviced each day. It is a modern hotel, but it is starting to show some signs of wear. The bathroom is modernish, but I prefer modern over antique charm any day so it was fine. It was necessary to run the shower for a few minutes to get hot water, but once we had worked this out, it was not a major problem. We reported this to the hotel and they say that they are aware of the problem and that they are trying to get it fixed. Having initially been concerned about the area, I can now say that I would be more than happy to stay here again. I particularly enjoyed watching the locals do Tai Chi each morning in the recreation area opposite (sometimes with ornamental swords). It is on the fringe of China Town & Little Italy with a great choice of restaurants bars etc and great shopping is available along Broadway on the way to Soho just a five to ten minute walk away. There is a Subway Station (B&D lines) 1 minute away and another (J&Z) about 2 minutes away. The NYC Subway is very easy to use and runs 24 hrs so we were able to go uptown, downtown and all around town to our hearts content. I understand that a taxi to Times Square is about $10 but we just used the subway. It is a very safe area. We did not feel uneasy at any time. If you pull your tourist guide out of your pocket, one of the locals will come up to you and offer to help you find your way. There was a small grocery store located opposite that was run by some South American people. I think that it also doubled as a kinda social club and we got to know the people there who were friendly & entertaining. The hotel staff were extremely friendly offering advice on restaurants, places to visit, transfers to the airport, really anything was not too much trouble. We enjoyed the area much more than expected. Actually the area and its cultural diversity added to a very enjoyable visit. I would certainly try and stay in this area or Soho when we next visit and if the price is right I would stay at this hotel again. I hope that this helps you when you are planning your visit.", "Date": "April 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3316155", "Content": "My daughter and I stayed here 4th Dec 04 smashing place lovely clean room and en-suite cleaned every day Its run bt chineese people who were lovely and very polite.I was just a bit put off by the area.Its in china town and if you want to spend time in the evenings up in time square you take your chances on getting a taxi back to the hotel.
