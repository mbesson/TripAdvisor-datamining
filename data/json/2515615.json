Great layout for our family. Son slept on the hide-a-bed and my father had his own room and bathroom. Newly remodeled rooms had nice decor. A tiny bit of wear and tear was starting to show already on some wood edges here and there, but very minimal. Very clean. Great to have a nice kitchen. We stocked up on snacks at a local Walmart and also used the fridge and microwave for leftovers from a nice dinner out. This was our home base for 3 nights while visiting Legoland and Sea World. Great freeway access and within a decent driving distance. It was about 35 minutes to Legoland and about 22 minutes to Sea World. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance and the buffet breakfast at the hotel was really nice with a good variety and late enough hours that we didn't have to get up at the crack of dawn while on vacation. I think it went until 9:30am on weekdays and 10:00am on the weekend. The best part of our stay was the pool though. The weather wasn't as nice as we were hoping it would be while in San Diego. Low 60's and some rain, but the pool was so nice and warm that we could still swim... even in the evening. It made it feel like a vacation despite the cold weather. My only complaints were that we were \"offered\" two separate rooms when we arrived instead of the two bedroom suite we had reserved. I explained that the two bedroom suite was the entire reason I chose this hotel. Rather than making me feel like keeping my reservation was OK, I was told about how sometimes those rooms are overbooked, etc, etc and ended up feeling like I was inconveniencing them even though they were able to honor our reservation. I also had an extra double charge on my credit card for one night that I discovered after I got home, and they didn't apply my Marriott rewards nights correctly. With that said, I would totally stay here again. It was like home away from home. The 12:00 checkout was great too. That extra hour is really nice...even if you don't need it. It is just nice to not feel rushed out.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNew, Clean, Spacious, Comfortable and Pet Friendly!\u201d", "Author": "Exploring4Fun", "ReviewID": "UR128074412", "Content": "Loved this hotel; everything seems new and in great condition and good location.

This hotel provided everything we needed for a relaxing vacation in the San Diego area. The location was perfect for us! It is half way between San Diego and Escondido with easy access to the freeway. We were able to move around the area quite easily. It is also just a short drive to southern CA's beautiful beaches. Our room was spacious and extremely clean. It had two big windows that provided a feeling of \"openness\" which is sometimes lost in a hotel room. We had a fully equipped kitchen and a pull out sofa bed in addition to a comfortable king bed and vanity sink outside the bathroom. The breakfast area had a homey feel and was beautifully maintained by the staff. There is comfortable seating, a big screen TV and free use of a computer and printer. Breakfast consisted of a variety of hot and cold items that changed day to day as well as the ever present large bowls of fresh fruit. We were delighted to find a delicious hot meal of lasagna, garlic bread, crisp salad, soft drinks, beer and wine when we arrived hungry and tired after traveling all day from the East Coast. Guests can enjoy complimentary dinner nightly Monday thru Thursday. All outside areas are clean and well cared for and there is plenty of free parking. There is a large gas grill, tables with umbrellas and a heated pool and hot tub. Right next door is a restaurant/cocktail lounge that serves delicious seafood, salads and sandwiches. Within the complex there is a gas station/convenience store and fast food restaurant. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this hotel to business travelers as well as family vacationers. It has everything you need at a affordable price.

When I return after a weekend or week long trip back home (Florida) I am greeted by name and \"It's so good to have you with us again.\" The morning breakfast is very good and has a variety of items to choose from, the ladies working the dining area always smile and asks if there is anything that I need. I will thank them for their service and many times I am told \"oh no, the pleasure is ours and thank you for choosing to stay with us.\" There is a small dinner that is served Monday - Thursday which is good if you don't feel like going out anywheres. Wednesday night is \"Manager\" night and they always grill out hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken. Trent the General Manager is on hand and walks around to talk to everyone and checks to make sure that you are satisfied or what he or his staff can do to make your stay more enjoyable. The housekeepers do an excellent job as my room is always clean. They have even put my dishes away after being washed in the dishwasher so I don't have to contend with that after working all day.

As we were in the process of moving, we had our pets with us and the fact that they were able to stay here was a big plus. The hotel is located approximately 20 minutes from downtown San Diego and its attractions. We made the trip almost daily and only hit traffic during weekday rush hour. If you can avoid these times, you'll barely notice that you're not in San Diego proper... except for the fact that it is significantly hotter. Temps average 15 degrees higher here, but rooms are climate controlled by the guests with a digital thermostat that kept us sufficiently cool. Additionally, the pool was refreshing and virtually empty during the day. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and were pleasantly surprised by its size. The hotel offers studios and two bedroom suites, but I'd recommend the one bedroom over the studio for extended stay guests using the kitchen. Who wants to cook in their bedroom?! The kitchen was equipped with pots, plates, glasses, and various utentils. Dishwasher with detergent provided. No oven, but a small two-burner electric cooktop and a large microwave, plus a full-sized fridge. Breakfast was substantial (eggs, potatos, breakfast meat, pancakes/french toast, waffle maker, plus the continental breakfast options).

Parking was generally good; on one occasion we had to park in a lot that seemed to be shared with the other Mariott hotel in this plaza, Springhill Suites. In the plaza there is also a Chilis and a local seafood restaurant as well as a Wendys. There is a grocery store nearby and if you need them to, the hotel staff will shop for you. My main criticisms of this property were the lack of wireless internet in the rooms (they do have ethernet hookups in the rooms and wireless in the lobby/tv area) and the limited TV channels.
