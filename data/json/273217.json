It's a beautifully designed hotel, steps away from the beach, 5th Avenue and the town's nightlife. The rooms are elegant and cozy - nice touches like azure bedspreads, smooth rock shower floors and in some, fun open lofts with a winding wooden staircase to the bed. The property has a nice open-air pool with a waterfall wall, at the top of which is a roof deck offering a great view. The staff are friendly, worldly and accommodating.

We aren't into the all inclusive thing so once I saw their website and read reviews I knew this was where we wanted to stay. We luckily booked early and got a GREAT room, the garden terrace with a view of the beach and great big deck area. All the rooms are differents shapes and sizes, our friend had a great lofted room and another a regular size room perfect for a couple. A lot of friends from the wedding stayed there, including couples with children and our elderly friends. Our room was cleaned thoroughly everyday. All the front desk staff was friendly, helpful and honest. Our room had a mini fridge which came in very handy. They also have a great, huge rooftop deck I wish we used more. The price was very reasonable and definitely worth it. The decor is warm, welcoming and flourishing with bright greens and flowers. (side note: book your airport transportation with the Kinbe, reasonable price and our driver was waiting for us at the airport, smooth ride to and from the hotel) The location could not be better! To the left is the beach, to the right is the main street, 5th Avenue. We enjoyed the lounging at the Zense (sp?) on their beach chairs. We also enjoyed the cafe past the Starbucks, I believe it's called Sasta, delicious bagels and coffee, much better than Starbucks. The bar kiddie corner from Starbucks was our favorite laid back, grab a night cap kind of a place. We also ate at Fridas a couple times down 5th avenue for lunch. Our dinner at Sur was the best service we had there. We also recommend a day trip to Tulum. It was super easy to catch a shared van/shuttle about 8 minute walk from Kinbe. We opted for a cab back which was about $40, but between 4 of us not bad at all. We explored the ruins and made our way to Playa Paraiso, which is beautiful. Thank you so much to Ian, Elena, Alejandro and the entire staff at Kinbe. You really made our lodging experience relaxing and comfortable. If we're ever back in Playa we'll be sure to stay with you again.

After one day of soggy, tasteless food and beds that were so hard it was like sleeping on the floor we decided to move. The hotels policy was liberal and we didnt loose any money. That was nice. There was really not much evening atmoshere and since I was traveling with a old friend we were bored. Staying is town is the opposite as staying at an all inclusive. The people at the Kinbe are really great. They were laid back and local people. Although two of the people who worked there were Italian. Lots of Italians in PDC! Since my friend is a pilot we were offered the largest room with a second floor area with just enough room for a bed. The first floor area is small but it has a really great balcony. The beach is a one minute walk - maybe 150 feet. We bought some food at the restaurant on the right and stayed there all day. Its crowded buy great people watching. The other rooms are small, even for wuropean standards, like a college dorm room. But the large room was kind of cool. First street is up the road 150 feet as well, so you are in the middle of both primary activites downtown. This is a nice boutique hotel with character. Wi Fi is free but doesnt work so great. If you really need wifi then go up to the corner at Starbucks and pay some crazy money for a coffee, but the wifi is good.

The hotel is within 2 blocks walking distance to the public beach and you can get beach towels from the front desk. When we got there our room was not ready and they upgraded us to the Garden room. We did not like this room, the bathroom toilet wasn't flushing right, it had a very small flat screen tv, a futon, coffee table and the bedroom was upstairs because it was a loft style room. Not very convenient when you have to use the restroom and have to journey down some wooden stairs. We only stayed in the room one night and they put us in the Moody room. This room was nicer and more spacious. There is a rooftop that you can go to that has chairs and tables, but there is no pool and the view isn't that great.

The hotel was clean and nice. The main complaint we had was that the shower had lots of fixture issues. The shower only pumped out cold water and it was hard to get a warm or hot shower. Also the shower water kept spilling out of the shower onto the bathroom and sprayed all over the sink and surrounding area. Inside the shower there all multiple wall mounted showerheads that either don't work or if they do only have a spray of cold water coming out. We also had phone issues. Our phone in the hotel room didn't work the first day. We requested a repair and it was fixed on the second day. But again that night our phone stopped working. The wifi is spotty at best and we had to request them to fix it on multiple occasions. There is no elevator so you have to climb up a few stories of stairs to get to your room. Carrying up our luggage was a hastle, although the front desk man did help carry a bag up. We asked to repair the showerheads and they did attempt to fix them but we still had cold/lukewarm water most days. There were no ocean views. Their is a manmade wall of water which was not turned on most days until around 8 pm or so. It usually was shut off around 10 pm. The AC is a wall unit that worked very well. The bathroom has a european style toilet built into the wall. It frequently would get clogged or require multiple flushes to work. The walls to the next rooms are close by and if you are trying to get rest in the morning you will be awoken from the slamming of the doors of the surrounding hotel rooms.

The staff were very friendly and helpful and always up for a chat, and the room was comfortable without being overly luxurious.

The in room airconditioner was excellent, and the pool looked nice (although we never used it as the beach is 50 metres away!). The only minor thing worth noting was that the water (and especially the hot water) in the shower in our room was only a trickle, not much pressure at all but we didn't really need a hot shower so we didn't bring it up until check out. Breakfast wasn't included but we used the discount vouchers (10% off etc) at the nearby beach clubs and put brekky towards our tab at the club to get a free chair. Oh one thing - we hadn't taken note when we booked and didn't know there was a rooftop terrace until I just read some trip advisor reviews now!

This hotel offers a nice place to stay with style and personality. I stayed in a Moody room which is on the 'earth side' nestled in a lush garden with a beautiful path leading to rustic stairs. The description they use is accurate, it has a treehouse feel. Not for people who need to use an elevator. No balcony and not much light in my room, # 7, which is perfect for me. I use my room to rest and sleep, the remainder of my time is spent on the beach or exploring adventures in food, music, salsa dancing, and pathways to more quiet beaches and cenotes! The shower is rough on the feet as it's made with natural stones, something I got used to easily. No shelves in the shower but I used the sink nearby to hold my shampoo, soap, etc. I woke up fairly early as there are some very vocal birds living in those beautful trees. But even that added to the charm and character of the Kinbe hotel. The other side of Kinbe is 'water'. The rooms are more modern and are near the pool and waterfall-type wall. It's very pretty.

Here I should warn you: never agree for an upgrade especially if your stay is short, even if they promise to move you to their best room. There is no guarantee that you will get the room you were initially offered (it actually happened to us, although I don't complain as the room they finally placed us to was nice and pretty), but the most important thing - you will be \"roomless\" for about a half of the day. They asked us to move out before 12 PM and put our things next to their reception desk and let us move in after 3 PM. We had no place even to change our clothes after the beach. Not the best situation for people on vacations!!! Our first room was very small but nice. It was overlooking their luscious and very beautiful garden. The only thing which bothered me there was the dampness of the room's air, and as a consequence, of our bedlinen and clothing. You will never have a chance to get your towels and swimsuits dry there.

I entered all my credit card information online and received a receipt via email for the charge. Upon arriving, however, I learned that entering my credit card information just reserved a room but did not pay for one, and we were asked to pay for the room at that point. That seemed fine to me but this is where Kinbe gets sly and unless you're paying attention you won't even notice. I gave them my credit card to pay for the room and they gave me a total price in pesos since they apparently have to charge my card in pesos (?, whatever - fine). What really pissed me off is that they used an exchange rate that was obviously higher than the day's exchange rate so my credit card bill in USD is actually higher that what was quoted online. Depending on the day's exchange rate, this could be a difference of $2 to $10 USD per day per room. You can pay what they actually quote you online in USD if you have cash, but who wants to carry around hundreds of dollars of cash in Mexico (or anywhere, for that matter) - that's why I booked and paid online! Not cool, Kinbe - you should know better. 2. The room was way overpriced compared to hotels in playa and neighboring areas. For example, my wife and I stayed in two 4-star resorts in Cozumel and Cancun that were cheaper and worlds nicer than our small, modest room at Kinbe. Yes, Kinbe is definitely charming and has character, but for what they're charging compared to other hotels, I'm sorry, I just thought we would get way more. I would absolutely not recommend this hotel unless they were much more honest and up front about their rates (no nickle-and-diming), and unless they dropped their prices by at least 33%.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location-Great Staff\u201d", "Author": "USgovt-traveler", "ReviewID": "UR56602635", "Content": "Kinbe Hotel is small hotel in the middle of Playa del Carmen's tourist area.

This room is basic, no frills rooms for those who do not plan on spending a lot of time in the room. The desk staff were great and helped us with directions and booking a tour of Chizen itza for $40. They also gave us an extra pillow on request. The beach is less than a block away and the front desk provides towels and a pass to the Wicky beach club. We spend 2 days sitting in the sun, drinking and eating. If you have a crave for a hamburger this is the recommended place (some people gotta have one). Check out was quick with no problems.

The air worked fine and the king bed was very comfortable. The futon was like a futon.

I chose the Garden room (Kinbe offers 4 types), which was a terrible mistake. I understand that this type of room was meant to mimic the rustic, natural feel of a jungle palapa, but our room had ants, flies, and mosquitos. The downstairs half of the Garden room (the living area) is also very tiny - tinier than expected. After two nights in the Garden room, we told the front desk we needed a new room. Unfortunately, the hotel's only availability was in their most expensive room (Rugiada), but at that point we desperately needed a bug-free room, so we said yes. The Rugiada room was much better - bug free, great, spacious shower, and large room overall. My one point of contention here is that even though the only reason we switched rooms was due to a fault of the hotel's (bug problem), the front desk did not volunteer to comp our remaining two nights at the original Garden room price. The difference was only $20 USD, so yes, it's not a large amount, but I hate to say it - it's the principle of the matter. In any case though, to the hotel's credit, the front desk staff were incredibly polite, efficient, and understanding. Overall, I would not stay at Kinbe again. Even though the location is great (right on 5th, and steps away from Zenzi Bar, which is one of the best beach bars in Playa), the prices are too high for what you are getting.

It was small, dark and I could not sell the small half-table, two chairs and beds for five-dollars combined, at a garage sale. Scruffy, scratched, painted horrible furniture. The mattresses were OK. The bedding was leftover Motel 6 as were the towels. The windows had mis-matched curtains that covered your very basic slide bolt locks. The door lock was a button type that a small child could bounce against and open. The safe was a key type but unfortunately was not bolted securely and pulled away from it's anchors. A small plasma TV. Air conditioning was good. My sibling had it too cold for me and it took me two days to get an extra blanket, which was a bed spread from another room, that I finally got by walking into the housekeeping room. Twice Roger couldn't commit to a blanket. There was a phone from 1980-don't know if it worked. No radio or wake-up alarm device. The bathroom was so small knees got scraped while sitting on the commode. The mirror was suitable for children, adults have to crouch. The shower is tiny and numerous bottles of shampoos and soap cakes from previous guests were left on the only ledge- a small four inch space at the shower curtain that could only be reached by feeling around. Yuck. Now the positives: No apparent bugs. In fact the pest control truck was outside one afternoon. The shower head was A+ and pressure was very good. The TV was just fine. Air conditioner good and not too noisy. The courtyard area was nice, filled with flowering plants and whimsy decorative jugs, shells, \"nature\" art, etc. The maids did a good job of cleaning (what they could reach-see shower info.) and were very, very helpful and pleasant.

We had booked the small room as we had not planned on being in it that much as doing trips away. The bed was comfy and clean. Despite the close proximity to 5th Ave you could not hear any noise in the room - which was really good. The only problem the hotel had while we were there were a couple of plumbing problems, meaning the water went off for a few hours. Hopefully they have got this sorted. It would not stop us staying there again. The pool is nice and quite deep although we only saw us using it and that was once after a trip to Tulum. We travalled to Tulum on the local collectivos which are about five minute walk away and are really cheap, better than a taxi or ADO bus. Once there its also dead cheap to get in, but watch out for the time share reps who give you the maps on the way in We did take up their offer to tour a resort up the coast the next day with a free breakfast. The tour and pitch lasts 90 mins and if you can stand your ground against sales pressure like we did, we came out with half price tickets to Xel - Ha, saving $80 - result! Doing a trip to Tulum your self is a lot cheaper than an organised trip and don't combine it with a trip to xel-ha, as most advertise, as there is plenty to see and do at both, too much for one day. We also went to Xcaret booked through Alexis at the hotel. We went for the night show but you get there early enough to enjoy the other attractions as well. The staff were always helpful and available, there is a great roof terrace with views of Playa where we enjoyed a few night time beers before moving to 5th avenue. The hotel has no eating facilities so used the starbucks opposite for breakfast except one morning when we went to Sensai on the beachfront which the hotel promotes use of.

The next morning I woke up at 7:48 (no one had waken me up) so we dressed extremely quickly and ran to the Plaza. We got there at 8:00 extremely tired and luckily the bus waited for us. I didn't missed the excursion but I forgot to put the tickets, the bathing suit (to swim in the Xenote), the money (to buy the cheapest art craft in the area and buy food or beverages), and the sun cream, luckily I didn't forget the camera. Besides that it was very uncomfortable to be the whole day without having taken a bath or washed the teeth. When we got back to the hotel I asked for the receptionist to talk to the Manager, he told us she was busy at that time (19:00) and that he would call us later. At 21:00 we walked down, tired of waiting and the receptionist told us, that we could talk to her (why didn't he call us??). We explained her the situation, and she said that it wasn't that important, because we could go to Chichen Itza anyway, and that there was nothing she could do to solve this problem (she offer as the only possible option to kill the receptionist). That we should relax, and she complained that I threw the keys in the morning to the reception (I was running to get the bus I said) and that the wake up service was not the obligation of the hotel (The hotel says it has the service in internet). We ask for a discount at least and she reluctanty offer a 10% discount. Then I said that wasn't enough and she told me we were taking advantage of the situation. We wanted to leave the hotel, but she asked us to pay the night we had slept there and the following night (because it was later than 12:00 pm). I think the attitude of the administration has been the worst customer experience in my life so I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone. Besides that the rooms are infected with ants, they say it's the tropical weather, but I stayed in other hotels without this problem. Another problem is that I rented an ocean view room and I could only see a tiny strip of sea between the buildings and construction sited, the manager said that it used to have sea view, but they are still offering as an ocean view in the internet.

Our room was beautiful with a new plasma tv, balcony, crisp white sheets, lovely bathroom with little soaps & shampoos, plenty of towels, etc. I would like to address three comments that I have read about this hotel that I don't agree with. Firstly, the bed was the best I have slept on in Playa del Carmen. The mattress seemed new, and was an actual mattress; not the typical bedroll that I've experience in the past at other Playa hotels. It was firm, but not hard. I really don't understand what people were complaining about. We have stayed in Playa 6 other times, and usually stay at the Hotel La Tortuga, the number 1 rated hotel on this website, and I can honestly say that the beds are a hundred times better at the Kinbe. Secondly, we found the front desk to be so helpful and friendly. Fabrizio in particular was awesome! Lastly, we thought that the minibar was not a rip-off. For example, I am reading this from our hotel receipt, we had : 1 can of pringles potato chips 1 corona beer, bottle 1 bottle of sprite soda and in American dollars we were charged $6.09. I don't think that is so horrible. But again, I don't understand what people were complaining about. Overall, our stay at the Kinbe was excellent. Playa itself seems to be getting overdeveloped, way too expensive and too full of people especially at this time of year. But it is the top of the high season, so I probably shouldn't complain about that. I would just like to reassure people that they should have no reservations about staying at the Kinbe.

The hotel was as described ...Kind of a funky little place with lots of the old Playa charm... On the roof terrace you can watch the stars and obsorbe the ambiance of Mexico....(nice) We found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful.

Most good hotels in the Playa area are the 'closed-resort' type, which I wanted to stay away from in order to get first-hand experience of Mexico. Hotel Kinbe seemed to be the best fit for this requirement of mine - it was located one block from the Playa del Carmen beach and one block from the main street with all the restaurants, shops and bars. Location is probably the hotel's absolutely best feature. The hotel is difficult to describe in words - everything in seemed to be handmade, including steps, bed, bathroom, front desk, lampshades... except for the windows, the AC unit, and the shower curtain(?). It was primitive but for some reason, very charming (and I dont get \"charmed\" very easily, especially by 2 star accomodations). We booked a junior suite, which esentially is a small size room (the 'normal' rooms are very very very small) - the price was something like $40 a night, which is also the cheapest I have ever paid to sleep somewhere. The only thing I was unprepared for and disliked was the very strong musty smell of mold... we had to buy an air freshner spray and spray real hard before entering the room every time to SOMEWHAT choke the smell. The hotel staff is esentially 1 front desk person, polite and with a good command of of English. Nothing to write home about, but no negatives to share either. I am not sure if I will ever choose to stay in Kinbe again, but to me, it still brings good memories for some reason. For travellers on a budget, who know what to expect and are fine with it, it may be a great choice. PS - If you rent a car from Cancun (Playa is a 1hr easy drive from Cancun), you can use it for daily sight-seeing trips from Kinbe. Street parking is usually not a problem. I recommend visiting Xel-Ha, Xcaret (definitely see the show at park close!) and Tulum.

They did recieve a city noise ordaniance while we were there but it seemed to only curb the noise for a night or two. Also there are two construction sites right next to the hotel. One accross the street and the other on the opposite side of the building. Between the loud music and the construction it was difficult to get a good nights sleep. One particular night, the hotel had recieved many complaints from other guests I was told, was when there were some people working on a front door for the currency exchange that was located on the back side of the same building. Hammering and sawing until about 1am. The hotel only offered an appology and a handshake. I understand that this was not the hotels fault but it was the fault of the people that ran the currency exchange. Nothing was offered, and it seemed like nothing was done to accomodate the fact that my wife and I, and many other guests, were not allowed to sleep for most of the night. Customer service skills were lacking by management during this ordeal. Lastly, our package deal included round trip to and from Cancun airport. They never picked us up to bring us to the hotel when we first got there. We had to take a Van transport (which dropped us off 6 blocks from the hotel) and had to pay $18.00 US, which we were never compensated for.

We stayed 2 nights - one night at a standard room (USD 6X) and another night at an executive room (USD 8X). The hotel made such arrangement because standard room for 2nd night is fully booked. I now can explain why some of you said the hotel is tidy and clean but some said it is poor. In the room we stayed frist night, this is with a new split-type air-conditioning unit - the machine is efficent and new. Although both the toilet and bedroom floor is initially wet (make you very uncomfortable when you step in the room), the sleeping environment soon turns acceptable when you set the A/C on. The cleaniness of wall, floor, small table and toilet is also acceptable when considering the price is USD6X, although the room is really very small (the bed is small but still good for Asian People like us) . However, when we changed to that executive room next night, the situation is completely different. The window type A/C (obviously old type), the wall decoration (color defading and nearly falling down), toilet status, etc. are OLD and DIRTY. Also, because of the old A/C, the whole room has a bad smell... And this room costs us even higher - USD8X! When wandering around Playa De Carmen, there is really a lots of hotel to choose with a cheaper price too. So, don't believe solely in the hotel recommendation of Lonely Planet, Year 2005 upto now, there is already lots of changes - said so, because this is true even in other places of Mexico. I won't recommended this hotel.

We loved our room, #19, the rooftop deck, the location, the housekeeper and well we loved most things about the hotel.

Yes you have to put toilet paper in the garbage but you have to do this everywhere in town. The places that didn't request it seemed to always be clogged and overflowing. That is the sewer system in a mexican town not a U.S. city. Each day our housekeeper came and folded our clothes that were strewn all over the room from late night parties and wrapped up jewelry in safe location!

Yes, I won't only because I don't like to stay or eat in the same place twice but would suggest others give it a chance. By the way, Playa is great but go down to Tulum beaches if you can.

We paid $80.00 per night and expected cleaner rooms at that rate. There was a musty smell in our room, #11 and black mold spots on the bathroom wall, shower curtain and on the built in shelf next to our bed. On our second night there we were awakened by a loud explosion as a car caught fire as well as the beachfront Blue Parrot Hotel Bar and Hotel Costa Del Mar, just across the street from the Kinbe, burned to the ground. We opened our door to glowing sparks and debris which landed on the roof of the Kinbe. My sister let the employees hook a hose up to her sink and we helped get the hose to the roof where small patches of the thatched roof were catching fire. At this point, we felt our safety was threatened, so we packed our bags and headed to another hotel 4 blocks away where the rest of our family was staying. Once our luggage and documents were safely there we headed back to the Kinbe. The air was extremely thick with smoke and burning our eyes, in short uninhabitable. Soon after arriving back at the Kinbe the police told us to evacuate as we sat on the hotel steps. We stayed the night with our family at a cost of $60.00 for all 4 of us( a very gracious rate, thanks to the Hotel La Tortuga). We returned to the Kinbe the next morning and asked them to refund the $60.00 that it cost us to stay elsewhere. To make a long story short after a few days of stalling they refused to pay the extra money that we were out. This seems like a pretty selfish way to make money considering we had stayed behind and helped to keep their hotel from burning down. The manager not only refused the refund, but was very rude stating that we should have talked to her instead of listening to the police, but we had never met her before then, so didn't recognize her in the confusion of a fire. On our third night I finally had to ask for clean glasses in our room since the same extremely filthy ones had been there since we checked in. The view from the roof was the only saving grace of this hotel, but the beachfront local also meant loud techno music until at least 4 a.m. kept us up all night.

The rooms were a nice size and the beds were comfortable. we stayed in an executive room but would have been just as happy with a standard room as the only difference was the size of the bed. The shower was nice and strong and the water hot, the bathroom is also a good size. The hotel is not on the beach but its is a 2 min stroll at the bottom of the street. The air conditioning works really well and gets rid of the slightly damp smell that was in the room when we arrived. all in all I was very happy to sleep off my jet lag in this friendly and welcoming hotel, definitely a good choice!", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gaston,SC", "Title": "\u201cKinbe was a great choice\u201d", "Author": "cop0251", "ReviewID": "UR4155511", "Content": "We had stayed at large resorts in Cancun and Puerto Rico and were looking for something as a quick vacation and not too pricey. We looked at several small hotels and non-AI places to keep looking at the charming Kinbe. We saw the small rooms and have experienced Mexico before, we booked our trip through Travelocity for a grand total of $1045 we were on our way to Playa for 5 nights. We arrived at Kinbe and checked in with Elena she let us look at a couple rooms to see which one we wanted. The first room was the two level room didnt want to climb steps to get to the bed. Then our original room which was not a king bed, then our king bed room which we paid an extra $20 a night for. It was just a king bed, small table and chair, and a bathroom. This was all we expected for our @$60 per night. We were pleased with the hotel completely. This is a great value in a great little town which is growing way too fast. We hope to go back soon, hopefully in May'2006. Thanks to Elena and the staff at Kinbe our stay was great.", "Date": "November 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lexington, KY", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "skivob", "ReviewID": "UR4149392", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Kinbe.

I used to like the more calm atmosfere found in Playa than the spoiled one of Cancun or West coast of Mexico, Acapulco, etc.. We did a bit of do it yourself so I found the hotel Kimbe through an Italian travel agent that has a dedicated web site about Playa del Carmen, then looked up some reviews on the tripadvisor about this hotel that looked OK so we decided to book it through this travel agent. We knew that hotel Kimbe had small rooms but it was close to the beach on 5ave. so it was enough. Thanks to a review found on tripadvisor we found out that the best room was the junior suite number 6 so we booked that one in particular, the #6 with confirmed e-mail and fax. The trip: After a long trip from Europe we arrived in Miami to catch our connection to Cancun. Here after more than an hour long waiting in a cue for to go through the US Immigration we finally made it to our gate to catch the Mexicana air conection to Cancun. Arrived in Cancun we found our luggage zipper locks broken, cut with pliers, and found inside the luggage a note from the US Miami airport security, that have inspected our luggage during the transfer, because thei scanner could not read it well!?!? we only had shoes and diving goggles inside. Plus all combination locks can be safely opened with a method that airport security should have. The luggage was now permanently damaged and not usable any longer. Mexicana told us that they were not responsible for this as the US security did the inspection. So we had to buy one new luggage for the return trip. \"---\" Playa del Carmen: Once arrived to the hotel Kimbe here we found the surprise, the junior suite #6 was not available beacuse occupied? so they gave us the one above, under the roof. 1st.the aircondition was old and extremely noisy when running. 2nd. the room was dirty and smelly, but after such long trip we decided not to argue anymore and just go to sleep. During the 1st. night we woke up several times during our sleep due to some kind of roaches climibing on our faces, not a nice feeling. The day after once we showed the, promptly killed, roaches to the manager she said, \"OK they are not roaches they are wood insects\", well it does not matter which kind of insect they are when they wake you up in the middle of the night because their legs tickle your neck or face. After a log argument with the manager about the room, that also costed 95USD per day (without breakfast), we managed to move to our original boked junior suite #6, as the people there were living that day. This room was nice and cleaner I have to say, but for 95USD x day it is definitely too much. Still the cleaning lady was not cleaning the bathroom properly, the service was really lousy. The place \"Playa del Carmen\": a shock! prices in general tripled after 7 years, and the Reality Business took over cementing appartments everywere. One could see that the Cancun or Acapulco style had started to take shape and ruin that place. Not anymore a little and quite hideaway. We'll never go back to Playa del Carmen or Mexico. For those that still have to discover it or conveninet because living in the Usa, and look for quite places to relax, we suggest to find small places along the Yucatan coast, south, such as Akumal, or other little villages away from the commercial areas. An all inclusive package it turns out to be much cheaper than just renting a room. I hope I have not been to tragic but we have been travelling a lot in the Caribbean and Mexico areas for both pleasure or business and during this recent trip we saw the changes in that particular area of Mexico. We want to thank again Tripadvisor for the help has given us when travelling around the World.", "Date": "November 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "HOUSTON, TX", "Title": "\u201cLoved this cute Hotel\u201d", "Author": "jessann98", "ReviewID": "UR3746250", "Content": "My fiance and I went last October.

We went to Chichen Itza...wow! That was awesome. The hotel is very very close to the beach. I rec. this place to anyone looking to take a vacation and not spend too much $$. Restaurants are as expensive if not more than restaurants here. Playa is a touristy place. you will find a TGI Fridays there. :( I expected 5th avenue (main street) to have vendors at \"Mexico prices\" nope...they wont even bargain with you.
