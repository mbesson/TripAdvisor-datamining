Due to the situation that the apartments have simple glas windows the noise from the street is annoying. The apartments are ok and have lots of space, small bathroom without an hairdryer (can be requested from reception). Small kitchenette butwith loud fridge. We switched it off. Front desk is only working Mo-Fr till 18:00h. So when you have a problem then you have to phone. They offer a small breakfast room with a buffet which is ok for the price of \u20ac 9,90. WIFI available but its not free, they charge \u20ac 2,- per hour. So in comparison to the price its ok when you accept the noise.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "athens", "Title": "\u201cHOTEL OF THE LAST RESORT\u201d", "Author": "nikolakisx", "ReviewID": "UR65371751", "Content": "Hotel very noisy located on a main avenue and subject to constant car noise all night.

It is set on a main road lined with trees, a residential area. The apartment had a t.v and hi-fi equipment also. 2 minutes from the underground which was an excellent way to get around Berlin. For anyone going here from the Airport the best way is by S-ban train to Zoological Gardens and then transfer to the underground U9 to Theodore Hauss Platz. We will definately go back next year.", "Date": "May 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cGood, low-price accommodation for independent travellers\u201d", "Author": "Thorpe123", "ReviewID": "UR2265629", "Content": "We stayed in the Apartcity Apartments for 4 days in June/July 2004 and enjoyed our time there. The one-bedroom flats (about 40 square metres) have a separate kitchen, bathroom and balcony and were built in the 1950s. The main room is spacious, bright and airy. Kitchen and bathroom fittings were probably taken over from previous permanent tenants and hence vary in age and quality. The kitchen contains standard fittings and a few essential items (crockery, cutlery, coffee-maker, kettle), but again, there is some variation from one apartment to the other. Also the furniture (including a desk) varies, with some items being new and of good quality and others showing signs of wear and tear. However, considering the low price of 50 Euro per night, we didn't bother too much about this. Bed linens and towels were spotless and also the bathroom was clean. Some pieces of furniture could have done with a bit of dusting, which however was not problematic. The location of the Apartcity is in Charlottenburg, close to the International Congress Center. The Underground Station (Theodor-Heuss-Platz) is about 300 metres away. The Underground takes about 10 minutes to get to the main train station (Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten.) Adjacent to the Apartcity is a shop that sells drinks of all kinds, and other shops (bakers, supemarkets) are in the vicinity. We found the location very favourable and would book this accommodation again at any time. It can certainly be recommended to independent travellers who do not require the services of a hotel and prefer their privacy. On the other hand, cleaning and changing towels is only done once a week. An extra set of towels is available for 4 Euro.
