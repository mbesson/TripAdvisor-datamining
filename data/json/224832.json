When my daughter reacted to the chlorine in the pool (she has sensitive skin) I had to take her to take a shower, and we had to wait for 15 minutes in the lobby to get towels for our room. We were still pretty wet from the pool, and it was February and pretty cold when the door kept opening. We got a few towels, but the line was growing for room towels. A while later my husband went to get more towels for the rest of the family, and they only had 2 left and plenty of people still needing them, and still no housekeeping. We also had a smoke detector in our room with no batteries, and had to keep going back to get pillows and blankets for the pullout couch.

So when planning a trip to Indianapolis for the first time I came here first to look for the best place to stay. Location and price were my first concerns. There were several good hotels to choose from but this one seemed to be the best all around choice. We were visiting friends, plus attending a event at the Fairgrounds and this seemed to fill the bill. We were planning on checking in a little later than normal so I called ahead that day to make sure that wouldn't be a problem. The gentleman who answered assured me that they would be holding our room for us. Later When ready to check in we found the hotel easily and within close proximity to our friends home. When greeted at the desk at check in everything was pre-set for us and check in went very quickly. The lobby was very nice, and it seemed the building was rather new, I'm thinking probably no more than 5-7 years old. We were placed on the fourth floor, but there was a convienent elevator just down the hallway from the front desk. I liked that we were higher up as it seemed quieter, even with our room being to the front of the building. The room far exceeded our expectations. Very nicely appointed, with large closet, complete with iron, ironing board, wash basket and safe. The bathroom was adequate and very clean with the usual soap, body cream, shampoo, etc. Next to the closet was a microwave and small refrigerator, with coffee maker and supplies, two bottles of water and some nut bars. The room was laid out more like a small apartment with very good use of space. A large and comfortable King size bed was close to the window with flat screen TV and Blu ray player. The front part of the room closest to the bath had a longe chair with ottoman, small end table with magazines and writing desk with online hookup there. A notebook gave you all the info needed to access their Internet system. Decorations were done very tastefully with many pillows on the bed and a down comforter. I liked the idea they didn't use a bedspread, as those can be seldom washed and I always fold those back completely and put out of the way. Their TV offered a assortment of options: games, recent movies, childrens programing, and your standard TV. The movies were a little pricey ($10.99) so we opted not to view them. There was breakfast offered in the morning but we opted not to use it. A also added bonus was that they also accepted our AARP discount so the cost to stay here was very good. The following morning it was easy to access the Interstate and also gas up before getting on the road to head for home. For a one night stay I was sorry I wasn't going to stay longer. This is the second Wyndham hotel we have stayed at in a month and they certainly are making \"believers\" out of us.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "LittleBread", "Title": "\u201cA hidden Gem with personal touch\u201d", "Author": "LittleBread", "ReviewID": "UR119943638", "Content": "This hotel was a choice for a business trip.

I had a good experience. My flight came in early and I was able to check in at 12:30pm as oppose to waiting until 3:00pm. I originally requested a top floor room - I didn't like the smell of the 4th floor hallway when I got there. I asked the front desk clerk for another room on the main floor - which smelled much better. He was happy to change it for me. The room was a nice size - 2 queen beds, desk, lounge chair, flat screen tv, mini fridge, microwave, and safe. The bathroom was clean - however there was no fan in the bathroom. The breakfast was minimal - coffee, dry cereal, some scrambled eggs, etc. They did have a waffle maker - which is fine if you like that sort of thing. Its not the filling up breakfast - just more of the \"on the go\" type thing. The location of the hotel is a little off the beaten path - there is a mini shopping center with a Starbucks and Quizno's there. There was a Bob Evans across the way - but not walking distance. I ended up traveling a few exits down to Cracker Barrel, Fridays, Chillis - and also a Target. The checkout was very easy. The staff was friendly. Of the 4 nights I stayed they did not clean my room just one time when I was there, and I believe it was just a miscommunication between myself and housekeeping. The next morning they were there bright and early. Note: they start cleaning the rooms very early -8am - If you remember to put out the \"do not disturb sign\" the night before - that is helpful if you sleep in.

Due to last minute flight delays I was unable to arrive that night. I was not able to arrive until the second night. My cancellation policy was 6pm so they had all the right to charge me for that first night. I called around midnight that first night and advised the front desk that due to flight delays I would not be arriving until the next day. They gladly cancelled the 1st night and did not charge me for it...GREAT! I finally got to the hotel the next day at around 12pm but their check in time was not until 3pm. I decided to see if I could check in early and they had no issues with that. After the 24 hour airline ordeal this meant the world to me. I went to my room (427) and was very pleased to find a very large and clean room. Also there were a couple of bottles of water on the table, not cold but nothing my fridge couldn't take care of. The bed was extremely comfortable! I then went down in the morning to get a coffee and could not help but notice the variety in their breakfast. I usually do not take advantage of the breakfasts (just coffee) at the hotels I stay at but I could not help but make myself a waffle. Lets just say I messed the waffle up and made a mess of the machine. The lady in the breakfast room was great and helped me clean it up. If the experience could not get any better, I noticed my flight out of Indy was not until 3:30pm. I went to the front desk and asked if there was anyway i could check out late and told him I did not need to go to the airport until 1:00pm. They had no issues with me checking out until 1pm...at no extra fee. The only thing this hotel is missing is an airport shuttle.

Unfortunately this is where the word good ends. Let me preface this review with the fact that I am extremely allergic to cigarette smoke. I had called early in the day to confirm with the hotel that I would need late check in. They replied that I would be fine as I had confirmed the room with a credit card. I arrived at the hotel and checked in. I was comforted to see a sign on the hotel desk stating this is a non smoking facility. It is about 11PM and I am tired from the long drive. I checked in and proceeded to my room. Arriving at the elevator a couple gentlemen stated, \u201cYou are in for a real treat. The hotel is filled with a bunch of 12 year old girls and it is a zoo.\u201d The hotel was filled with softball teams in town for a tournament. Arriving to our floor I walk down the hall to find my room. A group of parents and their children were sitting on the hallway floor being extremely loud. They continued to sit as we tried to maneuver around them with our luggage. I entered my room and the extreme smell of cigarette smoke hit me in the face. I called down to the desk and asked to change rooms. \u201cI booked a non smoking room and the room reeks of smoke\u201d I said. They proceeded to tell me that no other rooms were available. Nothing I said helped and nothing further was done to accommodate. I left the hotel to get some air freshener to try to make it bearable. The hotel is not in a nice part of the city we were a little nervous being out at the late hour in this area. I ended up sleeping with the window to the room open to make the air breathable for us. This helped only marginally and you can imagine how uncomfortable this made things as it was 20 degrees outside. At least now we could breathe some fresh air. It is now around midnight. The group of parents and children proceeded to do whatever it was they were doing in the hallway until about 1:30 AM and were very loud! Repeated calls to the front desk had no effect. Waking up with a sore throat and bloodshot eyes \u2026 I proceeded to the front desk. I requested a new room. I was still not able to switch rooms so I canceled the next nights stay and was forced to find another hotel. I was able to thank goodness! The hotel did credit the charge for the nights stay, but not willingly. I feel this was not enough for the night we had to endure. On the positive side the hotel was in decent condition and the free breakfast was good. The countless hotels I have stayed at over the years this is among the worst nights stay I have ever experienced.
