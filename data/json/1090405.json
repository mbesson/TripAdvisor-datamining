{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A room with a view of baseball stadium I spent a night at Nion Seinenkan with my 6 year old son. It locates near Jingu baseball stadium. There was a game Hanshin Tigers vs Yakult Swallows on that day , and we could see the game from our room. There is a sento( public bath ) in the hotel, and I bathed with my son. There were no other guests bathing there in the early evening, maybe everyone went to the stadium to see the game. There are not many things other than stadiums around the hotel. But the price is reasonable for Tokyo area, I recommend this hotel for family with children.", "Date": "Sep 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR409729682", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Gintoki"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d1090405-r20262896-Nihon_Seinenkan_Hotel-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "1090405", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
