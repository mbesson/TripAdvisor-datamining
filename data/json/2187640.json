We arrived late at night due to flight timings and were NOT met with a pleasant welcome at this hotel. Not the best start to our stay, however the room we had was basic but clean and the breakfast provided was good. No bar for a late night or early evening drink but it doesnt say there is a bar on the hotel information - so dont expect one!!! Its in a good area for visiting Berlin and the city has a great transport system so getting around is really easy. The Christmas markets are very good and there are many things to see and do. We probably wouldnt stay here again. The hotel receptionist we encountered should seek alternative employment as the first impression she gave to us as visitors was not good at all", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for visiting Berlin\u201d", "Author": "batmaing", "ReviewID": "UR121969191", "Content": "I booked several nights at Lebensquelle Hotel for 3 people and was very pleased with my stay. Across the street are several sections of the Berlin Wall. Down Zimmerstra\u00dfe near Charlottenstra\u00dfe (5 minutes walk) is a stelle dedicated to Peter Fechter. 5 minutes past that, on Friedrichstra\u00dfe is Checkpoint Charlie. About 5 or 10 minutes or so past that on Niederkirchnerstra\u00dfe you can find a long section of the Berlin Wall and the Topography of Terror Documentation Center. Then, about 5 minutes up on Axel Springer Street you have Spittelmarkt tube station. The point of this list is that this hotel is a wonderful \"home base\" for your trip through Berlin. After a long day through the city, you are welcomed with a spacious (the 3 person room, anyway), clean, and warm room. I personally had a great rapport with the staff, despite the language barrier for some staff members; nothing a lot of pointing and nodding and key words can't fix. If you're looking to \"live it up\" in a hotel room, however, Lebensquelle admittedly is not going to serve this purpose. But why do that when there's so much to see outside!", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cIf you like rude staff, stay here.\u201d", "Author": "samsig", "ReviewID": "UR120830330", "Content": "I don't care how clean the hotel is or how good the breakfast is - this is the place to be if you're interested in being served - or as it were, not being served - by staff so shockingly rude, who while away their evenings chatting on the telephone in Russian while staring at you blankly and wondering what reason you could possibly have to dare interrupt their social calls, all the while pretending that they don't speak English so they don't have to deal with the nuisance that you are. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. There are many other equally-priced hotels in Berlin where you will be better off. The service is so unbelievably bad at this hotel that it has spurred me to sign up for a Trip Advisor account in order to write this review. With an unemployment rate rapidly approaching 20% in this city, the snarky receptionists at this hotel would be well-served to learn some manners and basic customer service!", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cCheap option, but wouldn't stay there again.\u201d", "Author": "Astra_TheatreLover", "ReviewID": "UR120416256", "Content": "We arrived outside the hotel at 8.30 at night, and we had a bit of trouble finding the entrance as the main entrance seemed abandoned and locked. After a few moments of looking around we realised that the hotel was at the 5th and 6th floor of the building- therefore the hotel wasn't at a building as a whole as one would expect. We went at the reception and noone was there!! We waited at the reception for 40 minutes and devastated we thought of leaving the hotel and look for another one before it gets too late! Finally a woman came (again after 40 minutes of waiting) and she wouldn't even speak English, so we had trouble communicating with her about basic questions such as breakfast times etc. Having had a really bad first impression we finally arrived at our hotel room. We were relieved that the room was nicely decorated and clean. However, our room was next to the breakfast room and our sleep quality in the morning wasn't as good, as we could hear the people in the next room on a great extent! The breakfast buffet though was delicious and rich.The room service was good however, the staff wasn't very friendly- they were helpful at times however sometimes we just didn't feel welcome! Our expectations were greater as the professional pictures presented on the hotel's website were slightly misleading. Our first impression was beyond negative and the service didn't not rise our expectations afterwards. This was a cheap option however I wouldn't stay there again.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK&Russia", "Title": "\u201cBasic clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "KoshKoshka", "ReviewID": "UR120281464", "Content": "Stayed in this hotel for a few nights. The rooms are pretty basic, you get what you pay for. However, the are very clean and the breakfast was fine. The hotel seems to be fully managed by Russian people so you get a Russian salad olivier for example for breakfast or sandwiches with caviar. It is around 20 mins walk to Alexanderplatz and the same to Gerdarmenmarkt. So basically you are close to everything but not exactly next to anything. It is about 7 mins walk to the metro station Spittelmarkt too.
