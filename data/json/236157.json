Hotel Alimandi via Tunisi is located very close to the Vatican, transportation, shops, and restaurants. We walked to St. Peter's Square everyday, sometimes, several times a day. Our room was cozy for a triple, but met all of our needs and was very quiet. The complimentary internet was down, for most of the week, but Mr. Alimandi used the main computer to book a driver for our day trip to Assisi. The delicious breakfast buffet was served in the sunroom on the rooftop and had a variety of hot and cold foods. It was much more than pastries and coffee. Chef Francesco even prepared our breakfast early, on our day of departure. He was delightful! The hotel has a lovely collection of art, made by an Alimandi family member, for the guests to enjoy.

It's harsh to call it a 3 star hotel, when it offers service, cleanliness and overall hospitality that far surpasses other 4 star hotels I have visited before. As other reviews indicate, the staff there are very friendly, courteous and helpful. My family were welcomed warmly and settled very quickly, and this hospitality I think should be an important consideration in choosing a hotel. This star quality cannot be found in many other hotels, I can assure you. I was only provided with breakfast from the hotel, so had to find other restaurants and take-aways for the other two meals of the day. Although, I must mention the breakfast was buffet, so I was all too happy to indulge myself in the large variety available. You sit on a large balcony, which was refreshing on an early morning. The room is spacious and the beds are comfortable. The walls are nicely decorated by paintings actually crafted by members of the Alimandi family. The bathroom is has a very ingenious double shower in which the cleanliness is maintained daily. In the lounge on the ground floor, there is satellite TV (which provided us entertainment on our last day before we left) but each room has its own standard italian freeview television(the best channel on this is Eurosport which is in English :D ). The windows have good sound-proofing so sleep quality is excellent. This helped us to be ready for our long walking adventures around Rome in the morning. There are many things to do within the hotel too. It has its own Wi-fi connection, which used to be at expense but is now free of charge. There is an Internet room on the bottom floor, but the Internet can be accessed from anywhere around the hotel. I used my Ipod in the hotel to research the places I wanted to visit, how to get there and their costs. To add, their is a pool table and a gymnasium full of equipment. (I didn't really use it much myself :S ). Finally, there is a grand piano. The hotel itself is very ornately decorated with Roman sculptures, paintings and more. Finally, there are very detailed maps available at the front desk to help you with your exploration of this great city. The location of this hotel was absolutely sublime. It's practically on the border with Vatican City, which is an immense tourist destination for those in Rome. The Vatican Museums including the well-known Sistene Chapel is simply up a flight of stairs, then across the street. You can even see the museum from the breakfast balcony on the 4th floor. Also, the famous St. Peter's Basilica is five minutes down a few wide easily traversable roads, along the border of Vatican City, which we visited quite a few times during our trip. To be right next to these is a great advantage because (if you wake up early) you can queue up to enter them and beat many of the other tourists to those destinations, particularly because queues get quite long, even in the late morning and afternoon. The Metroline was very helpful facility on our trip to various different places of interest. This hotel is quite close to the prime station \"Ottaviano\", which is around 500 metres away or a 6 to 7 minute walk. From there you can visit a multitude of various places, some which I will list here now: - The Spanish Steps - \"Spagna\" - The Trevi Fountain & The Pantheon - \"Barberini\" - Colloseum and Circus Maximus - \"Colloseo\" or \"Circo Massimo\" - Saint John Lateran Church - \"San Giovanni\" The Metro is very cheap and easy to use. We found ourselves using it a lot because we wanted to get the most out of our trip by travelling to as many sites as possible. For me, I also enjoyed how cool it was inside, out of the harshness of mid 30's temperatures. There are a vast array of shops in the hotel's vicinity. The area is littered with souvenir shops because the hotel is so close to these tourist destinations. In the back streets around our hotel, there are many restaurants to go to. I mostly had pizzas my time there. An important tip to remember is that the longer the queue for these restaurants/take-aways, the better the quality of the food, so it's better to queue up for these ones. On one corner, there is an ice-cream shop called \"Old Bridge\" which has monstrous queues, but is reportedly one of the best ice-cream shops in the world, well worth going to. Therefore, it leaves me to report that this is a great hotel, undeserving of a lowly 3 stars quality, but because it is so, it provides amazing value for money. It's excellent location makes it a no-brainer for global sightseers, Christian pilgrims and Italian tourists alike.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "Lotois", "ReviewID": "UR117069101", "Content": "After a disastrous 'B and B' experience on the adjacent via Goletta we managed to get a room for 3 nights at this hotel and were delighted that we were able to stay here.Signor Alimandi and all his staff were simply brilliant...friendly,courteous and ever helpful.The hotel is vary clean,the air conditioned rooms perfect and the breakfasts delicious and catering to all tastes....bacon,eggs,cold meats and cheeses,cereals,yoghurts,pastries,cakes....you name it and it is here and of high quality.Located opposite the steps leading to the Vatican museum entrance and with a few restaurants and a Carrefour practically on the doorstep.Metro and buses are all within a 5-10 minute stroll.This hotel also provides free WiFi and a games and exercise room.Basically it is a terrific,non-corporate hotel with a soul and the icing on the cake is not only the location but also and especially Signor Alimandi and his staff.....can't wait to return.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cHotel Alimandi Tunisi-friendly staff but nothing like a 3 star hotel\u201d", "Author": "mitchwonder", "ReviewID": "UR94148656", "Content": "We stayed at Hotel Alimandi Tunisi, not Hotel Alimandi, and only stayed one night moving to another hotel the second night.

Its situated just over the road from the Vatican Museum. We flew with Ryanair from Stansted and once again was surprised at how easy and good this was. We booked the private transfer provided by the hotel for 50 euros. This was quite welcome and very professional. The driver was waiting for us and we were treated to a luxury Mercedes mini bus which was lovely. One tip however is that for the return journey you can get a normal Rome taxi which is just as efficient for 30 euros. On arriving at the hotel we were booked in super quick and assigned our room. We had booked a quad room and when we opened the door (room 305) we were absolutely blown away. The room was amazing, two huge double beds, a massive room, a little corridor leading to a private balcony, and a bathroom with wall to floor marble. Evrything was perfect and very very comfortable. We were really pleasantly surprised and also found that the rate we got of 180 euros per night , incl breakfast was well worth it. Breakfasts were great, really well catered and very tasty with a mix of hot and cold choices. The service of the hotel staff, from reception to room cleaners was excellant. The area around the Vatican is okay, nothing too special but actually we felt it was a good place to stay. The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the metro and at 1 euro a journey it was a welcome change from the shafting you find on the underground in London. One tip, on the way to the metro you pass a little pizza rustica shop.....dont be tempted, they shafted us big time !!!!! However, we found Rome very reasonable in terms of food prices and even the cab fares were not extortionate. !!! Most people were very helpful and we felt secure at all times. Tips; We used http://www.romancandletours.com/ and did two tours, vatican and the ancient city tour. They were exceptional and I would highly rec them. Get a normal Rome cab back to the airport, they have a fixed price of 30 euros. Dont be worried about using the Metro, its really quite efficient and secure.

Now it's true that Hotel Alimandi's beds are comfortable; the rooms and bathrooms immaculately kept up; the prices exceptionally reasonable (I paid 90 Euros for a single at the peak of tourist season); the air conditioning pleasant and reliable; and the internet service convenient as there is a computer available downstairs. It's also true that the roof garden is a delightful oasis where you can start your day with hearty breakfasts (though I was too excited about Rome to actually have an appetite in the morning). And it's true that the hotel's location -- just across from the Vatican -- is lovely and close to the bus and metro lines. But that's not why I'll remember this hotel so fondly. The real magic of this place is supplied by the family that runs it. I came to Italy in substantial part to meet Italians, to glimpse a bit of their vaunted warmth and hospitality, and that's exactly what I got at the Alimandi the minute I walked into the hotel. From the warm smiles of Federica and Dunia ... to Salvio's thoughtful ruminations about Italian culture ... to Graziella's warmth, wisdom and wit ... to chef Francesco's ebullience and generosity -- this hotel is all heart. One warning however: if you ever happen to find yourself on the roof garden during a championship World Cup Soccer match with Italy poised to win, as I did: DON'T sit in front of Francesco. The man is a menace with a blowhorn ... nearly fell off my seat three times! No, seriously, I had the time of my life watching the game with staff and Italian friends and afterwards, the hotel broke out the Spumanti for everyone. It goes without saying that I hope to return to Rome again and again and that I'll never stay anywhere else but the Alimandi. A couple of tips: thanks to Federica's recommendation, I had several memorable meals at a charming family-run restaurant just a block away from the hotel: the Piacere Molise. (Molise is a small region in central Italy). Counterintuitive as it may sound to an American, try the fish-stuffed ravioli: it's fresh and homemade, as are all the dishes, and astonishingly good. Also, if you're interested in bringing back some beautiful etchings of Rome at very affordable prices, I wholeheartedly recommend Casali's at 81 Piazza della Rotonda just next to the Pantheon, just a short bus ride from the hotel. Be sure to say hi to owner Claudio Casali for me. One minor suggestion: I hope ALL the staff -- yes that means you too, Graziella and Salvio -- will post their photos here at tripadvisor.

The rooftop terrace is a delight, both to enjoy the outdoors as well as to visit with other guests, many of whom were Americans and reading Rick Steve's Italy or Rome guide as we were. The chef, Francesca, creates a lovely buffet each morning and serves up cappucino with gusto and a smile. If you return the smile and try out a little Italian, you may even get serenaded. My only gripe (but one for which I was prepared by reading previous TripAdviser posts) was that the breakfast buffet does not get sufficiently replenished, so that if you have the misfortune to be a guest while other large groups are in the hotel and they hit the buffet as early as 7:00 (although the posted start is 7:30), it may be cleaned out of many items by 8:00. So just be sure to be there early and you won't be disappointed.

Rome was the first stop on our 2005 trip to Europe between September and October. Other stays included the Residence La Tavolozza in Positano, the Hotel Bernardi-Semenzato in Venice, and the Mercure Tour Eiffel Suffern in Paris. Also see my reviews of these hotels. This year we stayed at the Alimandi for six nights. Last year, it was 4 nights. Truth be told, as far as I'm concerned, there is no reason to stay at any other hotel in Rome. It will always be our home away from home in Rome. The Alimandi is a family-run hotel with the emphasis on family. The Alimandis are a welcoming, friendly, and happy group of people. The Alimandis have two hotel buildings and our stay was at the original building at #8 via Tunisi. The other Alimandi is at #1, at the top of steps that lead to the Vatican Wall. The Alimandi brothers constantly walk back and forth between their two hotels. Our room was spotless. The sheets fresh and clean, the bathrooms scrubbed, and new towels were placed every day. The front desk staff is helpful and they speak very good English. At any time of the day, there is at least one of the owners present, be it Luigi, Paolo, or Enrico. They are the Alimandi brothers and they all live within seconds of the hotel - as in across the street in apartment buildings. The front desk is staffed with Alimandi relatives - be they nieces or nephews. An added bonus of staying here is the complimentary airport shuttle provided by the hotel. Rides are available until the early afternoon and the driver is - an Alimandi. The breakfast is included in the price of the room. It's served each morning from 7 until 10 in the rooftop garden (both open-air and covered seating). The breakfast is outstanding. Chef Francesco (yes, an Alimandi) serves up a variety of foods including chicken and potatoes, zucchini and mushrooms, and many other hearty dishes. He's constantly making fresh scrambled eggs. There are cereals, pastries, and sliced meats (salami, mortadella, and prosciutto, etc.). There is juice or milk or tea. There is world class coffee - even American-style. There is fruit (prunes, pears, peaches, pineapple). On a diet? There is yogurt. You can make your own toast. There are even power bars and other treats. And of course, there are wonderful pies baked by Chef Francesco himself. He is a hard-working man. Not only does he prepare the food - the rooftop garden seats around 75 or so people - but Francesco greets you and wants to make sure you enjoy your food. Another bonus, a great view of the Vatican and the tip of St. Peter's dome. After hours, you can visit the rooftop for quiet moments - perhaps some late-evening wine or a cigarette for those who smoke. No smoking inside the hotel itself, of course. I should also mention that the Alimandi has a workout room (including a stairmaster), an internet connection station off the workout room, a billiard room, a room with a bar and piano, and a television lounge. All are for the guests. There are also TVs in each room, although why anybody would want to watch television when all of Rome awaits is beyond me. The Hotel Alimandi is in the northside Prati district of Rome and except for the fact that you are down a few steps from the Vatican Wall and the Vatican Museum, it never feels as if you are surrounded by tourists. You actually seem to belong to a neighborhood. There are two Rome Metro Line A (subway) stops within 7 or 8 minutes walking distance from the hotel - the Cipro-Vatican Museum and the Ottaviano-St. Peter. Walk north a block from the hotel on Via Tunisi and turn left on Via Candia, which is a shopping street, to get to the Cipro stop. Turn right on Candia for the Ottaviano-St. Peter stop. There are stores and restaurants of every kind. Via Candia becomes Viale Giulio Cesare (Julius Ceasar Boulevard), which is where the Ottaviano stop is. Remember, in Rome street names change at the drop of a hat. You'll find even more restaurants and shops and a triplex movie theater. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory was one of the offerings there. Across the street from the movie theater on Julius Caesar is the Bella Napoli 2 restaurant. We ate there three of our six nights in Rome, and on a fourth night stopped in around midnight for sorbetto and wine. The Bella Napoli 2 has a great outdoor seating area - Romans generally eat between 8 and midnight - and the food is solid, basic Italian pizza and pasta. Nothing fancy, but good. Waitress Enza and waiter Ben (who speaks English) are as friendly as you'd want anybody to be. Nearby the Alimandi is a fantastic open-air food market on Via Andrea Doria at Tunisi. Simply walk a few blocks north on Tunisi. You can't missed it. There's prosciutto, porcini mushrooms, San Marzano tomatoes, fresh organic brown eggs, astonishing green produce, fresh baked bread, meats and poultry, and much more. It's a genuine treat to see how the Romans live and eat and shop. I also recommend the gelato and granita at the little gelateria across the street from the hotel's entrance. A few blocks down the street from where the hotel entrance fronts (Sebastiano Veniero at Tunisi) is a tiny repertory movie theater. It's on via Scipioni, which is an extension of Seb. Veniero. The theater is called Azzurro Scipioni Cinema and has two small auditoriums - one called Chaplin and the other called Lumiere. Classic Italian and international (American, European) films are shown. The non-Italian movies are usually in the original language. Remember that in Italy, most films are dubbed into Italian. At this cinema, the original language is usually king. Of course, when in Rome you'll visit the usual tourist attractions: St. Peter's, the Coloseum, the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, the Roman Forum, Mount Palantine museum, and the Capitoline Museum, etc. The Colosseum lit up at night is a special delight. May I recommend four things you might not consider? And believe me, you should consider them. Three of them are free. The first attraction you might not consider, but should, is a boat ride along the Tiber River. By bus, Metro, or by walking, get to the Tiber. It's about 15-20 minutes from the Alimandi. You'll see steps at most bridges (pontes) leading to the riverwalk. Rome has only just discovered its river views. The Tiber River boat cruise is relatively new. There are small buildings long the walk and inside is where you'll get information. English is spoken. The boats run frequently and journey quite a distance between Ponte Duca D'Aosta and Isola Tiberina (Tiberion Island). We caught our boat near Ponte (bridge) Sant' Angelo (near the old fort). The cost is 1 Euro for each direction. Therefore, if you want to experience the entire cruise, which is incredibly beautiful and pleasant, you'll pay 1 Euro at the start. You're at the halfway point. Then, depending on whether you heading north or south initially, you'll pay another Euro to return. Unless you board at the absolute north or south of the cruise, you really pay a total of 3 Euros for the full cruise. It's less confusing than it sounds and well-worth it. The northern stop is at the Olympic Statium and Olympic grounds with its giant statues in the park near the swimming center. Well-worth walking over to and then coming back to board the return boat. The conductor on the boat collects your money and gives you a ticket. The second attraction is the basilica, St. Paul's Outside The Walls (San Paolo Furi Le Mura). It's a stunning church, massive in size, and breathtaking in beauty. Until St. Peter's was built, this was the largest church in the world, erected over the burial site of St. Paul. The mosaics inside and outside are breathtaking. The columns are astonishing. The exterior and interior courtyards are superb. Take the Rome Metro B line (the blue line) to the Basilica S. Paolo stop. Then exit and walk four minutes to the church. It's open 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and it's free. The third attraction, and one of the most extraordinary, is a walk along the original Via Appia Antica - the Appian Way. Consider that ancient Romans road their chariots on the paving stones. And those paving stones are the real deal, still making up the narrow road remaining from ancient Rome. Along the early part of the Via Appia Antica - just for a few minutes - are huge estates. Right at the beginning is an Alimentari - a small grocery store - and you can get some snacks, bottled water, wine, meats, breads, etc. to have a picnic on the Appian Way. There are no tour guides. No giant buses. Just a narrow road and fields with flowers and gorgeous trees and ruins. We were astonished to see old tombs and remains of buildings. There were tons of pieces of marble statues, bits of old Rome here and there. It's quiet and peaceful and restive. Those few who come to visit can be spotted sitting relaxed on a marble slab or having a glass of wine and a sandwich. It's not crowded at all. The air is cooler, the sun brighter. You can get there by talking the Rome Metro A line (near the Alimandi) to the Colli Albani subway stop. Exit, and right in front of you will be buses. Take the number 660 bus. The ride to the tiny Appian Way turnaround is about 10 minutes. When you get off the bus, go left. You'll see a large brownish building which houses an apartment and the alimentari I mentioned. Again, get off the bus and go left (south). Stop into the alimentari, get some water or food, say hello to the owner (buon giorno) and enjoy the stroll. You can stroll as far as you want, maybe about an hour's time is best. Go to the first main highway that crosses the Appian Way. Then, if you want, simply turn around, walk back to the Alimentari and catch the 660 bus back to the Colli Albani subway stop and ride back to the Alimandi neighborhood. Another free attraction. The fourth fun attraction is the Porta Portese flea market, which runs on Sundays from early morning until around 3 p.m. It's an astonishing mix of old and new items. It's vast and there may have been 250,000 people there the Sunday we went. You've just got to keep walking and work your way into areas beyond the vendors set-up at the beginning. You can certainly take a cab to the market, which is located in the Trastevere neighborhood of Rome. You can also get there from the hotel by metro and bus. You can start by either walking along Julius Ceasar Boulevard to Via Lepanto. If you want to take the subway one stop from Ottaviano to Lepanto, you can. It's at Lepanto that you'll catch a bus heading south. It'll take you past St. Peter's and along the Tiber River to Trastevere. The bus will be crowded with flea market visitors. When they get off, you get off. Trust me, you'll know. Or ask questions. Most Romans speak a little English and they are very friendly. An experience that's also free, unless you buy things and there's a lot to buy. That's the Alimandi and my Roma.

I stayed at the 3-star Hotel Alimandi on Via Tunisi (behind the 4-star Hotel Alimandi across the street from the Vatican Museums) in September 2005. Do not confuse the two, which is easy. The Hotel Alimandi was recommended to me by several people I know. The (3-star) Hotel Alimandi, overall, is an excellent hotel and on my list of \"sure bets\" when I come to Rome with family from the States. The price, of course, is not the cheapest, but in my opinion one of the most reasonable prices you can pay when you consider several factors. First, it's about 50 meters from the front door of the Vatican Museums and a short walk to the rest of Vatican City. Can't beat the location. Secondly, the staff is excellent and friendly, and for those who don't speak Italian, are able to communicate in great English. The beds were clean, the rooms comfortable though a little sparse. Hey, it's not the Ritz! Lastly, and no less importantly, the breakfast was the largest I've ever seen in a hotel in Italy. No puny little pastry in a plastic bag, but a full complement of European and American buffet. Downsides to this hotel? Believe it or not, location. Being so close to the Vatican puts it at a distance from other landmarks, though still walkable. The Colosseum is perhaps the furthest \"must see\" if you're new to Rome, and is about a 20-30 minute walk, depending on how many turists are out and about. Those who give this hotel low marks must be very hard to please indeed. No place is perfect, though clearly some are very much better than others. This is one of those places.

Spotlessly clean, the staff was great and very helpful, breakfast was outstanding. I couldn't believe that we were right next door to the Vatican Museum. We loved the city of Rome, and would most diffently come back and stay at this hotel. In fact we had wished we had done Rome last instead of our first stop, as Rome was the highlight of our trip to Europe. We also loved the restaurant La Rustichella which was one of the restaurants the hotel recommended. Will stay at this hotel and will recommand it to anyone who is going to Rome.", "Date": "October 8, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oak Ridge, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cFantastic for Bargain for Rome\u201d", "Author": "ridger2222", "ReviewID": "UR2598890", "Content": "Everything positive in the other reviews is true.

We spent 3 wonderful nights at the Alimandi Hotel, a small, quaint, family-run hotel. Our room was quite comfortable with a/c, a great view & elevator! The staff was warm, very helpful with recommendations on where to eat, sights to see, bus line info, directions, and any other questions novice travelers could ask. They serve a huge buffet-style breakfast on the terrace overlooking St. Peters Basilica. The food was quite good, lots of choices with capuccinos and latte's galore. They are opening a second hotel in July or August, 2004 -- slightly larger. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and will definitely stay there again.

The beds were comfy and the room was clean. We stayed in a triple room.

We stayed in late May/early June for 3 nights before a cruise and 2 nights afterwards. We found this hotel and staff to be excellent. The rooms are moderate in size with dated furnishings but very clean, quiet and airy. They provided punctual bus service to and from the airport (free) as well as to the port of Civitavecchia (small fee). Friendly service was always available including a free full breakfast on a rooftop terrace. All the front desk persons were very helpful with suggestions, tickets and directions for both nearby subway and bus service for which we took full advantage.
