As designers we totally appreciated the supreme level of design and quality. The staff was super friendly and accommodating and super nice to give us penthouse rooms with huge decks and excellent views during both our one night stays, a week apart. Nice fitness center, too. And, a welcome back fruit plate waiting in our room when we checked back in with a note of appreciation for our business. Thank you, Hotel Indigo! (Plenty of shops and restaurants nearby, short walk to S train, U and bus to airport. Market 3 minute walk, design center two blocks away.)", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel and location, small rooms\u201d", "Author": "Englishlee", "ReviewID": "UR127612605", "Content": "Stayed 2 nights at the brand new (opened 2 months) Hotel Indigo. Initial impressions were great, clean contemporary looking lobby, excellent friendly front desk staff, and we even got given a glass of bubbly to enjoy whilst we checked in. The rooms were also very contemporary (which we like) and as we'd been upgraded to an executive room we had a balcony overlooking part of the city. The rooms were however small, if I were staying any longer than a long weekend I think it would have been a struggle to cope with two people plus clothes etc. We did have one problem. When we got to our room there was a faint unpleasant smell, a bit like a drain. We put it down to the fact that they might have been working on the plumbing and went out to dinner. Overnight the smell got worse and the next day we asked to change rooms - which was no problem and was handled very graciously by the excellent front desk staff. This room was better but again overnight the smell started getting worse. Not sure what the problem is / was. Many of the drains around Berlin did whiff, so maybe the ventilation ducts on the roof was sucking in something like that. We also had breakfast at the hotel (included in the rate) which was very good and consisted of cold cheeses and meats, cereals, fruit, breads and if you wanted fried eggs, omelettes. Would I stay here again? Yes if the rates was good, as the location is great at just a 5 minute walk from the Zoo station and a similar distance from many restaurants etc and the hotel staff were also very good. But the management needs to figure out what the issue re the smell is.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "natisherre", "ReviewID": "UR127457028", "Content": "New hotel-boutique, great design and good location in West Berlin.

In under 2 minutes walking you are at a train station with S-bahn, U-bahn, Tegel bus, bus and metro bus services to all over Berlin. The Airport Express train that takes to SXF and soon to the new Berlin airport also has a stop at this station. The location is also within a very close proximity to the famous Ku'damm and the Kaiser-Wilhelm Memorial Church (5 minutes on foot) with famous stores such as KaDaWe within 10 minutes walking. A supermarket is 2 minutes away which can cater to all your needs. In my opinion, the location is superb. The staff are very nice and helpful, small lobby, cozy feeling to the hotel. Two elevators that serve the small hotel which are more than enough. Never had a problem getting an elevator to go up or down. The rooms are nice, modern, well furnished, excellent bed, a bit smaller than normal but still decent in size I would say. The internet was fast, bathroom was nice and the shower was just great. The hotel in its entirety is very clean and found it to be spotless. I would highly recommend this hotel without reservations.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tel Aviv, Israel", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel\u201d", "Author": "Austrian_Airlines", "ReviewID": "UR126792478", "Content": "I stayed at the hotel Indigo in berlin for 5 days in march. The hotel is brand new, great design and well located (for people who love to stay in west berlin). Staff are very nice, and provide good service. The rooms itself is well equipped - iPhone docking station, Coffee machine and well equipped bathroom. The bed is very comfortable. Wireless internet is included in the room rate, it's slow (you will not manage to watch a youtube video), but it's great for browsing the internet and emails. They have a small gym - which is not that bad for a small hotel. There are few drawbacks though, Some rooms are very small. I have changed the room to a larger one. The rooms on the 6th floor have balconies and are larger. The first room i have had does not have enough space for a couple with two suitcases.

I am so tired of staying in the same hotels everywhere I go - it is so refreshing to find a new exciting, fresh hotel concept where at the same time I can earn my points. I found the interior of the hotel very inspiring and original - the staff was great and super friendly and knowledgable. I noted that some people have written that the rooms are small, but I did not get that impression - I loved my room and bed. I managed to get a lot of work done and getting free phone calls and internet was an extra plus and something that comes in handy. The breakfast was great and in particular I loved the fresh apple juice. I have stayed in lots of hotels in Berlin and throughout Germany. This has already become one of my favourite hotels.
