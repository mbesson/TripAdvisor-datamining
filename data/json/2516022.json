I`ve stayed there twice, last time in March for two weeks and I will always choose Mr. C when I travel to LA. Rooms are perfectly clean, classy and comfortable with service twice a day. All rooms have a balcony. Concierges, front desk, bellman, housekeeping, actually everyone there is always greeting you with a friendly smile and always at your service. The concierges Solomon and Choi are always helpful, they give you OUTSTANDING service and are the friendliest concierges I\u2019ve ever encountered on my many travels. Solomon really stands out. When I left it felt like leaving an amazing friend who only wants the best for you. He made Mr C feel like my home away from home. Mr. C is located in a beautiful residential neighborhood with perfect access to Beverly Hills and West Hollywood. Walking distance to Rodeo Drive and the house car takes guests within a 3 mile radius from the hotel. The house car driver Angel made sure every ride was comfortable and he was always friendly too. The restaurant is really worth a visit also. Italian style with white linen furnished tables and tasty Italian food. According to Haute Living Mr. C brings class to Italian dining and listed MR C among the Top 5 Italian Eats in LA. They should have been number one. Looks like the restaurant and bar/lobby is also very popular among the \u201clocals\u201d and have lots of returning guests.

Flew in from Vegas where we stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, also a 5 star hotel. Apart from the obvious design/decor differences these two hotels couldn't be more different in terms of being a \"5 star hotel\" First impressions were good, the Valet guys are friendly and efficient. Escorted to the lobby of the hotel where the check in happened at the bar. 2 complimentary bellini's. Presented in 2 short (almost shot-size) glasses. I would have prefered champagne glasses. Prior to arriving at the hotel I was in touch with their concierge as I had some concerns from other reviewers about noise etc. They were helpful and advised we booked a premier view room (the most expensive) that faced the front of the hotel as they were deemed to be quieter. The rooms facing the other side of the hotel looks out over a very busy main road. (the actual size of the rooms are exactly the same though) the premium you pay is for rest and peace. Fine. Our room was on the 11th floor- again, requested by me to avoid noise issues. We had a corner room so had a lovely view of Beverly Hills. The Hollywood sign is a lot further than I thought- had to really squint to see it. I loved the decor of the room, Frank Sinatra/Old hollywood and the actual size of the room was perfect. No bath but it didn't bother us as I never bother with a bath on holiday. In terms of the cleanliness of the room, sad to report that it didn't live up to 5 star standards.. I found a couple of hairs IN the bed. (yes, i'm OCD and inspect a bed before getting into it) and general \"bits\" on the floor. Pictures indicate a sofa in the bedrooms- we had a chair. Not a big deal but would have prefered a sofa as we ordered room service one night and it would have made eating it at the table a lot easier. Since I'm on the topic- room service: No nice way of saying this- it was crap. HORRIBLE. To be fair, from other reviewers, i didn't expect anything amazing but this was truly awful. I had the Tagliardi with Veal Rag\u03cd - a lump of pasta with un-seasoned, bland sauce. Could have been anything. Husband had the grilled chicken which was dry and didn't come with anything! I guess you could argue that the golden rule is to always have a burger/club sandwich when ordering room service but since they rave about the restaurant..erm, really? We used the house car a couple of times- lovely driver. Valet was generally very quick with our car and possibly the highlight of our stay. (We did tip very generously which might have helped) Went down to the bar for a drink on the second day, sat for absolutely ages with no barman in sight. After about 10 minutes of waiting I stopped a member of staff walking by and asked if there was a danger of us getting served.. he turned out to be a manager of some sort.. grumbled about the bar man being \"missing\".. lots of faffing about before finally coming 'round to the bar and pouring our drinks himself. Moaned to us that the bar man must be on a \"break\" somewhere. 5 star service you say... They did give us the drinks free in the end, but really?? We have to chase someone to get us a drink? whilst sitting AT THE BAR?? We were getting ready to go out on our second night when the sound of thumping latin music filled the air. Our neighbours decided to throw a party.. We had a connecting door in our room to the room next door so they might has well have been IN our room the noise was so loud! We could hear every single word they shouted over the music. Great. So much for paying a PREMIUM to be away from the noise. Absolutely no sound proofing whatsoever. We spoke to reception about our concerns and they offered to move us to a different room once we get back from dinner (midnight?) or housekeeping could move our stuff whilst we were out. Not sure how they thought that could work? I had 20days worth of clothes/shoes/bags all over the room. (yes, i travel like a diva..) point being, we would then had to sort everything out upon our return as we had a early flight in the morning so we declined. My husband suggested we go to dinner and hopefully things would have calmed down upon our return. Thankfully, this was the case. Not sure if the hotel had a hand in this but if they did- good on them. However this shouldn't be a issue in the first place!! There was no noise issue at all at the Mandarin Oriental, despite being in VEGAS and our suite being next to the lift. 5 star done right! Lastly, upon checking out I advised the receptionist that I wanted to pay the balance of our stay on my bank cash card. (they swiped my credit card upon check-in for \"incidentals\").. a day later, after landing in San Fran, i discovered the hotel took over \u00a3500 (about $700) from my cash card!!!! We called them up and they said this was standard procedure to cover incidentals? wtf? We CHECKED OUT! we have LEFT the hotel? You already charged my credit card for this when we checked in?? Why charge our card???? This conversation went on and on for about 20min with no reasonable explanation. We demanded the money returned to our card. It got returned- 4 weeks later. This money was put onto my cash card as spending money! Meant we had \u00a3500 less to spend on our holiday. Unacceptable. I'll end the review on a positive- we left some important documents at the hotel and they send it to us by fedex the next day. (we were charged a premium) I rely heavily on tripadvisor for my bookings so I hope after reading this you will be able to make a informed decision. I have tried to contact the hotel with my concerns but they have not replied.

The decor is modern and classic, it is comfortable without being stuffy, and its immaculately clean. The entire staff will bend over backwards for you. The rooms are just right for being comfortable and cozy, you enter to a dressing area with closets and a dressing table which has the bathroom off to the right side and the bedroom directly in front. Each room has a private balcony with beautiful views from the higher floors (especially if you are facing the hills away from Pico). Upon entering the hotel you are greeted to a free bellini while the concierge shuffles your bags to your room. The bar is open and conversational, with additional indoor and outdoor seating areas to the side. The drink prices are high, but this is a 5-Star hotel in LA, so they are actually standard. The only con I can think of is that its a bit of a walk from the hip spots in LA, but there is a free shuttle service (in an Escalade) which we used frequently. And once you get your bearings, you can walk to several areas in about 10-15 minutes (including Rodeo Dr.). I never ate at the restaurant, but the entire hotel is simply fabulous.

My 8-yr-old daughter and I arrived at 10am on March 10, and because of the excellent service we received the last time we were there, I knew there would be no problem with arriving at the hotel early and asking them to store our bags till check-in. I was correct. Upon arrival, we were greeted at our cab by wonderful members of the valet staff...the most fabulous I have ever encountered. They took our bags to storage while we enjoyed Bellinis (a virgin Bellini for my daughter!) at the lobby bar (where the bartender was very personable) and got checked in. So far, so good! Both times we have stayed at the hotel, I have been absolutely amazed by the service of the valet/bell staff. They remember guests' names, and by the end of the stay, they felt like friends. Because we are from North Carolina, we were partial to Brandon, who quickly introduced himself to us as another North Carolinian...making everything seem more familiar. We were waiting for friends to arrive later in the day, but I wanted to get some shopping done on Robertson before their arrival, so I asked if the house car would be able to take us there. Not only did Art, the very warm and friendly driver, take us to Robertson; he told us to call him when we were ready to return. We shopped our favorite places on Robertson and had a late lunch at Newsroom Cafe before calling Art , who promptly picked us up and didn't seem to mind at all when we asked him to make a quick stop at Sprinkles Cupcakes on Santa Monica Blvd before returning to the hotel. Not only did he take us, but he circled the block while we got our cupcakes! Now, THAT'S service! Let me now tell you some important info about location. This hotel is located at the intersection of Beverwil and Pico, which places it JUST outside the Beverly Hills city limits, but it is the perfect location for anyone who wants to explore the city. Walking to the shopping/restaurants of Beverly Hills is several blocks, but easy for anyone in relatively good health, and it's a beautiful stroll! For those who cannot do it, the hotel car is available most of the time to take you anywhere within a three mile radius of the hotel. If you need to go a greater distance, the valet/bell staff is always happy to help you with a cab. We found them to be very prompt. Also, if you need to rent a car for a day or two, I'm sure the hotel can help you. We wanted to take the kids to Disneyland one day, so we just called the Enterprise location on La Cienega, and they were able to pick us up before our rental and drop us back at the hotel afterward. I would like to add that we used the hotel car a lot during our stay, and both Art and Angel, the drivers, were most courteous and friendly. We truly felt like we had made new friends with them before we left the hotel! As for the rooms at the hotel, they are quite comfortable. Every room has a balcony or even two, and we found the beds and pillows to be quite comfortable. We had no problems with noise from other guests, and we were thrilled to find a newspaper at our door every morning. The room we stayed in had only a shower and no tub, but that was not an issue for us. I'm not the person who takes a bath in a hotel, anyway. The soaps/shampoos the hotel provided were good and plentiful, and the towels were good too. The hairdryer in the room is better quality than the one I have at home, and there is an iron/ironing board if you need it. The bar in the room is fully stocked, as well. No complaints at all. I also must commend the housekeeping staff, who did an excellent job of keeping our room clean and neat while we were there. With two 8-yr-olds in the room, it wasn't always easy to keep it straight, but every evening when we returned, we found everything had been returned to order! Because we were on the go during this trip, we were unable to enjoy a meal in the hotel's restaurant. We did order room service one morning, and it was prompt and delicious. If you are a coffee drinker, you will not be disappointed. Just as when we left the hotel last July, we were sorry to leave. Almost everything about our stay was perfect, and we could not have been more pleased. Thank you, Mr. C staff, for another wonderful stay. We look forward to returning and would like to commend the following people on their excellent service: Brandon (valet/bell staff), Emily (lobby bar), Ben (bartender), Joshua Garman (a friendly member of the staff) and especially Art and Angel, who helped us navigate the city!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing and Fun!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer L Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126283943", "Content": "Perfect hotel to lounge and relax in after a long wedding day!

The hotel is amazing in every way. It's like a bit of Europe in LA. These people DO know how to treat guests and run a beautiful and trendy hotel. The front desk is smart, helpful and professional, but at the same time, friendly. You are greeted in the valet area at your car and whisked away to the long, sleek marble bar in the lobby for a seat and a complimentary Bellini (this is a Cipriani hotel after all). While you sip, someone takes your credit card and checks you in. He then comes back to you (still sipping) with your room key. So relaxing and simple. The rooms are stunning. I was given a high-floor King with every amenity I could possibly need with a view that I am still talking about. On my small but big enough balcony I could see miles and miles into Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Brentwood, Century City, and even to the Hollywood sign and Griffith Park and Observatory. Wow. The beds are fabulous. The sheets are crisp and luxurious. The decor was uncluttered and sleek - leather everywhere. Mirrors on every wall. No tubs, but huge showers with rain and hand-held heads. There was even a make-up vanity with a leather seat and mirror. Room Service was quick and they never got the order wrong (that's a first for most hotels) - in fact, twice they sent us (my college-aged kids were next door) extra nibbles. Nice. The lobby bar is handled by Emily, a true Southern Belle, who cannot do enough for anyone. The valets are a group of guys who greet you every single time they see you with a smile and a \"Welcome back to Mr. C. How was your afternoon?\" So polite. The concierge desk is manned by Kimberly, a beautiful and trendy British gal who knows just where everything is and is happening. She won't let you eat anywhere that isn't fabulous - she's got your back. The other concierge that I used was Solomon, a warm and smart gentleman who truly cares for his guests and treats them as if they were family in his home. When I had a problem with a restaurant, he told me that he wasn't going to send guests there anymore. He made me feel better about this restaurant and the shabby way that they treated my daughter, son and I. He then made sure that we enjoyed dessert in the lobby on him. Not necessary, but so thoughtful. There is a fitness center with many machines available 24/7. The magnificent rooftop is used only for private events, but any hotel guest can go up there to look around and enjoy the 360 degree breathtaking view. We only ate the restaurant food by the lovely, but small pool but it was excellent. Even the poolboys cannot do enough for you. When my daughter and son decided to move their chaises so to be in more direct sunlight, the poolboy insisted that they allow him to arrange the proper angle, new towels with headrests and a table between. Even my kids were impressed. The restaurant itself is beautiful. With a car, the location is great. Midway to everything. I would stay at this hotel again and again. No other hotel in LA could come close to the care, beauty, and professionalism of Mr. C.

The room was exactly as it is on their website photos. Lovely room which was spacious and very clean, nice leather sofas etc. This hotel gives a personal touch service to its guests, for example the manager himself welcomed us and showed us up to our room and drinks offered on arrival. The Concierge staff gave us an excellent service, booked our restaurants, taxis, and universal studio tour etc. The bed is turned down for you and the newspaper is always delivered in a little cotton bag hung on the door. Very polite courteous staff. On the down side there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room. Food and drink are typical five star prices, we had breakfast in the restaurant for two people which cost just over $50 - I think it was $7 for a cup of coffee (small). In the morning the hotel do put out some complimentary coffee which you could go down and get to bring back to your room but we only found out about this on the last day. In terms of location this hotel is in a residential area and NOT near any tourist type of places if that is what you want to do - i.e. hollywood/sunset boulevard/universal studios/Downtown LA etc. Rodeo Drive is about 15/20 minute walk but the hotel really is located in a residential area - so be warned as taxi fares can start adding up - there is a house car which takes you within 3 miles of the hotel but this is not always available. We ate at STK in West Hollywood - food lovely, typical five star prices. We also had dinner at the Beverly Wilshire hotel and got a window seat looking onto Rodeo Drive. I was extremely disappointed with the food - I think they just re-heated the mash potato the food was very, very average and not of a high standard. We went to downtown LA and ate at the nickel diner - I had an avocado dish, it was delicious and soooooooo cheap. We didn't feel very safe in downtown LA probably because we have never been before and ventured down some dodgy blocks, needless to say we swiftly turned back.

Although our January visit had fewer oddities, the service and ambiance were not quite as European. Instead of immediately offering the on-arrival complimentary bellini, the greeter offered us tea or coffee; only when we looked baffled did he offer the bellini. Mr C is a European style hotel, with the pros and cons associated with this. Cons: very high prices for such things as drinks and coffee; showers but no tubs; no icemakers--it is necessary to call room service; no in-room coffee makers.Pros: the aforementioned ambiance and service; newspapers delivered on the door handle in little cloth bags. The rooms at Mr C are spacious and lovely, furnished in either white or brown leather (I prefer the white). On our first stay I asked for a quiet room far from the elevator, and I got a noisy room right near the elevator with several other sources of noise--the outside entrance below, the moving of furniture above, and the people next door. This time I got a room that, although still next to the elevator, was quiet. Again, except for the people above--we could hear them pee, flush, and walk around. The stylish wood floors in the rooms are not insulated enough against upstairs noise. We ate at the restaurant both times. The first time we were very impressed with both the food and the drink, although they tried (as always seems to happen to me) to seat us right next to the service station. This time they succeeded in seating us right next to the service station; when I complained about the rattling of cutlery and asked to move, the waiter (who was very pleasant) assured us the noise would stop. It didn't, nor did the constant movement of people back and forth around and behind us. There was no need to seat us in this spot, the restaurant was about one third full. We had several dishes ranging from exellent (the proscuttio cotta with mozarella) to Chef Boy-Ar-Dee (the pasta with red sauce and sausage; I would stay away from anything with red sauce in Mr. C). The white cake and sorbets were awesome. The glasses of wine were ridiculously small, and thus incredibly overpriced. Also overpriced: the parking, at $35 a day. If I could only rid myself of my travel jinxes, which follow me absolutely everywhere I go: being seated at the table next to the service station, and being assigned a room next to the elevator and ice maker (that is, in hotels that have an icemaker). Although Mr. C says it is in Beverly Hills, it is not, it is adjacent. There is a handy Ralph's across the road, but not much else.

I selected Mr. C's at the recommendation of a friend, who is a regular n the Beverly Hills area. After looking a the past reviews and the hotel's website I decided to book a premium Beverly Hills view room on a high floor. Before arriving, I received an email from the hotel's concierge, offering assistance with airport transportation and other arrival details. I have to say that the concierges at Mr. C's are among the best I've ever interacted with. Not only are they very corteous and professional, but they are well connected, experienced and effective. They fond the perfect solutions every time, from renting a Fiat 500 to getting me on the guest list of a popular night spot. A big recognition to Solomon in the concierge desk! The valets and doormen are equally effective and very elegantly appointed in non-ostentatious but classic Barbour jackets. The hotel lobby takes you straight into the main bar, where I was treated to fantastic bellinis. So good that I went up to my room after 45 minutes of arriving! The bar and lobby scene is relaxed, refined and dressed up in an Italian/bauhaus design mix, with the friendliest bar servers that you can imagine. There is an outdoors terrace on the bar, which is perfect for an ever more intimate experience. The hotel's reception is cleverly hidden behind the bar, so that at no moment do yo feel in a hotel. I always felt as if arriving to a friend's apartment. Very cozy and welcoming! I used the hotel's gym several times and it is very well equipped with cardio and weights although it is on the smaller side and I could see it crowding up on peak seasons. The hotel's pool is next to the restaurant! which makes the entrance a bit intimidatng at lunch time, however, it is ver cutely arranged and I would really like to come back in the summer heat to dip in and enjoy more bellinis there. My room had a striking view to Beverly Hills and Hollywood. I slept with the drapes open as it was impossible not to fall in love with the sight. Very quiet day and night, although I can imagine that rooms facing the city side on West Pico Ave. must be noisier. The rooms are all very elegantly decorated in a matching blend of French riviera, sea-side villa and Italian country side. You experience wood, leather, pastels and rich fabrics. Very complete mini-bar (including intimacy and healing kits!), iPod compatible stereo, flat screen on-demand TV with movies and very fast and free wi-fi everywhere. My room had a small terrace that I used for breakfast and after work drinks. Fantastic!! I could live here!! The restaurant was the best part of my stay. Although not as popular as I would have expected for a Cipriani property, the service, quality and value are truly remarkable. I felt as if dining in a high end place in Rome. Truly, something else! from the proseco to the slow roasted chicken, I very much enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner at Mr. C. All in all, Mr. C's is an excellent representation of a luxury boutique hotel. It is discreet, elegant and powerful. Just what I like!

We typically travel every month and usually stay in hotels like the Four Seasons and luxury boutique hotels. The opening of Mr. C Beverly Hills intrigued us and we therefore booked ourselves a weekend away. Check-in was quick and easy (with a complimentary \u2018Bellini\u2019 in the bar) however, it took quite some time for the bell boy to bring up the luggage even though the hotel appeared to be not very busy. Several other guests spoke of a similar experience over the weekend. The rooms are decorated very nicely and come with complimentary Wi-Fi and bottled water. Our only concern was the noise level. We requested and were given one of the quieter rooms (facing the hills) which was quiet with respect to street noise. Design details of the hotel however resulted in the room being quite noisy. Rooms are fitted with hard wood floors that echo footsteps from above. It seemed to never end. We heard kids jumping and running around and the clicking of shoes throughout our stay. Voices, TV noise, and music reverberated through the walls. In addition, guest room doors are large and the sound of slamming doors can be heard up and down the hallways day and night. We ended up stuffing towels under our door (as the gap is quite large) but this did not insulate us from the almost constant noise. On the second night of our stay there was an engagement party in the 12th floor banquet room that had a DJ playing music until 3am. The music could be heard all the way down to our 9th floor room. Management were quick to apologize and ended up not charging us for one night and agreed to move us to a quieter room. The second room ended up being no quieter. By far the best part of our stay was the restaurant. Staff were friendly and attentive. Although we were usually the only couple having breakfast, the place was jammed at dinner. The food and service was fantastic but again the noise level was uncomfortably loud; more like a sports bar. Clearly the place is full of locals at night and on the weekend as everyone seemed to know each other. In the end it was a good stay, however next time we\u2019ll be back at the Four Seasons or L\u2019Ermitage. By the way, Mr. Jagger (the manager) and Mr. Cipriani (the owner) were in town and were around all weekend. Mr. Cipriani held court in the restaurant each evening.

I usually stay at the Peninsula when I'm in LA and their service is certainly excellent as well, but it's different at Mr. C.

The public spaces and the rooms are quite small but are beautifully appointed and met all of my needs.

I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there whenever I have the opportunity to visit LA again.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport Beach, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience in a BH hotel!\u201d", "Author": "kewlflower", "ReviewID": "UR115100221", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at Mr. C BH for our wedding anniversary. Too bad we could only stay one night because this was such a great deal for their July 4th promo. The entire experience was awesome from the minute we pulled into the parking lot to check out. The hotel is new so it was quiet (which we loved). We had a standard room on the 8th floor with a stunning view of the city. Room was huge (unlike boutique hotels) with two closets! love the decor and the clean look and feel of a new hotel. The sheets and bedding were perfect. We also received a complimentary bottle of Proseco and chocolates upon arrival. Not sure if that was standard or because we were celebrating our anniversary. Rodeo shopping is only a few minutes away so we just walked everywhere. We are definitely going back. Hopefully they retain their high level of service.", "Date": "July 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cA new hotel still has things to work on..\u201d", "Author": "OYKU", "ReviewID": "UR115049685", "Content": "We are a young married couple who stayed at this hotel in mid june 2011 It is a chic hotel maybe better for business or age +40 Rooms are very good, well decorated smells new but sleeping quality in the rooms are bad because light in the balcony never goes off!!

Another thing; they lost a box came for me more than 5 days!! so I had to think of it, call them twice a day to ask if they found it.. Employees don't know each other even the managers can't find out a person by his surname!! a box comes, somebody takes and signs for it.. than it gets lost.. they found it just 2 days before I leave the country..

The hotel had only re-opened (after major renovations and refurbishment) on 1st June 2011. The staff and service are second to none and definitely rivals any world class hotel I have I stay in around the world. The atmosphere, from the moment you pull up at the front, is welcoming and friendly. Nothing is too hard or too much for the staff and it is obvious they love their job and the hotel. I stayed on the 5th floor in a Deluxe City View room. I was fortunate to get a corner room with 2 balconies, one overlooking the gorgeous pool area, the other over-looking the city. The rooms are large and comfortable, with great amenities and layout. I don't think the room rates are high for this calibre of hotel. In fact, I would say the rates are quite low, compared to other 5 star hotels in the area and for what you get for your money. However, if you dine in the restaurant downstairs or order room service, or anything from bar or pool area, you will pay ridiculously high prices. A vodka/tonic by the pool cost me $24.95 but this was credited back to me when I complained about the price. There is no price list, so ask before you order. The restaurant menu and room service menu does have prices, but don't forget ... you have to tip also. There is a $4 surcharge for all room service orders, so bear that in mind, on top of what you order from the menu. Although the restaurant prices are high, after having breakfast and dinner in there a few times, the prices are on par with the quality of food, service and ambience. You will pay the same prices in any other restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I was blown away by this place. Everything about it oozes quality and luxury. I have read reviews that say the hotel and staff are obnoxious and pretentious. I would strongly disagree! If you want staff who are going to treat you like a backpacker, then go to a backpacker establishment. This is a world class hotel. The staff are trained to be friendly, courteous and obliging. I would say that some of the \"A list\" celebrity and affluent guests who stay and dine at the hotel are a little pretentious, but certainly not off-putting. This is what money buys ... luxury, fine wining and dining and an establishment that will spoil you. The only thing I had an issue with is the placement of the power points in the room. They are all tucked away behind items of large furniture. However, even this was quickly addressed with one of the staff members coming up to my room and plugging in a powerboard for me. This place is going to be near impossible to beat, for me anyway. Having stayed in more hotels than I can count, around most of the world, this will be THE hotel I stay in every time, whenever I am in Los Angeles. Whether you are on business or holiday or simply want to spoil someone for a night or 2, this place will not leave you disappointed. You will not want to leave.

When entering, the hotel lobby appears a mix of old-school NYC Yale/Yacht/21 club lounge [tho modernized a bit] + high-end-home dining room / library-esque - which in LA, seems off. Its almost too open/airy in terms of spacing to feel intimate enough to share a drink as a couple or small group. The decor is high end and 'nice' but over-thought, and while you want to imagine a vibrant bunch of beautiful, well-dressed people standing around sipping belinis - in reality it would be entirely awkward for such a scene to take place in a location like this because of the lay-out and decor. As an aside, the bartenders stand on a lower level behind an expansive bar when entering, which is also just the wrong amount of edgy - the sofas in the lobby too deep to comfortably sit. Hotel staff & loiterers alike were nearly all dressed just a little too-nice for a mid June vacation/afternoon - groups of men in 3 piece suits on the pool deck & women in little black dresses around brunch time on sunday. High end cars frequented the premier 'show-off' parking spots at various times of the day - a white bentley affixed on the grass by the entry fountain, several black maseratis strewn about other locations midday seemed more like props - even in \"kind-of Beverly Hills\"- than actual guests' vehicles. The hallways are carpeted w/ a plush velour maroon or blue (depending on your floor) w/ walls that accent said colors (pink/baby blue) - which is kind of just like \"huh?\" The rooms are decent, not that large or small - the views from floors 2-9 on both sides leave a lot to be desired - especially \"downtown facing\" given you largely overlook a large shopping complex w/ glowing lights from the ever popular Ross's grocer - the pool deck has no views as it is surrounded entirely by concrete walls and a few oddly placed, very tall palm trees. The pool is incredibly small & most of the comfortable sofa-chairs are situated underneath said tall concrete walls blocking the sun - leaving guests to choose from oddly shaped lounger chairs or those which are non-cushioned. If you're looking for a nice, spacious cabana - this also is not the pool for you. We much rather preferred the views, pool deck, seating & overall 'scene' at the Mondrian LA, for instance. The location isn't great - cabs anywhere are a must - or you find yourself wandering through residential stretches or questionable strip mall lined streets - the complementary car service is sort of a farce - 1 car, fist come first serve. Mini gripes mostly associated w/ new hotel growing pains - our room wasn't ready at 3pm check-in, wireless internet runs the speed of dial-up, no #'s on the telephones, simple computer paper printed menu, no mini-bar price list, & no specified hotel concierge are all side complaints. My friend and I are in our late twenty's and feel this hotel caters more to the 35-40+ married couple, retiree, or business trip clientele. And even at that, hopefully you dress well, have frothy high end taste, and don't mind wondering every now and again if perhaps you're at the wrong place and instead stopped by a scene out of Mad Men - this would be the hotel for you. It's not for lack of trying - rather trying too hard.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201ca day in heaven\u201d", "Author": "ericgh3", "ReviewID": "UR112821500", "Content": "First of all the pool was extraordinary and relaxing.
