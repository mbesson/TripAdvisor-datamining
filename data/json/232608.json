Also the 8 euro, they charge for the breakfast is soooo totally worth it. The meats are delicious and it is enough to fill you up until 4 or 5 in the evening, and both me and my wife did just that. Now, the only complain we had was the location, the website suggested it was 15 mins away from the city centre. However this is the reality - it will take you about 7 mins or so to walk to the nearest train station (S Bahn) and one train will take you to Alexanderplatz in 15 mins. From Alexanderplatz you have the options for connections via U Bahn and other modes of transtport. So in reality it will take about 30 to 40 mins for you to get to the centre. But overall this hotel was clean and nice, it is more of a hostel with an option of a pvt bathroom. Good for budget travellers who need a hotel with no frills and basically a place to shower and crash for the night.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "envbecky", "Title": "\u201cLike a delinquant youth centre, but with worse beds!!!!\u201d", "Author": "envbecky", "ReviewID": "UR59758183", "Content": "I have just got back from a stay at this hotel - I am doing an MA course at university and I was there on a field trip tos study Berlin. (in a large group of full time and part time students - many of us however study part time and have full time jobs. The hotel is located a very long way away from the centre of Berlin, and took over 30 mins when on the tram to get to Alexandereplatz. There were three of us sharing a room for 3 night, but alas there were only two actual beds and 1 small fold out sofa bed with a mattress that was the thinnest I have ever seen on a sofa bed. The shower althogh good is in the tinyest cubicle with no space to wash properly. The rooms mini bar consisted of a bottle of sparling water (no fridge) left on the shelf which cost 2.80 euros. This aside the worst thing about this hotel was the other guests. When we arrived there was a group of roudy italian girls swearing and smoking and generally being noisy. The hotel seemed to be oblivious to the noise and showed no signs of asking them to calm down. I guess they were 16-18 years old but several of them were served at the bar. They shoved us around in the lift and were just out of control. But they didn't annoy me as much as the shool kids doing a field trip for economics as they were chanting, drunk as farts until 4am every morning. Again they didn't seem old enough to be served in the bar but were getting drunk every night and I saw them purchasing beer without any checks. One of them spoke to me (I think he was trying to chat me up until I pointed out that I was 30 which is why I know it was a school field trip). The bar ran dry for us every night, and we were about the last people to be served by the bar staff who were particually cold to us, I am guessing this was because we were actually old enough to buy beer. There was a group of junoir school kids that were running riot banging on doors all evening and messing about with the lifts all night and squealing. Breakfast was very average, the bar too small - and full of drunk children. All in I am sure its calmer in a young offenders institute which is what this hotel felt like and I really wouldn't recommend staying here unless your 15 years old and want to get drunk with no questions asked. My only hope is that my University got the hotel rooms really cheaply - as stated there were only two actual tiny single beds in our room. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone at all apart from school kids - who will be fine to just go wild ! Anyone else - I recommend you avoid it like the plague and head somewhere else. If I wasn't on a uni feild trip I would have checked out on the first night and paid whatever it took to stay anywhere else.

It had a small hallway leading into the bedroom where there was enough space to store our suitcases. The bedroom was very large and had huge windows looking out to the street. It was also very clean. The bathroom was big, although the shower was tiny. The buffet breakfast was nice and plentiful with fruits, cereals and rolls. The only downside to staying at this hotel was that it was booked out with school groups when we stayed there, although they weren't very noisy and didn't bother other guests.
