Later on having a drink, taking in the spectacular view, the manager approached and also wished my mother a happy day. She was thrilled. Sometimes in busy hotels the personal approach is overlooked but not here. All the staff were friendly, approachable and professional. This is a hotel in a very old wharf in an excellent location. The rooms have apparently been upgraded and were beautiful. Decor minimalistic and clean, comfy beds, quite air con............. don't you just love fresh white linen. Waking to a view of Sydney Harbour is unbeatable as a start to the day and is topped off with a great breakfast, once again with speedy service.

You MUST pay the extra for a waterside room otherwise you will be looking at the street and rocks behind the hotel. The views of the harbour are towards Walsh Bay so you dont get the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge view but even so its still beautiful. The hotel does have valet parking but it is outside and not undercover. Or you can park on the street but I wouldnt as the parking police can be vicious even on weekends. On one stay we got a family room with a double bed and sofa bed and it had the biggest balcony you could ever dream of with a huge table and chairs. Its the only room with a balcony and we felt so special. I have attempted to get this room each other time but alas never been as lucky. The waterside rooms on the top floor are a bit hard to see the water as it is under the timber work of the eaves, so i would suggest requesting middle or bottom levels. The bottom level opens out onto the wharf. We ate in the restaurant. We arrived late and were going to go to Rockpool but in the end got into Sydney too late. I wished we had've as the restaurant whilst it was OK I wouldnt rave about it. Rockpool would've been nicer but it was a long weekend. The breakfast though was fine and its such a fantastic place to start your day from. It is so relaxing sitting out on the wharf. They even made a decent latte. As some have mentioned the toilets are like an airplane one. Its because the hotel is over the water apparently and something to do with the waste or whatever. Forewarned is forearmed. Didnt bother me as it wasnt that noisy. I could NOT fault the cleanliness of the hotel. The bathroom had a lot of chrome and mirrors and it sparkled even down behind the basin which if you have that much mirrors and chrome everywhere Id imagine it would be a nightmare to keep clean.

The suite was also well sized which enabled a number of us to get ready without feeling too cramped and restricted. The lighting for the room was also great- there are so many city based hotels that can be very dim and drab feeling- the Sebel definitely isn't one! The overall service we received was also fabulous- concierge were very helpful with our requests- as we had quite a few! nothing was ever a problem. Room service was also a pleasant suprise- we have breakfast in the room both mornings and the meals were as good as if you were eating in the restaurant- i find room service can often being a lesser standard but this wasn't the case. Many people have commented on the noise of the toilet flush but this simply gave us something to laugh about as it did sound like someone was being sucked down it- but this is the only downside we faced. The bathroom was also huge with beautiful fittings and sparkly clean.

I feel it's more a leisure hotel than business like Sheraton, Westin or Marriott, so there is a good mix of crowd, and weddings going on on week ends. Highlight is location, under Harbour bridge nearby marina, 5mins pleasant walk to Circular Quay. There is small gym, more a workout room. But, running before work around Opera House and botanical garden, no need a gym, that was awsome ! The lobby and restaurant windows are open (this is summer) on the peer, great ! My room was 3rd floor, overlooking harbour, very nice and minismalist design, all cream and white with a beam and a reverse-V shape high ceiling. The building used to be a warehouse of some sort, so there are beams and pillars that gives it an industrial feel that I like, the building has \"personality\", unlike boring usual business hotels. Room is well appointed, iPod-compatible radio clock, flat screen, all usual amenities. Unlike mentioned in another comment read here, internet (broadband, no wifi in rooms) is free - if you join the fidelity program (for free). Very efficient and friendly service, knowledgeable concierge team. As also mentioned in another post here, the toilets can be noisy at times. Toilet \"technology\" is not the usual one, it's like toilets on a plane, so can be a bit noisy indeed, but no worry overall (and cannot hear toilets from other rooms). As a summary, I enjoyed my stay very much and would return. Only downside is the TV: no BBC, no CNN, no HBO, no international channels... only Murdoch crapy Fox news !

It is a short walk to Circular Quay/the Rocks (5mins) and about 10mins to the Opera House. I also walked to the Pitt St Mall daily and that was an easy stroll, though probably 20-25mins. The hotel was fine. I saw the reviews about the toilets on here, and I'm not a very fussy traveller, preferring to find a great deal. For me, the bathroom looked stunning, but there was a lot of noise. The toilets flushing didn't bother me nearly as much as the pipes groaning while in the shower. It is a cute old building so that's fine, but it didn't make me think of five star luxury. The rooms were spotlessly clean. They were small but well laid out. They didn't have a lot of natural light and you couldn't open a window which is a shame. Again - old building. It is nice to stay somewhere with a bit of character rather than a 70s style brick hotel with classic hotel colour scheme - but I probably couldn't stay for more than 2 nights in a place like this. Beds and pillows and room service and amenities all excellent. I slept well though the twin beds were pretty small. This is fine for a quick trip to Sydney. If you are only there a matter of days and want to see a lot and stay in a hotel, reasonably priced , I think it is great. I probably won't stay there again as I have been to Sydney a number of times, and there are so many options I try and stay somewhere near whatever area I want to see.

Front of house staff were extremely helpful, nice, and super professional - couldn't fault them. Not so good: I would have preferred a 2nd floor room as our view was partially blocked by wooden slats, and our balcony door didn't open. There were some odd things about the bathroom: no extractor fan, so we had to leave the doors open when we were showering, so that the mirrors weren't completely steamed up afterwards; a very filthy vent in the roof; bubbles from your shower gel would come up through the plug hole in the floor after a shower - which was right where you'd stand in front of the basin - slippery!; not enough towel/bathrobe hooks in the bathroom - but there were 4 over the mirror in the hall space - so hanging your towels would block that mirror (??!!). Pillows were huge! Hard to sleep on. And every morning at around 7.30-7.45am without fail, we'd be woken by the maids chattering loudly in the hall - where the cleaning room was jammed open. Each morning I would stumble out looking deliberately SLEEPY, and grab the newspaper, after which they would quieten down. Breakfast was good, but I'd recommend just going for the continental and not cooked ($10 extra) which wasn't that appealing. Continental was great. Could have done with being offered more coffee.

On paper this should be a wonderful hotel. However, there is a big \"But\" coming. I stayed at the hotel for a meeting. The room had been pre-booked (and paid for) as a waterfront room. The room allocated was a rather dark room on the first floor with views of the trees and the sandstone wall on the otherside of the road. When the error was pointed out - it was \"oops\" - but we are fully booked. Needless to say I didn't see the room that was booked and am yet to see the refund for the difference between the price of the two rooms. (Knowing the operator I have no doubt that it will come) . The room was a little noisy - the toilet system is like those you find on 'planes - a vacuum system and neighbouring activity risks disturbing you with a rapid \"whoosh\". Closing the door helped, but remembering that the door was shut in the middle of the night created other issues. When shown to the meeting room - it was set up for a wedding not a meeting - oops again. Big scramble in the short time before the meeting. That evening a small group elected to sit on the deck of the hotel and have dinner - the service was patchy, when the white wine arrived it was quite warm, requiring 15 minutes in an ice bucket to get it to drinkable temperature. The food was slow to arrive - it was acceptable, but certainly not to the standard to match the atmoshere. Oops. The same patchiness was repeated at breakfast - no glassware or plates - oops again. The response to requests for these items was unacceptably slow and when delivered they were so hot that it was uncomfortable to handle. Fine for plates, not so for the glass. Oops. There were gaps on the breakfast buffet - oops - scambled eggs when re-filled should have been piping hot, oops they were cold. At least I had a very warm plate. There were several other minor points of irritation - by themselves insufficient to downgrade the rating, but when taken with the other issues illustrative of a hotel that has lost some focus on attention to detail and basic execution skills.

We stayed at the Sebel in January 2010 for 4 nights and said we would definitely be back for more and for longer. So, here we are in January 2011 and we are back! After contacting the hotel staff and letting them know we were returning we were given a great package deal which included breakfast and a Heritage King Room overlooking the harbour. The service and follow-up we received over the phone and by email from Ben and his staff was outstanding and could not be faulted. Well done and thankyou. The big attraction for us with this hotel is its location and the value for money it presents. As tourists the location provides easy access to Circular Quay and its transport hub as well as areas like The Rocks, Sydney CBD and Darling Harbour. The ease of walking to and from the ferries and various eating places and night life is worth a lot in itself and is a factor often overlooked. We find it really easy to fly into Sydney and catch the AirportLink train from the Domestic Terminal to Circular Quay and then walk to the Sebel from there. It takes just 18 minutes on the train from station to station and is stress free. From Circular Quay station you step straight into the atmosphere of the quay and catch your first sight of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Opera House right there in front of you. From there its an easy and exciting short walk (with your bags rolling along behind you) around the quay, under the bridge and in the front door of the hotel. We find it a great way to start our holiday and get right into the 'feel' of Sydney. The room we had was a good size, clean, comfortable and recently refurbished. What more do you need when the delights of Sydney are waiting for you outside? Some people seem to have a problem with the noise the Mirvac tolet system makes when you push the button. Let's take this opportunity to put it in perspective - the noise, yes it is different, but it literally goes for 2 seconds (I timed it!) and then it is completely gone. No hissing of the toilet cistern while it refills, no gurgling water and no 'stuff' flowing through pipes past your room - and it saves water! Enough said! We love the breakfast deal and would recommend it to others for the value and the scenery you can enjoy while eating. How many other hotels allow you to sit on the old wharf front and watch the activities on the harbour unfold while enjoying good food and good service. We always found the staff to be friendly and efficient and always took the time to talk to them. The other great thing we enjoy about this hotel is its 'relaxed formality'. The staff are courteous, efficient and helpful but never in your face. It doesn't have the stuffy feel of some other hotels. If you are into history check out the story of Walsh Bay and spend some time walking in the areas around the hotel and the Rocks. It's well worth it. The beauty of this location is that you are right in the heart of Sydney but away from the hustle and bustle of crowds and traffic. All of that is literally just on the other side of the bridge. Have a look at a map and you will see what we mean. After spending the day out and about it was always relaxing to walk back to the hotel along the waterfont and finish the day with a cocktail or two in the bar. You can feel the serenity! As you have probably guessed by now we love Sydney and we love staying at the Sebel Pier One when we are there. Our thanks to the management and staff for another great holiday. Yes, we will be going back, for sure.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed with lack of quality\u201d", "Author": "SometimesSkiing", "ReviewID": "UR94191241", "Content": "My partner & I stayed at the Sebel, Pier One in Sydney for ten nights over Christmas and New Year 2010, and unfortunately we were far from impressed with the overall experience. Upon checking into our room we immediately noticed a bad smell in the room, which we were told was due to the fact that the room had been \u00e2\u20ac\u0153recently renovated\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, however the smell seemed to be more like that from wet carpet. As we were unpacking, I hung my robe upon a wooden peg in the panelling behind the bed, and the peg promptly fell out of the wall and onto the floor. The trim at the window end of the wooden panelling behind the bed was not fixed in place, and in fact was simply leaning against the window curtains. Attempting to move this away from the window so that the sliding door could be opened resulted in this also falling onto the floor. The blind could not be lowered as the electronic control was not working, and one of the bedside lights was also not working. The light in the wardrobe was completely missing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just a hole in the ceiling where the fitting should have been. Another light in the room had no bulb and was cracked around the ceiling. I attempted to telephone the concierge to report these faults, but to my surprise the telephone was not working either! Upon inspection I discovered that the telephone was not even connected - the cable that should have been plugged into the telephone socket on the wall was coiled up and taped to the underside of the table upon which it stood. I went down and spoke to the concierge in person and was told that the problems would be fixed as soon as possible. Incidentally, whilst most of the faults were subsequently repaired, the trim at the window end of the panelling was not repaired at all during our stay, to my knowledge. We decided to have dinner in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant on our first evening, ordering the pork and the mushroom tart. Once again we were sorely disappointed, the greater part of the pork was simply inedible fat and gristle, and the mushroom tart was so overcooked that the pastry was literally burnt to a crisp. The Duty Manager attempted to correct the electronics that prevented the blinds from closing, TV from working etc, but to no avail and it was decided that Maintenance would be available the following day. This did get corrected. On the following day the hairdryer stopped working after about thirty seconds of use, and on the day after that we noticed that there was water all over the floor in the bathroom. An inspection of the underside of the steel basin revealed that it was not fixed to the bench top at all, and was held in place only by the wastepipe. There was a 2cm gap between the edge of the basin and the bench top, and water was able to pour through this gap when the basin was filled. A maintenance operator came and glued the basin back to the bench top, whereupon water began to leak from the wastepipe at the join. By this time we felt that the room was no longer habitable and requested that we be relocated to another room with a similar harbour view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a view which we had booked and paid for in advance. Before we were relocated we noticed several other faults with the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ceiling was cracked around one of the down lights, some cracked tiles in the bathroom, and there was considerable evidence of mould and rot around the bathroom door. The duty manager found us another similar room on the same floor, but it only had half the view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our initial room had a window which spanned the whole width of the room, whereas the new room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s window was only half the width of the room, a serious impediment to the view we had requested and paid for. The duty manager explained that this was the best he could do under the circumstances as the hotel was near to full occupancy as it was Christmas. I told him that although we accepted his explanation we were far from happy, and that we had documented our grievances, along with photographic evidence where appropriate, and that we would be making Mirvac Hotels aware of these shortcomings. The bad smell we had encountered in our initial room was also evident in the new room. We remained in this room until the end of our stay, and although the accommodation was adequate, it was not quite what we had paid for. Furthermore, the television remote control failed on the second day in the replacement room, and although it was only caused by flat batteries, this added to the general dissatisfaction we were feeling. The television sound quality was awful, particularly on the pay-per-view movies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we paid for three movies during the course of our stay, but had to abandon them on each occasion because of the atrocious sound quality, the dialog being either badly distorted or periodically too low to hear at all. This was evident in both rooms, and would suggest to me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the rediffusion equipment. There were a number of other minor inconveniences too, sometimes the housekeepers forgot to leave wash cloths, or enough towels, or a bath mat, or shampoo... none of these very important when considered separately but when added to the other seemingly never-ending list of complaints you can possibly understand why we were dissatisfied. The iron had a build-up of burned material stuck on it which managed to ruin 2 items of clothing despite attempts to clean it. The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s general manager did invite us to have dinner in the restaurant again, at the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expense, as a measure of apology for the level of inconvenience that we had endured. The meal was enjoyable and we thank the general manager and the respective duty managers for their concern and continued courtesy and apologies. We ordered room service on a few occasions, and the meals and service were of an excellent standard, as were the outstanding buffets on Christmas Day and New Years Eve. We were asked in an email whether we enjoyed our stay at the Sebel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in all honesty we could not give an affirmative reply, neither could we in all conscience consider recommending the hotel to any of our friends and colleagues.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra", "Title": "\u201cOutstanding location but smart design has led to poor function.\u201d", "Author": "PennyH051", "ReviewID": "UR91048856", "Content": "Be prepared for interrupted nights if you, your partner or one of your neighbours uses the toilet.

The first few times were good, the rooms are spacious and the location is great - I guess I didn't really need much as I was only ever there for a night and not much of it. A couple of visits back I revieved the Sebel's feedback email and I notified them that I had found quite alot of hair in the bathroom when I arrived, other than that everything was fine. The next time I visited, the room again had hairs in the bathroom (don't they vacume??) and found that when I went to jump into the big comfy bed, they had stopped putting two sheets on the beds and reverted to just having one sheet and the doona. When I phoned reception to check - the person told me they had stopped putting two on because it meant they had to launder two sheets and a doona cover, now they could save on 1 sheet! I made sure I filled out the feedback card in the room so they knew how I felt. The last time I checked in - again hairs in the bathroom. Normally when we stay we have to leave very early in the morning, but this time when the man at front desk asked me if we were leaving early, we happily replied that for once we didn't, it was our anniversary and we were going to enjoy our first sleep-in in years! Little did we know! We went out for dinner and returned late, hopping into bed (our single sheeted one) at about 1am, knowing that we could sleep until it was time to go. We were woken up at 7.30 am by drilling either above us or next door to us! At first we tried to ignore it, thinking this really couldn't be happening. and by 8.30 my husband got up andphoned reception to check when they thought the drilling would stop. He was told they would find out. 1/2 hour later we phoned again because we hadn't heard anything. Apparently it was outside contractors working on the roof and they couldn't control it. Now really, if the hotel has contractors working on the roof they would know about it and a professional hotel would communicate that to its reservations manager so they could ensure they don't put anyone underneath it. Even more so, I would expect it would be clearly communicated to front office staff so they would be aware of the disturbence. If it had have been communicated - then when we told the man checking us in that we were sleeping in - he could have moved us. Sorry Sebel, this may seem harsh - but I ignored the hairs i the bathrooms on numerous occasions, even dealt with having only 1 sheet, but when you mess with someones sleep, especially when they don't usually get much - its going too far. I did tell the girl at reception that we were not happy and her response was I should fill out a feedback card - but clearly the other times when i have filled out their cards nothing has happened so why should I bother again. I asked her to pass it onto her GM, however I doubt it was passed on. Why is it that big hotels think that feedback forms are the be all and end all - they don't seem to be utilised to help guests and what happend to good old verbal feedback being communicated.

Comment: Recommend you buy the week pass for travel on boat, train and bus....better than the daily rate. Also took the train to Blue Mountain and saved over $100/pp by doing so rather than paying for a tour. The Hunter valley wine tour was good -- if you want to see Boutique Wineries.

We stayed at the Fairmont in Singapore which is 4 star. It was fantastic and set my expectations. I had read the reviews of Pier One and Trail Finders in the UK booked this for me. We arrived at the hotel after a 9 hour flight from Singapore. The room we were given was dank, dirty.......my tummy is turing thinking about it. Firstly there was a burnt orange armchair with a calico cover (Ikea like) which had large stains on it. It was disgusting. The dark blue carpet was stained and dank looking. My first thought was how will I put my bare feet down on this. The furniture was old and damaged. The glass tops were filthy. The towels in the bathroom were frayed and torn. The air vent in the bathroom also had inches of old dust and hairs hanging from it. I immediately asked to change rooms. The duty manager showed me another room that was frankly worse. I called trailfinders in the UK to see if they could help me out. In the end I had to stay in the first room. Now for the next shock.............the bedding was damp. The following morning I spoke to Ben the duty manager. I brought a torn towel with me as evidence. Ben was to say the least a bit ignorant. He told that they had identified that the hotel needed a refurbishment. While I agreed that was out of his control I stated that the cleaning was easily within his remit. The hotel is apparently a Hertiage building built in 1865. Fantastic I told him, come to Europe and we can show you to do old and clean. The common areas are tatty and unclean too. I was moved to another room which Ben oversaw the cleaning of. It was cleaner alright but the rust on the venetian blinds, toilet roll holder and shower pole made it difficult to enjoy a shower (and yes it was a curtain). This was the most expensive hotel i stayed in on my holiday. Please do not stay here until they have done the refurbishment they have identified! Identified it was blantantly obvious. This ruined my stay in Sydney and both my patner & I felt dirty whilst there. We need the Bonza Bike tour (absolutely fantastic) and they told us that the hotel had been flooded a couple of weeks before we arrived. Now I understood by the bedding felt dank. It was a very bad expensive experience. This is not 4 and half stars. It was like a very old dirty outdated Travel Lodge (forgive Travel lodge). I will refrain from starting on the breakfast. I paid in total \u00c2\u00a313,000 sterling for my holiday so you can see I was not scrimping. So Sebel Pier One. I hope you are ashamed of yourselves.

The hotel is just on the far side of the Rocks and right beside the Harbour Bridge. Half the rooms face out and look onto the harbour. Location is great as it is just a 5 minute walk to the rocks and a very short 2 minute stroll to look over to the Opera House. If you have any worries about the location, then don't as it is vet close to the Rocks. Room was very clean, tidy, plush and with all the amenities. Air con was quiet. Staff were very friendly and polite. Restaurant and bar were reasonably priced and you could get bar meals as well as eat in the restaurant. Breakfasts were brilliant and probably the best I have seen in any hotel anywhere in the world. The selection was massive and even had things like fresh passion fruit and Yakult drinks. Restaurant and bar over looked the harbour and you could sit right on the pier front, which was very relaxing way to watch the sun go down. In another review someone mentioned that the toilets were noisy!! They completely forgot to mention that the toilets environmentally friendly are a designed to use something like half the water of a normal toilet. The noise lasts for about 2 seconds and then are totally silent, unlike a normal toilet that makes a noise for a few minutes as it is refilling. This hotel is very quiet and you can hear absolutely no noise from the bridge even when sitting outside on the pier. Really could not recommend enough. I would go back like a flash.

Having stayed in Sydney on a few previous occasions (but in different hotels/apartments) I was well aware of how handy the location of this hotel would be to access areas like Circular Quay, The Rocks, CBD and Darling Harbour to name a few. Literally 50metres from the front door of the hotel and you are standing at the waters edge looking at the magnificent Sydney Harbour and Opera House, not to mention looking up and seeing one of the great icons of Australia, the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Being within casual strolling distance of the ferries,trains and buses at Circular Quay is a huge bonus if you don't want to be driving a car around Sydney. All are within 5 minutes walking time (10 minutes if you chill out and enjoy the sights and sounds at a slower pace) from the hotel. This short walk is a great way to start and finish your day of sightseeing, no matter what time of the day or night it might be. You have probably guessed by now we were impressed by the location! The hotel and its facilities provide excellent value for money and is one we found more enjoyable to stay in than some of the much more expensive and 'stuffy' 5 star hotels around. Whilst the rooms are not large they are very well appointed, comfortable, and above all, clean. We spent most of our days enjoying the sights of Sydney and only needed the room to sleep and recharge before heading out to do it all again. Why stay in your room when you can sit out on the pier and relax and take in the views? We found all staff members to be friendly, courteous and helpful (with no exceptions). If you offer a smile and a friendly greeting it's amazing what responses you get when dealing with people! Some travellers should try it - it's not that hard to do. The breakfast deal at the hotel is an absolute bargain! We had the full breakfast each day and that provided our fuel to get us through most of the day. If you don't want to eat at the hotel there are plenty of eating places in the Quay and Rocks areas or at a couple of the local pubs within a short stroll. Watch out for the rabbits under the bridge on your way to the Harbour View Hotel, and the bats flying overhead at dusk (yes really!). All in all, GREAT holiday, GREAT location.

During our short stay the service in the restaurant was very slow with the staff inattentative and failing to respond to requests for service. In the end we tired of waiting and went to the bar to get our own drinks. Similarly, a request for towels from housekeeping staff was ignored. We were also concerned that the airconditioning controls, radio station and side mirrors of our car - left overnight at the Sebel's parking lot - had been altered by valet staff. We did complain about the car (only) and the Duty Manager advised that he would investigate the matter on our behalf. Because the hotel is literally sitting on the harbour we booked a waterview room. A word of warning to future travellers - the window in the Heritage room we had on level one was so high that you had to be standing directly in front of the window to see the water - very difficult for short people. Only the sky is visible when you walk around the room or sit down in front of the window.

Unfortunately, I have very little to add in the way of positive feedback as my experience was nothing short of abysmal. The Sebel appears to have serious defects in its plumbing system. Rooms on the second floor of the hotel were flooded as a result of recent rainfalls. One colleague even had what appeared to be sewerage spilling out from a drain in the bathroom! I was awoken very early one morning to loud screaming. As it turned out, one of the guests had been electrocuted from the hairdryer. I am also aware of other guests (including myself) being electrocuted from the applicances. The hotel rooms were small and oddly shaped. Whilst they were well appointed, the state of the fittings was poor. In one particular case a guest reported that the shelves in her wardrobe had been held together with masking tape and when she opened the cupboard doors all the shelves collapsed! I found that the conference rooms themselves were ill-equipped for business conferences - airconditioning was inconsistent and the accoustics appauling. This seemingly endless series of unfortunate events was promtly brought to the attention of hotel staff who simply chose to ignore the complaints that were made or were at times hostile in their response. . Overall, I walked away from the experience extremely disappointed and would strongly discourage any intending guests to reconsider selecting the Sebel as their choice of accommodation. Sebel Pier One has some serious structural flaws which should be addressed urgently otherwise it will only be a matter of time before someone is seriously injured. In addition, the staff should be more responsive to any complaints that are made rather than choosing to ignore them or view them as comical.", "Date": "July 31, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cNot quite 5 Star\u201d", "Author": "duchess_bvlgari", "ReviewID": "UR18441868", "Content": "I thought I would surprise my then fiance with a weekend trip to Sydney and chose Pier One for its location.

The staff we encountered (room service, front desk, bar staff) were exceptional. The slightly odd and noisy plumbing was slightly irritating but certainly not enough to put us off the hotel. Unfortunately the whole experience was marred by the terrible housekeeping service. Day one (we stayed for 4 nights), the room was cleaned adequately but not to a standard you would expect from a hotel of this level. Day two, I requested a change of sheets (request required in keeping with hotel's green policy) as there was a hole in one of the sheets. When we returned in the evening the bed was made to look like there were clean sheets but discovered the exact same hole in the sheet when I went to bed. Nothing else was cleaned in the room, bin were not emptied, drawers left open, toiletries/glasses/washcloths not refreshed and the towels left on the floor for replacement were still there. Day three the room was not touched at all - unfortunately we returned too late in the evening from our day out to raise it with the front desk. While 1-2 day sheets and towels can't be considered a hardship, it is certainly not what you expect from a 4-5 star hotel.

Because the hotel is basically by itself on Pier One, there are no restaurants around (except the hotel restaurant) without a 10 minute walk to the Rocks.

It is a fairly good location as you are literally right under the Harbour Bridge in The Rocks, however slightly away from the centre of things. There are some lovely restaurants & bars all around, but you have search for them. It is best to set out for dinner early ie 6-7pm, as most restaurants close their doors at 9-10pm. Reservations are recommended. The area along the other piers is being developed into an up & coming place to be. We arrived on 30th at noon, disappointed to find that our room was not yet ready, so instead took ourselves off to get our barings. When our room was ready, it was a modern room, nicely decorated , with large bathroom & view of the underside of the Harbour Bridge. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, which was good if a little pricey. Circular Quay is about a 10-15min walk (depending which way you go), we went along the Harbour front, past the imposing building of the Hyatt Hotel. It is so lovely to see a fully operational Harbour at work. Circular Quay is a busy ferry port taking people across the Harbour to Manly, on short trips to Bondi or for a leisurely afternoon cruise. We decided to do a reckie for a good view point for the New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve fireworks. A friend had recommended Mrs Macquarie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point. We walked through the Botanical Gardens, looking at the amazing examples of trees, flowers & at the huge bats hanging high above our heads & then exited to get to Mrs Macquarie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Point. Our vantage point for the fireworks was right opposite the Sydney Opera House with the Harbour Bridge in the background. New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve is such a well organised event in Sydney. We decided we would get to our spot early & take a picnic with us. You can bring you own food but not alcohol, there is food & alcohol available to purchase. We went to the famous department store, David Jones Food Hall to stock up on goodies & then headed to Mrs Macquarie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Point. If you ever get to go to Sydney over New Year - the fireworks are a MUST! Absolutely unbelievable! From Sebel Pier, you can watch people taking the heady climb up to Harbour Bridge, it looked like a challenge so we decided to conquer our fears & do it too. The climb & induction lasts about 3.5 hours and the views are breathtaking. I was slightly wary of the whole thing but I can assure anyone with any concerns that it is extremely safe & not one bit scary! Other sights to see are the Aquarium - brilliant, Darling Harbour - lots to do & see & great bar called Bungalow 8 - fab food, Oz Tower - great views, Oz Trek - slightly dated but still fun, Opera House Tour - really interesting, Manly Beach - Lovely beach, great eatery called Rib & Rump (If you love your meat this is the place for you!)
