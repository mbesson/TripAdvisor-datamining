I am here on business first and foremost so location wise for my clients and staff this is perfectly located, not sure in the grand scheme of visiting Istanbul how well located it would be but for my purpose location is ok. The rooms are clean enough, if a little dated in design and presentation, as a seasoned business traveller i would say it is in line with the 110 euros per night i am paying to stay here but not worth any more than that. Pros as i see them 1) well located 2) clean and tidy 3) located right next to a huge shopping mall which is very modern and has lots of shops - a handy bridge leads to within 200 yards of it Cons as i see them (which unfortunately outweigh the pros) 1) No alcohol served here - at first i thought this wasnt going to be a problem as i thought a few days detox that will be great, but funny thing is when you know you cant get it, you want it even more! i find myself gagging for a cold beer at the end of the day but knowing i cant get one! 2) the internet is so tightly restricted i cant even look at any website remotely outside of their strict firewall. and as a solo traveller with not much to do, not even leenks works (which isnt porn by the way- even though every site i have tried so far has not worked! may aswell be honest! haha) 3) the front of house staff say the right things but dont act on them, 4 times i asked for simple information with the promise of a call back only to find myself chasing them up 4) the breakfast buffet is one of the strangest mixes of foods ive witnessed! am i being culturally insensitive when i say \"who on earth eats a full green salad for breakfast\" i bet there will be a deluge of morning salad eaters contacting me now. 5) if you are English (or use English as your main spoken language - the same for any language outside Turkish, then forget watching TV, one channel (BBC f'ing news!!) and fashion TV who lets be honest, nobody watches!! 55 channels, all turkish with the exception of RTL, TV1 and BBC News.

Took breakfast this morning and found it a bit odd, in a good way, I think. First, I was comfortably out-numbered by staff desperate, it would seem, for something to do. That meant I got that weird over-attentive type service where every spent tea-spoon is whipped away the second it hits the table. The breakfast selection, on the other hand, bordered on bewildering. Very large choice of salads, cheeses, fruit, breads, pastries, hot stuff in tureens, juices and ... quails eggs of all things. Not standard western european/american choices, but very good.

Hence, my impressions of Byotell are colored by the previous experiences at the other hotel. First of all, the air conditioning works very well. Also, the hotel is in a modern glass and concrete (or marble) building, close to a major highway, but in a nice area, that has a safe feel to it. There is a pedestrian bridge across the highway, within a few hundred feet from the hotel, which takes you to a major shopping mall, whichhas many restaurants within a short walk - none of the underbelly feel of the other hotel. I liked the fact that my room also had a window that opens out, despite the office-tower look of the building. I must say that Byotell presents a different take on the luxury hotel - it is very contemporary, with the room decor that combines warmth and modernity, with a hint of middle-eastern opulence.. My room was much smaller than at the other hotel, but it was quite adequate foro one person, and would do for a coupe, too. According to the floor plan which i checked for location of fire escape (a good idea for anyone), this is the smallest room on the floor (xx01), i.e. another room will be bigger. The furniture arrangement is well thought out and the closet by the entrance provides enough storage. There were 3 armchairs in the room, which, while not super plush, were nonetheless comfortable to spend long hours working in. The hotel provides wired (not wireless) Internet, which apparently costs extra (though it was included in the negotiated rate that my customer enjoys with them). The bathroom is nice and spacious, with modern, high-end fixtures. The towels are thick and substantial (though they could have been a bit softer). The bathroom greets the visitor with the various toiletries - there are tubes of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, and bath crystals, all different color, for a very nice visual impression. The bed is comfortable, but a bit hard for my liking (though I am spoiled with my tempur-pedic bed at home). My room had only a 19 (or so) inch TV. However, it had around 30 channels working, and unlike the other place, which only had a BBC News channel of English-language programs, this one had BBC, CNN, and Bloomberg news, as well as the CNBC (I think), broadcasting US entertainment programs in English, albeit with Turkish subtitles. There is a number of German(3), French(2), Italian, Greek, Spanish channels, a Russian channel, and 2-3 programs in Arabic. Indeed, the hotel caters to the Islamic sensibilities - it does not serve alcohol, neither in the restaurants, nor in the mini-bar, so if you are a drinker, you will not be able to indulge - the restaurants do not serve vine with the meals, and the top floor, which clearly was set up as a bar, stays empty. Even the mini-bar in the room contains sodas and juices, but no beer or liquor. I am not sure how they would react if a guest brought his own alcohol and they saw it, but I am sure with a bit of discretion, one could easily work around their setup. Still, it is a small price to pay for the otherwise nice accommodations that the hotel provides. Hotel information says that they do it out of concern for the patrons' health - there is a health club and spa in the hotel - but at the same time, they do allow smoking, so they can't be too concerned aobut visitors' well-being. There are 2 restaurants open for lunch and dinner, which seem to be really a one restaurant - they share the menus and staff. They have a slightly different decor, and one is non-smoking. In my experience, it stayed empty most of the time (although I am a non-smoker, I did not want to be completely by myself in a dining room). The food is good, with many local choices. The breakfast buffet is very nice, with wide selection of cheezes, cereals, baked items, and local hot dishes. There is no made-to-order omlette/egg station, and it is perhaps a notch below the other place, but overall, there is more selection than one can try in a few days. Like in the other hotel, there is no alarm clock in the room, so you would do well to bring your own. The outlets are all local (two rounded prongs), but the front desk was kind enough to give me an adapter. They also give out Internet cables to the guests. The staff is very friendly, and the customer service is a notch above the rest. I have ordered a wake-up call, and on two occasions I did not hear the phone ring. They had actually sent somebody up to my room to knock on the door to make sure I was awake. I have never seen this before. The second time it happened was on the morning I was to check out, which allowed me to make it to the airport on time, even if with some regret about leaving this neat place.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cNice Stay\u201d", "Author": "thehappyvoyager", "ReviewID": "UR20694956", "Content": "I have just returned home from a long-weekend stay at the Byotell in \u00c4\u00b0stanbul, and my overall experience is good!
