This hotel is perfect for those that want to be in the middle of it all, and still have a comfortable, modern, safe and clean room to return to at the end of the day. Reception staff were great - so friendly and speak very good english. I had a really spacious double room that faced the street, and it was very quiet. There is a safe in the room, wifi is also free and connection is good. I would definately recommend this hotel. Also the price was really good for the quality and location of this place - I don't think you will find much better than this in central Barcelona.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel, very polite staff\u201d", "Author": "styliani p Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126572858", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay there.

It is located just a few minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya and offers basic but very clean and comfortable accomodation. My room was very small, but ok if you want just a place to sleep. The ensuite bathroom was tiny, too. But everything was very clean and, although a bit old, kept in good condition. The room was facing a lightshaft, therefore it was more or less isolated from the noise of the street, but down there was a restaurant kitchen, so it was not useful to open the window, otherwise you would think you sleep in a deep fryer ;) (But AC worked perfectly and filtered out the smells). The hotel has no breakfast option available, which isn't a big issue, as you are in the heart of Barcelona and sorrounded by Caf\u00e9s, Bars and whatever you crave for. They don't offer any wifi in the hotel, which could be a little odd. But on Las Ramblas, you can take advantage of Barcelonas free Wifi offer. It is a very safe location, as the entrance door of the hotel is always locked and a member of staff has to open it for you. The hotel itself occupies two floors in a office/residential building, therefore it can be not that easy to find for the first time. I would recommend it for anybody who is just looking for a clean and safe place to sleep in a great location.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than what we were expecting - would recommend!\u201d", "Author": "VintageLover1", "ReviewID": "UR116017159", "Content": "We booked this hotel fully aware of its low star rating, but were pleasently surprised. We really only wanted a place to sleep and shower, therefore room size, availability of breakfast etc were not considerations for us. The room was a pretty decent size, however, especially conidering it was in the city, and there were plenty of places close by for breakfast - our favourite was Cafe Zurich just up the street. The reception staff were lovely, even though it was after midnight when we checked in due to our bus from the airport breaking down. They were also more than willing to answer questions we had regarding the area, how to get to places etc, and on two ocassions printed timetables and attraction details for us. All three men on reception had varying degrees of English, which was great as we did not have any Spanish, let alone Catalan. We were able to leave our bags at reception on our last day for as long as we wanted after check out. Although they do not have a luggage room, the bags were in front of the desk, and so still pretty safe. The room was made up daily, with fresh towels, and the bathroom was cleaned, which we were quite surprised at, as I have stayed in four star hotels in Ireland where this has not been done. The bathroom was a little stale on arrival the first night, but this was more to do with bing hut up in the heat than issues with cleanliness, and by the time it had been freshened up by the cleaning staff the next day it was fine. The room did not seem to have adjustable airconditioning, something maybe people who are not great with heat should consider, although for us the more heat the better! The location of the hotel is fantastic! It is a minutes walk from Las Ramblas - the main street, and Plaza de Catatunya, the main square. It is somewhat noisy due to its location, but most city centre hotels are, and if you are a good sleeper, it should not be an issue. In the evening and during the night you have to be buzzed in from the street, and buzzed in to the hotel. I note other reviewers have deemed this a bit hostle-y, but we thought it was great as it gave extra security to a city centre hotel! Additionally, as there seems o be always someone on reception, you don't have to wait. The staff also seemed to get to know guests pretty quickly, and used to have our key out and on the desk for us by the time we walked in. You can rent a safe in the room, which we did, for \u20ac2 per night, which we felt was worth it. So all in all, while maybe not suited to the luxury of romance, for a city break for three friends or a couple or a family who want a great location, it was ideal - definitely consider it! PLACES/ATTRATIONS I LOVED - Font de Magique (Magic fountain, free - fountain show set to lights and music, amazing).....Sagrada de Famillia (\u20ac13.50 when we were there incl lift ticket, amazing views from the top, stil under construction, beautiful inside and out, achitectural attention to detail excellent)..... Pura Brasa (Restaraunt near Font de Magique - very reasonable prices, we went back on our last night).....Mercat de Boqueria (Food market, fab fresh fruit and veg etc). P.S. There is a lift on the first floor, but I doubt this hotel would really be wheel-chair accessible, as you have to go up steps to get to this lift. Not a prob if a person was with others, but could be an issue for someone on their own.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cForget the \"breakfast\"\u201d", "Author": "tcroft", "ReviewID": "UR115204403", "Content": "Centrally located, and easy walk to sights but very small room.

We paid 100euros/night for a triple with shower and breakfast was included. It was raining when we first arrived in Barcelona and there was another hotel with a very similar name (though I can't remember it off the top of my head) on the same street. We accidently went there initially - but were redirected to the right place. To get to the reception of the hotel you have to be buzzered into the actual building - it looks like there are about 3 or 4 other business there. Then its up a flight of stairs to the lift, then on the first floor is the reception area - again you need to buzzer in. Pros - our room had a balcony - looking at the floor plan i think its the only room there with a balcony. - location location location! right near placa catalunya and near 2 underground stations - huge room Cons - initial problems when checking in despite me having an emailed confirmation; this was sorted out fairly quickly though (they thought i had booked for a double and not a triple) - initial problems with the toilet - it wasn't flushing - again quickly sorted out when brought to the attention of the staff. Other points worth mentioning: - breakfast consists of a hot drink from an automated machine and packaged pastries. there is no place to eat it really so we took it back to our room.

We arrived at Hotel Pelayo after five days of high action touring, which started in Madrid. Prior to our arrival, I knew little more than the location of the Hotel Pelayo - in the heart of the city near Plaza Catalu\u00f1a. I had contact via internet with a couple from Barcelona who owned a business near Plaza Catalu\u00f1a. They were not familiar with the Pelayo Hotel and were unable to give me any details about what to expect. It was really a very nice hotel. Not upscale and luxurious in modern sense, but it was very low key and comfortable. Our room was dark, we had a view of a non-descript court yard. Another room within our group had a view of the street below with an opened balcony. That was a very nice extra. The dining area was in the basement. We were served sit down dinners and buffet breakfast. The foods seemed a little too much like food from home, example: mashed potatoes served with what we would consider to be breakfast sausage. Some members of our group opted to pay to eat outside the hotel just to get a sample of the local cuisine. We enjoyed the little lobbies on each floor. The kids sat there and talked while taking a break. They also sat in the basement lobby, perhaps it was a bar area. There they had a birthday party with cake for one of our girls. We were seldom aware of other occupants of this hotel. We ate at preassigned intervals, we seldom saw other occupants in the hallways and lobbies. Perhaps we saw others at the front desk, but it was a very small entrance and front desk and one only saw a very few people.
