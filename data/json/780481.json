The apartment was really spacious which 3 different bedrooms , a nice little kitchen and a huge living room with a balcony opening to the main road. The room had 2 bathrooms one ensuite and the other being common. There is a rooftop swimming pool, which looked good , however we never managed to find time to take a dip. They also have a gym on the roof top which is not great. The breakfast was inclusive and was a spread of 5-6 items. The good thing being there were sufficient options for vegertarians. The location is really good just off the main \"Bank street\" in Bur Dubai and behind the famous Burjuman mall. However the loaction makes sense only if u r interested in heritage and culture and want to get a feel of the real old dubai. Gold Souk is quite close if u take \"abra\" to cross over. We felt the staff was a bit ill equipped coming up with suggestions on night clubs / pubs / eating joints. So my suggestion is to plan ur stuff ahead and best to chk with friends (if any) in dubai.

The apartment was large, clean, and modern with a large balcony, and two bathroom areas. The kitchen area is well equipped and the fridge is a good one. You get a large plasma TV in the lounge and in the master bedroom, plus a DVD player in the master bedroom. We got a good rate although the exchange rate dropped like a stone during our visit, so it will cost us more than we expected. Check in was easy and staff were efficient. I had a problem working the freeview/satellite box and staff were up quickly to help me out. There is no tea/coffee in the room which surpised me as the previous apartment hotel I stayed in did provide it as complimentary. Breakfast used to be served in the rooms but now it is downstairs in the small coffee shop. Only made it for one day, as it finishes at 10 am. It was OK and seemed to go on longer.... The hotel is located on a side street fairly close to supermarkets, restaurants, fast food joints etc. Getting a taxi in our experience is not easy anywhere in Bur Dubai. We really struggled to get taxis outside the hotel, and had more success walking up towards the Ramada Hotel about 10 minutes walk. A previous thread talks about a hotel driver. I never checked this out, but it would possibly be worth considering instead of taxis, depending on the rates on offer. Broadband internet is in the room. Never checked this out, we used an internet cafe on Al Mussala Road (Changes from Mankhool Road) and leads to Bastakiya. There are a few on this road and the one we used was 2 dirhams per hour!! Locationwise is good for the Dubai Museum, Bastakiya, the Dubai souk and Abra stations to the main souks in Deira. A 15-20 minute walk to these areas. In mid October this was feasible but during hotter times you would need a taxi if you are not used to the heat. This is not a tourist area, but a bustling, busy city centre. There are however, a large number of apartment hotels in this location, so price competition will always be good. For everything else in Dubai, (e.g. the beach, resort hotels etc), taxis are required and are well priced when you can get them. There is a rooptop area with a small pool, chairs, loungers etc, and a small gym and sauna area. My only problem with the room was that in the smaller bedroom there was a constant dull noise coming from above on the roof. This was not a problem in the master bedroom. I assume this was the hotel air conditioning units. This was continuous throughout the night and towards the end of the stay was getting irritating. I used ear plugs in the end. This would only be a problem if you were (ironically) in the exec apartments on the top floor! We were in a corner apartment (707) so this may be an isolated problem. Housekeeping were OK, but a little inconsistent. They often did not replace the shower gel in my bathroom....and sometimes did the washing up and other times not. Did not empty the bin initially as I guess they did not know it was there....hidden under the sink! I tipped them a couple of times but it didn't seem to make a difference either way.", "Date": "October 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lagos", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to be,Single and Family\u201d", "Author": "basiudosenLagos", "ReviewID": "UR16964039", "Content": "Great Place for an organized single or family, Very Central, 10-15mins from Dubai Int'l Airport, Fully fitted and clean accomodations,Great Staff,Family Treatment.

This property in under new ownership and has been fully refurbished recently, so everything is new and luxurious. We arrived at the hotel many hours before check-in time, approx 5am. Surprisingly we were able to check-in right away without any problems. We were accommodated in a three bedroom apartment on the 5th floor. The apartment is very spacious in size. It has a balcony ( No tables and chairs unfortunately), kitchen with all utensils you would ever need, microwave, fridge/freezer, washing machine, TV, free view box (not many channels), DVD player (audio CDs are playable), dining table with four chairs, one three seat sofa, two sofa chairs, coffee table. The master bedroom has a king bed which has separate access to the balcony and is ensuite. There is no shortage of storage space; I actually kept forgetting where I placed my stuff as there where two many wardrobes.lol. The other two bedrooms are twin, each with separate bathrooms. The apartment was very comfy and modern. We had a very nice view of the Rolex towers from the balcony. The hotel is located behind the burjuman centre. It is a short walk to Bank Street, two spinneys outlets, McDonalds, KFC, Hardees, Meena Bazaar and many banks/ATMS. The hotel is located in a very ideal place and is walking distance to many places. Oh yea, it\u2019s also a five minutes\u2019 walk to the creek. The hotel has a rooftop swimming pool for kids and adults, a gym and a steam room. It\u2019s nothing to write home about though. There is a cafe located on the ground floor. It\u2019s absolutely disgusting and I would recommend not eating there, that is the nicest I can be in regard to the cafe. The staffs at this hotel are so genuine and caring. Never nosey and always there when you need them, just the right blend. They just couldn\u2019t do more for us. I would defiantly recommend Arif, the driver. He knows Dubai inside out and is available most of the time. He drives a land cruiser (very nice). I advise using the car service from the hotel as getting taxis was such a headache for us. It actually works out cheaper driving about with Arif for the day instead of jumping taxis. Free broadband was also available in our apartment. The downside to the hotel is the cafe, gym, swimming pool, and the air-conditioning makes a lot of noise at night, but I would still recommend this place over many other places in Dubai.", "Date": "November 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Symphony Hotel Apartments", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g295424-d780481-Reviews-Symphony_Hotel_Apartments-Dubai.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">24 B St</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">PO Box 125335</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Dubai</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">United Arab Emirates</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "780481", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/be/ba/3b/symphony-hotel-apartments.jpg"}}
