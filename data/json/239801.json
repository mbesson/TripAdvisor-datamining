I called the front desk to send housekeeping over, and also to get a replacement light bulb. The guy delivering the light bulb was pleasant, but the housekeeper was definitely not pleased about having to do more work, and made this very clear. The toilet runs for a long time, but this shouldn't bother you as it is drowned out by the very noisy A/C unit in the room. I would not touch the kitchen cabinets and washed all plates and silverware before using. The room had a kitchen table/island made of chipped formica, and an endtable that appeared to have been gnawed or eaten - presumably by someone's pet hopefully, rather than a previous guest! The location was pretty good, but that's really about the only positive thing I can say about this place. To top it off, a nearby guest put their used pizza box and empty drinks outside of their room, where they stayed partially blocking the walkway for 3-4 days. I guess it was a standoff to see who would make the gruelling 12 ft. trip to the nearby garbage cans first - the guest or the staff. Do a bit more research - there are definitely better extended stay places in Phoenix than this one!", "Date": "March 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cTerrible, awful place. Worst place I have ever stayed at.\u201d", "Author": "Raiderfan0", "ReviewID": "UR97200809", "Content": "I made a reservation almost 3 weeks in advance of arriving for what was planned to be a 2 week stay at this location. When we arrived there were signs taped to both entrance doors that said \"sold out, no rooms available\". We were told that our non smoking reservation had been changed to a smoking reservation. I even showed the clerk my confirmation from the Studio 6 website. She told me, that is the only room we have left, no apology, no offer to fix it the next day, just take it or leave it. I figured I could get it fixed the next day, so we checked in and went to the room. The room smelled horrible, as I figured it would, since it was a smoking room. The carpet had nasty stains everywhere. The couch had it's own unique bad smell. The A/C filter was filthy. There were crumbs all along the bed frame (on the floor), so it was obvious cleanliness was not a top priority for this place. There was a picture above the headboard, which someone had placed a sticker on, no employee bothered to remove. There was human hair on the floor in the kitchen and in the bathroom, as well as in the shower. The bedspread had stains all over it. The bed was old and uncomfortable, and made noise anytime you moved while on it. The first thing we did was try to use the toilet, and it wouldn't flush. Well, I noticed that I had been overcharged at check in, so I took my confirmation email with me to the office to get a plunger for the toilet, and to get refunded the amount I was overcharged. Before I did that, I called the Studio 6 guest relations number to ask if it was their policy to guarantee non smoking reservations (not change them to smoking), the lady I spoke with told me that yes, it was their policy not to change guaranteed reservations to smoking. She called it the no smoking guarantee policy. So, with this information in mind, I went to the office to take care of these issues. First issue I brought up was the toilet, I believe she was the Assistant Manager (not the Operations Manager), that asked me, \"well, what did you do to it\"? I thought she was joking so I laughed it off, but she didn't smile or let on that she was joking, so I took that as she was being serious. Then I brought up that I had been overcharged by $70.00, the clerk was really confused as to how to fix this. She went back to the office where the Assistant Manager had run off to go eat. She returned, then tried to do something in the computer, and then went to the back again. This happened three more times. Finally, the Assistant Manager came out to fix the problem. No apology at all. So finally, I brought up that I had called the corporate office and asked about the no smoking reservation policy. The clerk went to the back office again to talk to the Assistant Manager. The Assistant Manager, loudly said (with food in her mouth from the back office) \"we don't guarantee anything but a bed and four walls\". The tone of her voice was that of annoyance. The clerk then returned to the front where I was and repeated what the Assistant Manager had yelled to me. I was completely shocked by the service I was receiving, and then asked if maintenance would come to look at the toilet. I was told the maintenance person was gone, but that they would get me a plunger. I waited for what seemed an eternity, and finally the clerk returned with a plunger. I could barely get the toilet to flush, but I decided we would leave the next day anyway. If only to help solidify my decision to leave the next day, at 2am the refrigerator (which is part of the bedroom), started making an extremely loud sound about every 30 minutes. This sound kept waking us up, as it would go on for about 5-10 minutes. Don't get me started on the other people staying at this place, they were very shady looking characters. There were people running up and down the stairs all night. People standing outside our room and smoking all hours of the night. They have a security guard, but the guard apparently was never in the right place at the right time. The next morning I saw broken glass in several places in the parking lot. We packed up at 9am, received our refund and left. We drove 25 miles to the Studio 6 in Tempe, AZ, which is in an infinitely better place to stay.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Phoenix, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cYuk!\u201d", "Author": "DanRanTravel", "ReviewID": "UR81515977", "Content": "We made a reservation two weeks in advance only to find that the accommodations we requested were given to someone else.

It was not clean -- sticky surfaces on the counter tops. The coffeemaker was dirty and stained. We had reserved a 2 bed room, which they did not have. Gave us one bed and a single pull out bed, both of which were lumpy (so were the pillows). There was no bedding for the pullout, so we had to go to the office to get it. Only one person was working on the property, so he did not come to the room with the bedding. The pullout was right next to the air conditioner/heater which blew air all night. The windows were cracked above the locks, fortunately ours was a 2nd floor end unit so the window was not reachable from the outside, as most are. The towels were stiff and thin. There was no shampoo. This is the only motel I have ever stayed in where they expect you to empty your own trash.
