The price is not so high because of the district: lots of sex shops and loud bars. But it's safe and does not disturb a lot, I as a tourist spend the whole day in other districts. Ones again want to point on a very good service: ordering tickets to the opera with necessary recommendations. Moreover I had a small trouble: while cleaning the room maid threw away a big plastic bag with all my beauty products like hair treatment, full cosmetic bag, medicals, etc. The bag was standing on the floor of the bathroom and maid thought it was rubbish. Of course, I mentioned the whole situation at the reception. My next morning's first visit was to beauty department of the large shop where I bought everything. To my surprise on the day of my departure the hotel compensate the whole amount of my beauty purchases with apologizes!", "Date": "May 19, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR602164897", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d278203-r22829634-Rex_Hotel_Sydney-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "HotelID": "278203", "Price": "$170"}}
