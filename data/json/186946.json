Very strange for a hotel these days. Even without any upgrade surely a bit of customer service would have been to put some fruit in the room or give us a voucher for a drink at the pub? But nothing. Then the room, tiny, not sure where \"Executive\" comes into it??? They put us on the 8th floor with a lovely view of the alley and rooms opposite, and naked old men watching TV on their beds, they just knew how to make it special for me lol! Then the elevator - only one working, the other closed for maintenance for the whole 6 days we were there, we did try the stairs (yes from the 8th floor) but ended up in a very dark alley after climbing down stairs that had broken beds on them. So decided to wait for the elevator from then on. Housekeeping, not friendly, even though we tipped every day, but she did give us some extra coffee.

Reception was ok when we checked out, kept our bags for a couple of hours, concierge was ok when we booked a Niagara tour through him but never acknowledged again.

On this occasion, my wife and I had tickets to 2 Leafs games, thus we needed accomodations for 3 nights. For some reason, I couldn't get a significant discount for all 3 nights on either site. On the advice of a friend, I contacted the Strathcona to inquire about rates. I ended up speaking with a Manager named Brendan who was able to answer all my questions regarding the hotel. I ended up booking 2 rooms for myself and a couple of friends of mine that were joining us on the trip for a very reasonable rate. I knew that the hotel didn't have their own parking garage, but being somewhat comfortable in the city, I knew of many parking garages in the area. I ended up finding one within a 5 minute walk to the hotel. Having never been in the hotel, I was quickly relieved to see a very clean and modern Lobby, and check in was a breeze thanks to the very friendly staff on hand. Regarding the staff at the desk, I had to call on them twice during our stay when my wife and i had issues with our card, and they were always super friendly and very helpful. The room we had was on the 11th floor (1117) and it was very clean , and nicely decorated. Sure the rooms are on the small side, but we basically just needed somewhere to hang our hat and sleep. The beds are very comfortable, and although small, the bathrooms were nice and modern. There is a pub located in the basement, which is very cozy, and has great food. The gentleman serving us on both nights was very friendly, and the drinks were very much enjoyed. The best thing about the Strathcona is the location. We were across the street from Union Station, which pretty much gives you access to the whole city. Seeing as though we were there for 2 hockey games, we were a 5 minute walk to the ACC and Rogers Centre/CN tower. There is also many many great restaurants and pubs in the area. The location is the best! If I had to list some negatives, I would have to say that due to it's location, and shape, many rooms have no view. For some that might be an issue, but as mentioned, I was there to explore the city, not sit in my room and look out the window. Also, I found the wi-fi to be a little on the slow side. Not sure why. lastly, there is only ice and vending machines on 1 floor (3rd). This was kind of an inconvienience when i woke up very \"dry\" after celebrating the leafs victory over the Habs. :-) When planning my next trip to T.O, I will be sure to call on the Strathcona first because of their location, value and service from their staff.

I had e-mailed the manager a month before our stay and asked if there was anything special that could be done for our stay as we are newly engaged. He responded by upgrading our room to an executive suite. That being said, I would highly recommend paying the extra money and getting an executive suite. The suite wasn't large -- probably a normal hotel room size -- but it was probably MUCH larger than the regular rooms, which I've heard are quite small. The room was clean and well appointed. What's more, the bed was surprisingly very comfortable! Think of it as an upgraded European-style hotel with smaller rooms but with more comfortable beds and very comfortable bathrooms in the rooms! Some people have complained about the individual air conditioners/heaters in the rooms, but I liked it! It was nice to be able to adjust your own heat for once! We had it just as toasty as we liked. This hotel was a great alternative to the MUCH more expensive Fairmont Royal York across the street, and if you're not planning on spending much time in your room anyways, it's perfect! We were there on vacation and were always away during the day -- doing some shopping, walking around, going to restaurants, doing tours, etc. It was just the perfect location for all of this. The convention centre is just around the corner, Union Station is extremely close, Eaton Centre is a 10 minute walk and it's not far at all from great restaurants and other shopping areas. There is also a Tim Hortons right across the street, if you're so inclined. Overall I'd recommend this hotel for its great location and the great service from the staff!! We asked for a later check-out and it was given, no problem. We also asked if they could hold our bags for us, because we had a late evening flight out of Toronto, and that was also not a problem at all. You could tell they really tried to do their best for their customers. Another great plus was we used the Airport Express from the airport and it dropped us off right in front of the Fairmont and we just walked across the street to the Strathcona. And we caught it back from the Fairmont as well -- very convenient. It was a HUGE money saver compared to a cab, and we just walked everywhere while we in the city. But if you're leaving for the airport during rush hour, be sure to alot an extra hour or so -- the driver tries his best to get you there as quickly as possible, but there's not much you can do to get past traffic on the expressway. For a nearby restaurant with reasonable prices, go to Alice Fazooli's. It's great for a dinner out in Toronto, and it won't break the bank.

It was very clean and the bed was comfortable; those are the two most important things. The free wifi was also a very big plus. On the downside: it was quite small (not a big deal for a business traveler like myself), the floor was some kind of fake hardwood (Pergo?), and while there were two \"workspaces\" (each one a tiny wooden board affixed to the wall) the only one with room for the task chair was the one without any electrical outlet nearby. In order to plug my laptop into the wall, I had to run an extension cord under a bench by the bed. The hard floor was an issue for three reasons: first, it makes the room feel more institutional and less homey; second, it's cold in Toronto in February; and third, it doesn't absorb any of the slush and water that comes in on your shoes, which means that the floor ends up not only cold and hard, but also dirty and wet. Ugh. The Strathcona's location is great; right downtown, close to several good restaurants of various kinds. I had no complaints about the service until the evening, when I went downstairs to use the \"business center\" (an extremely old, slow computer seemingly held together with duct tape). I needed to print up the PowerPoint slides for my presentation the next day. I fully expected to pay for that service, and when I asked the guy at the desk how much it would cost, he said that it would be a per-minute charge and I'd only be charged for the time I spent logged on. Not true. I was charged both for the time I spent logged on, and another 50 cents per page for the printouts. Even that wouldn't have been so bad, except that the toner cartridge was almost empty, which meant that the printouts were barely legible.

The rate was much higher than quoted with my via rail package. i wish I had gone across the street, (That hotel has a doorman, ambiance, coffee, nice guests, amenities, quoted at only 25 dollars more. I had just come from 5 days on the train. Via rail spoiled me: good food, calm service, clean sheets, clean bathrooms, nice passengers. At this hotel. my bath room was only marginally clean, the walls were crumbling under the wall paper, the service was rude, the food at the hotel was the worst I had in years. Zero ammenities. Everything was extra and under par: 10 dollars for internet service, not a single urn of coffee or hot water in site day or night. The morning breakfast option was a 16 dollar buffet of over cooked options, The salad dressing from my roomservice ceaser salad repeated for one whole day!!!! When I arrived the lobby was filled with surly young men who would not part a path for me (a tiny woman) to get to the elevator with two bags and a violin in a travel case , The lobby is cramped and uncomfortable, and not at all private. It is just a glorified glass booth right on the edge of the side walk. Only one sofa.The decorations were sparce as if they had been robbed. The hotel pub after 7 pm was an unsafe bet for a small town girl travelling alone. The front desk staff was young, unsure, indifferent, and untrained. There was no lotion, no sewing kit. I requested a sewing kit . I had to ask the staff on another floor.The microscopic one they found was no bigger than a matchbook with not enough thread to sew on two buttons. It took the staff an hour to locate one. The clothes saga: There is no laundry to self wash clothes. I checked in at 9 AM and they could not provide me with laundry services by dinner time.. or even before 11 AM the next day. Why should it take more than 26 hours to wash two pairs of slacks? Why should that cost be 19 dollars when it is neither fast or easy. They would not offer run the clothes back up to me, They called and told me they made a mistake that the clothes could not be done by the time my next train left. I had to run down three times waiting for the clothes the whole ordeal took 85 minutes. They had told me if I did not come down in 10 minutes I would not be able to get them back as it was the shift change. Summary: bad food, not so clean, bad atmosphere, indifferent service, hidden costs, everything extra, no coffee or tea, no soap or shampoos except for low quality dispensers attached to the wall with strong smelling products.total cost for one night came to over 200 dollars Canadian. Good thing: beds were comfortable. I was a little distressed at my recent Toronto experience. In general I found it rude and indifferent. Two blocks from the hotel men in expensive suits and coats smoked outside their 5 star resaturants, and high rise offices while homeless people huddled in corners or slept shoeless in minus five degree weather.

Since the floors are laminate I guess the hotel management think the maids don't have to vacuum them. I changed room during my stay because of the noise and both rooms had the same issue. The floors are dirty and full of hair. I litterally had to take a damp towel and clean the floor to get rid of all the hair. I had enough in the end to manufacture a wig. I noticed the maids don't even have a vacuum cleaner when they service the room. Fix this and also clean the doors jams of all the dirty black finger marks and you'll have a better rating next time.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ontario", "Title": "\u201cIt's fair, but beware...\u201d", "Author": "psmith45", "ReviewID": "UR62391871", "Content": "As most reviewers of this place have said, the rooms are very small, though clean for the most part.

We choose a renovated queen room- not at the suite level, but the level up from the basic renovated room. We loved the modern decorations and touches. The room was small, but certainly not the smallest we have seen, and it did have a work area. They gave us a bag with waters and snacks when we checked in, which was nice. Parking in Toronto is always a challenge and often expensive. The underground garage is so vast that you could come out blocks away from the hotel entrance, so pay attention!

The routes were easy enough, but we had a bit of trouble at first since we went into the rail station instead of the subway station. Oops. Toronto is an incredible bargain compared to NYC. This is Canada's largest city- rooms in Manhattan in a similar central location and with a similar quality would be about 3 times the price. So for some big city fun without the big city prices, give the Strathcona a try. We will use this hotel again. You can spend more money in Toronto at some of the better-known hotels or major chains, but we didn't feel the need- this is a better location than some of the chains, and we were happy with the price and value at Strathcona.

They'd act business-like & professional but what they did are not--we booked 2 nights but when checking in they say it's 1 night; we asked about parking rates for nearby garage they gave us incorrect rates; we asked for street bus pass info they again gave wrong price; and when asked about \"you offer free internet service?\" we got a \"r u kidding me\" face telling us OF COURSE you have to pay for it. Since our previous stop we stayed in a 4-star hotel with excellent staff & free/fast wireless internet & we didn't pay too much more than we paid for Strathcona, we cannot feel too good.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sudbury", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "nctrips", "ReviewID": "UR35861992", "Content": "We stayed at the Strathcona while attending a conference.

Easy access via York St. from Gardiner Expressway. Regarding the room and hotel itself, I can't think of anything negative to say given the circumstances of our trip. I (and my family) visited Toronto to see the city, not enjoy lavish hotel amenities. The room was cozy, had one double bed (more like queen-sized), was clean and well-maintained, and had a great view of York and Wellington from the 6th floor. The staff were helpful in helping us find things to do and were kind. Lastly, regarding parking... the hotel does not have a parking garage - but that's quite okay. Many downtown Toronto hotels charge anywhere from $18-32 per night based on my searches. Heading north on York, the entrance to the underground garage (lot 52; 40 York St.) is just before the front door of the hotel on the left. I just pulled into the entrance, family members unloaded, and I parked. It's true, the pedestrian entrance to the garage is about 1 block (2 is stretching it) to the hotel entrance.

The location cannot be beat - across the street from Union Station; a couple of blocks East is the financial core, Hockey Hall of Fame and the \"start\" of Younge Street; a couple of blocks West is Roy Thomson Hall, ACC, CN Tower and the theatre district; a couple of blocks North(ish) is the Eaton Centre and (a little further North from there) is the posh Bloor/Bay area. It is that central a hotel. They are in the process of updating the rooms and have stayed in both the \"old\" rooms and the \"new\" ones. The (only) difference I've noticed between the two is that the carpets have been replaced by laminate flooring. Otherwise, the rooms have been more or less identical in terms size and furnishings. (I'm sure the bathrooms were updated in an earlier phase as every \"old\" and \"new\" room I've stayed in has had the same modern-ish, simple appointments in them.) What I find too bad with the \"new\" rooms is that those little finishing details lacking in the \"old\" rooms were not fixed. With either room, it is not uncommon to find a bad patch job (or two) on the ceiling, a few scuff marks on the walls (sometimes quite large), somewhat sloppy paint jobs on the door/window trims, a few uneven wallpaper joints, etc. I realise these are all minor things, but considered together, they do (negatively) impact your impressions of the room. That being said, the bathrooms and bedding have always been spotless... and I am very picky about this. (To give you an idea, I'm the type to meticulously inspect the bathtub/toilet/sink for any stray hairs and/or dirt and always take apart the bed to check for the same (and any signs of bed bugs).) One note on the bedding, don't expect pillow-top matresses, down comforters and fluffy pillows. You get very average matresses and pillows (but still comfortable enough) and beds made up of a think polyester blanket \"wrapped\" in two flat sheets to give the bed a \"sleek\" look. The bottom line is that if you are looking for a clean, basic, ultra-convenient hotel for a very fair price, this is your place. This is not your place if you want even a hint of luxury and comfort. The times that I have stayed, I have gotten really great rates (i.e., $120 CAD per night, all taxes in) which has kept me coming back.

To be sure, this stay was the worst business hotel experience I've ever had, the world over, and that is no exaggeration by any means. They should be ashamed to operate such sub-standard facilities at incongruently over-priced rates. Most importantly to me, as a result of the substandard conditions of my so called 'executive room', I had an exceedingly poor sleep of less than six hours, all before important meetings for which I needed to be rested. For some reason, there is an emergency light power box fixed to the wall above the desk in the room. This device emits a constant green glow from a diode. That would be tolerable if it were not for the incessant and irregularly strobe like brilliantly red light that flashes from this box, all night long; over, and over, and over again, like a taunting irritant. Turns out, this box does not even need to be here! Hotel administration acknowledge it shouldn't be there and should have been installed in the outside hallway, which it serves! To bad they didn't fix this before renting the room, even though they acknowledge it as one of the many problems with the room. Coupled with this, however, was the constant and grossly disruptive street, hall and adjoining room noise which passed through the door, windows and walls as if they were paper. Indeed, though I was on the ninth floor, the street noise was incomprehensibly loud. Through the room door, which is immediately across from the stairwell door, which I can attest is frequently used, came the constant noise of people opening and closing the stairwell door, which slams shut very loudly, reverberating disruptive noise through the room. Listening to the showers of adjoining room occupants above and adjacent to this room was less than appealing too. Not being able to rest fitfully, I got up to work in the night. Perhaps not surprisingly, the light over the desk would not work, and the desk lamp was inadequate for laptop working. The TV was an antiquated relic and the signal very poor at best. The bathroom was shameful, with a sink right out of the Don Jail, a lovely patch on the ceiling and patches on the walls, and the shower head falling from the wall. The size of the entire room was not much larger than a walk-in closet. All in all, and needless to say, it was less than a restful or pleasant stay. One would think the high speed wireless internet would be available with the room as a courtesy, but instead was evidently only available for fee. Rather than incurring what was likely a disproportionate expense, given my experience with the room, I passed on this service so can't comment. To be sure, the room price was very disproportionate to the quality, or lack thereof, of the room in general. I was exceedingly disappointed, and tired after my stay. The host's response was one of surprise in that she noted I was in an 'executive room'. I agree with her that the experience does not comport with the standards of an executive room. But when she suggested I should have called to change rooms, my only response is that their rooms should all meet a minimum standard, and if this room, being bad as it was, was permitted to exist in this condition, then my concern was 'how bad might the next room be?' As a courtesy, these concerns were brought to the hotel administrations' attention, and they concede a number of concerns existed without their knowledge (why wouldn't they inspect the room before charging such high rates?! They could have addressed the problems in advance, but didn't.), and in respect of other concerns, they're currently renovating to address those (then why continue to rent the pre-renovated rooms at such high rates!!, or why not put customers in the renovated rooms!!). To me, their response of acknowledging the substandard conditions, but offering only a future free night's stay in a room which should have been given in the first place. One would think a refund of some small measure would be more appropriate. I won't go back, and take this time to share my experience so no one else falls into the same trap I did, of thinking 'you get what you pay for' and the high price reflected quality; it did not.", "Date": "September 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoney Creek Ontario", "Title": "\u201cAlwlays A Charmer!\u201d", "Author": "StCreek", "ReviewID": "UR19504015", "Content": "Location, Location, Location!

The second room was a little larger, but was still deemed to be too small for a cot by the hotel staff.

The cot fit in there, but just barely and it blocked the bathroom door and the tv (which incidentally was in the closet).

I've never run into a problem like this before, and while the service staff were attempting to be accommodating, they were far from understanding. We had to get a taxi to a different hotel, and then argue with the staff at the different hotel about what accommodation we'd be getting. We had a number of items with us, that we didn't want to have to lug around Toronto. This is one of the reasons we actually booked a hotel for three days, and didn't choose to move from hotel to hotel.

The Airport Express bus pickup site is just across the street. In addition, access to the subway is also quite close. There are several international ATM machines in close proximity of the hotel, including a HSBC terminal just on the next corner. Location was perhaps the best feature of the hotel. The rooms were relatively small and cramped. Because the desk was in a small alcove it was difficult to actually pull out the desk chair and use the desk. The closet space was also a bit smaller than normal. Nevertheless, the room was clean and the bed very comfortable. The shower was satisfactory even though a bit slippery when entering or leaving the ceramic tub. There is a restaurant/pub on the lower level called \"The Pub\" but strangely enough was closed early Saturday evening even though the hours posted indicated it should have been open. I did not use the restaurant service breakfast, preferring to have and espresso coffee at one of several places closeby. The staff were friendly and did make a couple of good recommendations for a restaurant when I checked in late. Checkout was easy and quite efficient. However, I am concerned about a possible double billing on my credit card but I expect that this will be resolved in a day or two without my intervention. It is just that the credit card website showed two separate (but different) charges to my account about 30 hours after I checked out. Don't expect picture perfect views from your window. My own room looked out at the side of another plain building next door. If I looked far to the right, I could see the Airport Express bus stop and the far side of the Fairmont Royal York Hotel.

I was on my own and don't really care about the room as long as I have a place to leave my stuff, sleep comfortably and clean up. So no real complaints there. The location is incredible. 5-10 minute walk to anywhere I wanted to go. CN Tower, Theatre/night club district, Hockey Hall of Fame, spectacular harbour area.

Some tips: Airport shuttle bus drops off across the street. Tim Horton's is also across the street - a perfect place for a cheap and inexpensive breakfast to start your day. The reason I only give this place 2 out of 5 stars is the service was horrible. The gentleman who checked me could not have been any less interested in his job. It was a terrible first impression of the place. I thought maybe he was having a bad day, but the next night he was exactly the same. Other counter staff seemed friendlier, but I always got stuck with that guy. Cleaning staff wasn't great either. Fresh towels were always supplied, but bed was never made, soaps and shampoos never restocked. Personally I don't really care about that, but it's sort of expected for $120 a night I was spending. Lastly the concierge desk was a joke. Completely unknowledgeable. I wasn't asking for anything grand, just for some directions and inquiring about theatre tickets. Gentleman there didn't have any idea, but that's fine, I figured it out on my own. Bottom line, this place doesn't get the greatest review because of service. The room was really small too. While the location was phenomenal, now that I know the city better, I will stay further away from the downtown core but at a hotel close to the subway.

The best thing though has to be the location. It is no more than 10 minutes walk from any of the main attractions. CN tower, skydome, Air Canada centre, Eaton Place, HarbourFront etc. The airport shuttle bus even stops just accross the road. We only had a standard room and it was on the small side but it was clean and tidy and we didn't spend that much time in it anyway. The breakfast/lunch cafe attached is excellant and the pub/sports bar underneath is also good but as we didn't actually eat there I can't comment on the food. However you are spoilt for choice for good cheap eating places in Toronto. If I was going to Toronto again or if I knew of anyone going I would recommend the Strathcona as a base for the trip. One thing to be aware of though is that their are roadworks going on just down the road from the hotel which can get noisy but no nosier than loud traffic and isn't all day this doesn't just affect this hotel though.", "Date": "May 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buffalo, NY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1762381", "Content": "My friend and I stayed 1 night at this hotel. We were going to a concert and found the location to the Air Canada Center extemely close-5 min walk. It is also just a few mins walk to the Union Subway station. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. There is no parking available at the hotel itself, however, the staff recommends a more reasonable lot around the corner. It is a short 2 blocks from the hotel, about a 5 min walk. ($13 for 24 hours) Or you could always park directly next door in the ramp, which we were advised is much more expensive. We had the larger room, 2 queen beds, which I think is about the size of a regular hotel room. The room was clean!! The only bad thing I can say was the towels had a funky smell.

This room was small, actually very small (borderline puny), the bed was poor quality and also small (a double rather than a queen or king), there was absolutely no view (this wasnt a big priority for me personally), parking was two long city blocks away (no valet, no on-site self park. This was nothing even close to what Priceline lists as three star comparable such as Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Embassy Suites, or Sheraton. The door was not snug against the floor and I could hear conversations in the room across the hall without straining to listen, there was writing on the wall of the room, there was minimal table, counter, vanity, and dresser space. The staff was helpful and the location were good. But this is a 2 and 1/2 star hotel AT BEST. I hope it is not the policy of Priceline to let 3 Star Hotels assign inferior rooms to Priceline users.
