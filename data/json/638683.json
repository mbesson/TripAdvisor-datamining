It is situated in a busy area of Madrid, cloe to the Bernabeu football stadium. The hotel has its own car park which for us was a big bonus as we drove to Madrid. Check in was quick and easy even though we arrived late at night. Our rooms were spotlessy clean and modern with large comfortable beds. We had a family room and a double room and both were of the same standard. BotH rooms were of a decent size for a city hotel. Bathrooms were equipped with a great shower and the usual facilities. Again, spotlessly clean. The temperature of the air con is controlled by reception but is put to the temperature of your choice on request. It can be switched on and off in the room. Breakfast was buffet style served in a room in the hotel - we did find it very warm in there but opened a window !!!! Only downside to the hotel is the lack of public bar to sit and have a drink after a long day shopping and sightseeing around Madrid but there are bars locally. Would return to this hotel and would definitely stay again.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Luton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cshould be rated 4 star,amazing value for money\u201d", "Author": "estelle1968", "ReviewID": "UR114782064", "Content": "What a great hotel.We went to Madrid to visit family so just wanted a basic hotel in a good location and what a surprise we got when we got there.The hotel was spotless with extremely helpfull and friendly staff,our room was tastefully decorated with working AC,a comfortable bed and a great shower.It has 2 lifts so no walking up stairs,is in a great location just seconds from the Metro and surrounded by great shops and bars.We were so impressed that we would not hesitate to stay here again and as my brother and sister in law live 10 minutes from this hotel I will be back.The only downside was the lack of a bar in the hotel and an outside seating area but as there were bars and restuarants located within yards of the hotel it wasn't an issue.Highly recommend this hotel to anyone.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Richard72", "ReviewID": "UR18318658", "Content": "I've stayed in this hotel many times over the course of several business trips to Madrid. Without exception this is one of the best hotels I have stayed in, in Madrid, at this price level. The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable, and most of all it is quiet at night. The staff are very friendly and breakfast is included (although it may be a little basic if you are looking for a big selection).
