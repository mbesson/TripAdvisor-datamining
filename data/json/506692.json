Like stated in many other reviews, it is a 3star hotel and it could probably use some updates in the furnishings and food choices, but that is all.

We went to sleep immediatly only to be woken up again at around 8.am. when some of the staff tried to open the door and found the security lock. Breakfast is ok, nothing out of this world but I wasn't expecting big things. Taxis don't know this hotel. We went out and returned at around 7 p.m. only to see that our room wasn't serviced so I phoned them and soon after someone came to give us at least clean towels. they kept our passport for the whole 2 days.

We had a two-nights stopover in Dubai and our main objective was to visit Burj Dubai/Khalifa observation deck \u2013 and we were lucky enough to get there. Back to the review: on the plus side the room was very spacious and clean. There were quite loud party vibes in the street when we arrived late night Thursday, but the windows in our room were soundproof. On the other hand the room looked very 1970s and the hotel was packed with noisy Russians. Swimming pool and sundeck terrace on the rooftop was quite small and not really welcoming. Mediocre breakfast (selection-, taste- and service-wise) and indifferent staff did not improve our impression. They asked our passports on arrival to keep them overnight for a police check but were reluctant to give us any proof that they took the passports. Eventually, they did, because we insisted. On the second day it was a real pain to get our passports back \u2013 we had to ask for it 3 times - different times of the day- until we got them back. The area is also not really special, but taxis are cheap in Dubai and we also made a 5-10 minutes walk from to Dhow Wharfage and the Dubai Creek. From there it is about 20 min of nice walk along the water to the abra (watertaxi) stations. Next time in Dubai I will look for a different place to stay.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Praha", "Title": "\u201cgood position\u201d", "Author": "vk68", "ReviewID": "UR52305231", "Content": "in this hotel we're stayed on return road from Maldives.

Breakfast was 3 stars like expected. Free continental breakfast with eggs, beans, toast, crossiants, potatos, sausage, etc. You can order omelettes and they'll cook one up for you right away. Only issue I had with the hotel was that it's not near anything spectacular since it's located in Old Dubai. You can walk to the Gold and Spice souk, but other than that, the rest of the attractions are in new Dubai, so you pay about 20 AED to take a Cab into New Dubai where everything's happening.", "Date": "June 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oklahoma / Iraq", "Title": "\u201cI always stay at the Lords\u201d", "Author": "DnK_G", "ReviewID": "UR20441715", "Content": "When traveling through Dubai I always stay at the Lords.

Breakfast consists of Toast and beans, cereals, fruits, deli meats, cheeses, scramble or fried eggs, potatoes and so on. Rooms are spacious and clean, nothing fancy.

It is only a 2.5 star max. The location is in old Dubai which features very few of teh post card spots that you want to visit in Dubai. This is a run down part of town that is very noisy especially at night as there seems to be a fashion of every driver in town beeping their horn even late at night. The hotel is also run down and stinks of stale tobacco. It is full of oafish and surly Russians and it is definatly true that they get prefered service by the staff. The food is rubbish, and if you are compelled to stay here you simply must eat away from here. The Breakfast is very limited and was cold every morning we ate here. The pool is ugly - just don't bother. English is not understood here and we simply gave up after a while - we even had to take it upon ourselves to hail cabs. All in all this was a poor experience and poorly reflected Dubai and its luxurious excesses. I would absolutely recommend that if you are going to Dubai then pay more and go for something close to Jemeriah beach (where all of the action is). The only things worth seeing in old Dubai are the Gold markets and teh museum - this can be done in 3-4 hours. Tip - best restaurant in Town is Meat Co.

The rooms are very large, if they are empty try for a corner room where you really get a lot of space, The roof top pool is small but refreshing and usefull if you just want to catch a few rays without visiting the beach. Be aware once you put on suntan lotion though they dont like you going back in the water! The staff throughout the hotel are friendly and internet access is availble in reception .. free for first few minutes if you just want a quick check otherwise nominal fee for an hour. Must have missed all the Russians, seen a few Indian families though. If you are a businessman and want a city hotel just as abase I highly recommend it.. for families treat it as a usefull stopover place its not a hotel I would spend a week on a family holiday.

Reception staff seem to give precedence to their Russian guests, as this is a predominantly Russian hotel. I found russian fellow-guests rather cold and unfriendly, they insisted on staring at us at the Breakfast table and always pushed in at reception, using their language to their advantage. In terms of security and cleanliness, I must give this hotel 10/10. There is a safety deposit box at reception, which is reliable for storing cash and passports. Breakfast was basic but ok. You get a free shuttle service to Jumeirah beach and back - which is a boon. Hotel was very awkward and unhelpful whenit came to assisting with wife's visa. They showed very little interest in helping out with that side, despite already having had a booking fully paid for. I would prefer to try somewhere else next time, but would not discourage future visitors to Dubai from staying here.
