We (late 30s couple, used to traveling) chose this hotel because it was slightly cheaper than others in the area at the time I booked. I knew we'd made a mistake when we turned up! The reception area was small, chaotic and unwelcoming. The guy checking us in wanted our 3 nights' fee up front (before we had seen the room) and because we were early we needed to leave our bags there but had no choice but to leave them in the open \"reception\" area. When we finally saw our room I wanted to run away! Tiny attic room at the top, broken window catch so we couldn't close it or open it properly (in winter), tiny, lumpy bed crammed into an awkward corner, sheets smaller than the mattress, nasty white stains on spare blanket (!), hair all over the carpet, cigarette butts in the gutter by the window, on a main road so incredibly noisy. Maybe we got the worst room - but it was just depressing. Not helped by the noisy (very dodgy) group of men staying in the room next to ours. Bathroom was tiny but clean. Should have slept in there.... We checked out the next morning, were given back just one night's fee of the 3 we'd paid, and found a lovely 4 star Last Minute place around the corner for the same price!

It's four stars for me or nothing at all. But when I needed a bolt-hole for two nights while I waited between flights at London Heathrow, I reluctantly checked into the Metro Hotel. I expected, for \u00a340 per night, it to be a backpackers hovel, an unclean, cess-pit where I'd spend sleepless nights listening to Polish gangsters carving up a prostitutes body in the room next door. Instead, I was absolutely charmed by the whole place. And while I expected to be bringing my own black light to any joint in Zone 1 of London for that price, the room was.....nice. Clean. With a nice turned down bed. A sink. I opened the french windows and there was a small balcony overlooking a charming stretch of West London street- I watched the black taxis zoom past, in the pouring rain, quietly falling in love with the city I left over a year ago- a city I grew up in. Was it melancholy speaking? I started to love this hotel. How else can you get a key to your own front door in central London for that place. I've paid more in rent for worse flat shares. The staff were friendly guys. The breakfast was delivered to my door, and included in the price. No prostitutes were murdered during my entire stay. And I actually missed the place when I checked out. I mean, you couldn't bring a girl back here, if you met one in, perhaps one of the nice bars nearby. She might be horrified at the communal bathroom. But if like me you need a small room to pass the 46 hour wait for a plane....Ask for room two. Nice room.

Let me start by saying that the location is great, Only 5 minutes away from London Paddington, a very safe area for any experience travellers or first timers in London. London paddington connects you to any cross-country train and since I was coming from Wales this was perfect for me. Paddington also connects you with the tube [Bakerloo line] (subway system in London), and that will take you anywhere in London zone 1 though 6. The overall cleanness of the room and bathroom was very good. The rooms are small but quite sufficient for the basic needs. If you are planning to spend a lot of time in your room (which I wouldn't imaging the reason), you might as well try a different hotel with more spacious rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful, so not complaints at all. My departure plans were at 4:30am, so the night before one of the members of staff brought me breakfast which i thought it was very nice of him.The breakfast was highly appreciated specially by an empty stomach in the early morning. (a juice box, crackers, sweet bread filled with chocolate, a bread roll, butter, jam, and a yogurt) There is a Television set in the room and a small refrigerator which comes very handy when you want to keep snack and cold water. This hotel doesn't have a lift, so if your room is on the top floor, you are going to be exhausted by the time you reach it. specially if you are bringing heavy suitcases with you. The Wi-Fi is non-existent on the top floors and in the lobby my computer couldn't connect to the router, so that was a complete failure.

We had wi-fi connection but it is not free: you have to pay BT for this. The procedure is pretty simple and payment is quick, so if you really want internet connection in your room you can have it at decent fares (5 days for 15\u00c2\u00a3 or something like this) The hotel is very quiet: if you're looking for noisy hostels full of guys everywhere with smoky common rooms...ok, this is the wrong place. It's more like a real hotel, where you can actually sleep if you want. They bring you breakfast in your room every morning: that's soooo cool! You won't have hand-baked croissants or organic orange juice but trust me: there's a lot of choice and the breakfast you'll receive is VERY rich. The room is cleaned up everyday, and the staff is very friendly. The location is great too: you are 50 meters from the Paddington station, where you can take both the underground and the railway.

The hotel is basic, but it never pretends to be anything more than a budget option and for us it was exactly what we needed - a cheap and convenient place to stay after a night out in central London. The location is excellent, barely a minute's walk from Paddington station, and it was convienience and price that attracted us to book here. First impressions were a little off-putting - a narrow staircase up to a tiny reception area that was crowded with luggage and piles of towels - and the place does look a little rough around the edges, but our room was clean and tidy and we were pleasantly surprised by how nice the bathroom was. The room was definitely very small - the bed was right up against the window on the one side and only a yard from the wall on the other, so we only had a little bit of space at the foot of the bed and outside the bathroom where we could put our bags. We also had a small bedside table, a wardrobe with a safe inside, a mini-fridge, tea and coffee making facilities, a TV that made an annoying buzzing sound when it was turned on and a broken chair! I definitely wouldn't recommend the place to travellers staying longer than one or two nights or planning to spend some time relaxing in the room, but all we wanted was a place to leave our bags, change to go out and sleep when we came back in, and for that it was fine. The mattress and pillows were comfy and we had a good night's sleep, although perhaps light sleepers might not fare so well as the road outside was pretty busy and you can hear passing trains from time to time. In the morning we were given a breakfast tray (which can be brought to you any time between 8am and 10am) - it was a simple collection of pre-packed items (yoghurt, juice, bread, mini-croissants and biscuits) but was nice enough and saved us having to go out and buy something. At check out we were able to leave bags free of charge to collect later, which was really helpful - although they were just left in the corridor by reception so I wouldn't recommend this for valuables. All in all, I'd recommend this place to any travellers on a budget who just want somewhere to crash for a couple of nights, but if you're looking for a longer stay or hoping to spend some time relaxing in your hotel room then I think the small size of the rooms would really annoy you and it's probably worth spending a bit more for a nicer, more spacious room elsewhere. And it's definitely a good option for young people on a night out in central London - it was really easy to get in to Soho on the tube and back on the night bus, and the room keys allow you to let yourself in to the hotel 24/7.", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Australia", "Title": "\u201cdon't stay here\u201d", "Author": "bintravln", "ReviewID": "UR81745327", "Content": "dramatic, but wish someone had listed this before we booked. there are definitely better places around for not too much more, the stairs are killers, the guy at desk is nice and all but the room is barely bigger than a wardrobe and the \"double\" we booked was a large single at best. clean ensuite but the bedroom absolutely not suitable for 2 adults to stay in, great location but there's heaps of other little hotels in the area.", "Date": "October 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Poland", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel close to center and transportation\u201d", "Author": "sypa", "ReviewID": "UR80793429", "Content": "Nice, cheap, quite clean.
