{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Lakeview Hotel - rather average We stayed one night in the Lakeview hotel.The bedrooms and toilet were basic - just about clean enough.The food is rather poor, but at the time (late Nov) of our visit very few alternatives were open, and those that were open were genuinely dirty. The price is too high for what you get, but nowhere else in Penelokan was open - if we had known there was alternative accommodation down in the crater, we would have tried there instead.The view from the rooms is, as suggested by others, very good indeed. And from the exterior, the hotel is quite attractive - I doubt there is anywhere better in Penelokan.The hotel charges in US dollars, which I think is a cheek.I'm rating this hotel as overall average. That is average for out-of-season undeveloped tourist-traps in Indonesia, which equates to very poor elsewhere - had this hotel been in Kuta it would get a lower rating. And if it were not for the fact that in the days preceeding our visit we had stayed in some genuinely poor places elsewhere, I expect I would rate it lower.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR377615616", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AGSV"}, {"Content": "Amazing views, illness inducing food We booked 2 nights at this hotel as it was recommended in the Bali/Lombok Rough Guide. As we were led to expect, the hotel itself was fairly basic, ugly from the outside, not the cleanest although the rooms were attractive and OK in size. Don't be fooled by the picture of a swimming pool on their website - there is none here. Admittedly, the reviews were right in that it's position high on the sides of the caldera with panoramic views of the crater lake and Mt Batur was inspiring. Each room had a glass wall and balcony overlooking this view - lucky really becuase that was all we got to see of Mt Batur...........we ate a generous but nothing special buffet lunch in the restaurant when we arrived. Later on, we tried to find somewhere else to eat dinner but found everything nearby shuts up shop at 5pm so we duly traipsed back to the hotel for another very average meal. At 1:30am, I woke up and spent the next 12 hours vomiting every 45 minutes.......food poisening! Was too ill to leave the hotel for our whole stay and due to the lack of other nearby options, my husband was forced to eat there again....and again. His stomach luckily lasted out until we arrived at our next hotel, whereby he immediately came down with bad food poisening too - most likely from the Lakeview breakfast. We felt ill for about a week. When I, very politely, mentioned my sickness to the hotel staff they were unsympathetic, uninterested and unapologetic. The service in general was fairly poor, maybe because the hotel caters mainly to fleeting one-off visitors. I do not recommend anyone stay here - better to stay down at the base of Mt Batur. Also worth mentioning is that the volcano peak was always shrouded in cloud at sunrise making a trek at that time of day potentially fruitless. It was usually clear by the lunchtime.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR925887225", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Alicia55"}, {"Content": "Rip off!  This hotel is way to expensive for what you get. There is no pool here (you have to get a ride down to the lake where you can bathe in the hot spring.. cost 100,000 Rupia) - RIP OFFThe Satalite TV is a joke. You have to call the front desk to change the channel for you since all the TV Boxes are located there.The food was the worst yet in Bali and we've been here for 2 weeks. How can you not make toast properly? why must it consistantly taste like cardboard? And the lunch buffet is all cold and tastes like cardboard too. not worth 10USD for lunch at all. We ended up walking down the hill in the rain to eat elsewhere.They have people in the driveway there that harass you to buy things and take tours. For 35-50USD/night this should not be allowed!The rooms also have a little bit of a mold smell to them too.THe only good thing here is the view.

The time my wife and I spent in this hotel is simply the worst in our life !Location : perfect for the wonderful views on Gunug Batur and its lake. But for eating, no choice, everything around is simply dead after 5 pm.Restaurant : extremely dirty. We did eat there twice, having no choice (we climbed Batur at night, so had to be in shape). It is fatty, and as you see people cooking, you understand soon that you will be sick 1 hour later. Which we both were...Hotel : two levels of room. If you choose the superior level, you expect to have some kind of premium towards standard offer. This is false; superior = worst rooms. Walls are paper thin; we could hear people whispering in both neighbour rooms.Bed was extremely dirty. We had to put clothes on the pillow to lay our face on it, and stayed with clothes on in the night.Bathroom : toilets and bathroom are the same thing. Just follow the smell.I have to say that we are young but experiences travellers; we do not expect very high comfort in rural and isolated areas, but in this case, minimum survival needs were not satisfied.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR728237570", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Epigone"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1025506-d309158-r11519837-Lakeview_Hotel_and_Restaurant-Bangli_Bali.html", "HotelID": "309158", "Price": "$60"}}
