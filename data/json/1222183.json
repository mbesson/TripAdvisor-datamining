The neighborhood isnt exactly picturesque with a cemetery and some old NY houses. But it's safe! Extremely safe! There is a starbucks and some fast food chains cose by , an old style 'market' with fruitselllers and internet cafes not so far off. The breakfast is average , not out of the world but not bad either Good bang for our buck!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati, Ohio", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for, plus a little.\u201d", "Author": "braumeister", "ReviewID": "UR121029575", "Content": "A fairly quiet backwater part of town, and a slightly rundown but pretty clean hotel.

Service seemed cold when I arrived early (busy day maybe?), but improved tremendously after lunch when I was allowed to check in early and got a room change to a twin double room which I had requested. The front desk was friendly and one can get free cookies too (late afternoon). The room itself was comfy, and well stocked with the amenities one would expect. The breakfast was nothing special, ending a tad early (6am-9am) so do not sleep in if you want catch it. My friend who had a more selective tastebud did not see anything he liked. Maybe due to feedback or cost, they have changed the shuttle service to a taxi service, and each room only gets to use it once a day. So one must always walk one trip between the metro. While it is a 15min walk, i do not recommend people to stay out too late due to the quiet streets that one has to walk through between the hotel and the station, Certainly do not recommend for people with families or young ones or even single female travelers. While the area is not an touristy spot, it has a nice charm and overlook a quiet and beautiful cemetery. The architecture of the hotel itself is also quite interesting.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Berlin, Germany", "Title": "\u201cok, great view though!\u201d", "Author": "ilovenyc77", "ReviewID": "UR72235040", "Content": "had to book it on short notice, was the only affordable place for those dates. located in queens, metro station can be reached walking about 15 minutes, from there's a train directly to time square, so it was pretty easy to get into the city. the area is pretty uninteressting except for this very, very huge old cemetary across the street which is great to take beautiful pictures as it has thousounds of statues and old tombstones. if you don't have a room facing manhattan you can get into the staircase and can take great photos of manhattan skyline. the hotel is relatively clean even though the interior and furniture are quite old. breakfast is good. there's a free shuttle to laguardia airport and to the metro station if you don't want to carry your luggage all the way. the driver was a very nice and funny guy ;) not my favourite place but if you don't expect too much, it's a good place.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAn excellent stay\u201d", "Author": "ekaltenthaler", "ReviewID": "UR63656297", "Content": "We were stranded in New York during the recent volcanic ash fiasco and ended up in the City View Inn. We were a party of 7 in two rooms for one week. What could have been a very unpleasant stay turned out to be much more pleasant mostly due to the treatment we received at the City View Inn. The rooms were immaculate and the women who cleaned them were very accomodating. The front desk staff were also extremely helpful. Although this hotel is a little way from the center of New York, it is only a fifteen minute walk to the subway and the hotel provides free transport. Also a fifteen minute walk away were some really interesting restaurants.

Now the hotel has no van, got rid of the drivers while we were there and try to make you walk to the metro (takes 30 minutes) and denies you service to the Airport even though it's still included in the Best Western Hotels website. Guests had to keep asking for the manager to be taken to the metro station or back to the Airport. The manager didn't want to show his face due to the lack of service.. It's a pity since the hotel has very attentive corteous employees and to no fault of their own the impression of the hotel is lacking. Had to tell by phone to the manager that I was an old client since they didn't want to honor the website offer of travel back to the Airport. This is not the way to spend a vacation. Therefore beware. If you want to go anyway to his hotel anyway be prepared to argue and get mad as I saw several other guests doing. I heard it in English, French and German. Everyday was an adventure since you didn't know if they would order a taxi for you or if you had to walk. I had to walk four days out of six days. Beware also that if you get a taxi ordered by the hotel you have to tell them to include your bags, because otherwise you end up arguing with the taxi drivers that when you travel you do have suitcases, since the taxi driver told us the coupon just covered persons. Not a way to end a vacation travel. As soon as I arrived home I checked the website of the hotel, and they still offer transportation from and to the La Guardia Airport which you have to argue to get and transportation to and from the Metro station which they didn't give me four times out of six. Maybe if you take the fact sheet printout of the hotel you have better luck than I did. Good luck with it, because the justification for the lack of service was that they had cheaper rates.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN City View Inn Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60763-d1222183-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_City_View_Inn_Hotel-New_York_City_New_York.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">3317 Greenpoint Avenue</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">New York City</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">NY</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">11101 </span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1222183", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/d9/bd/41/best-western-city-view.jpg"}}
