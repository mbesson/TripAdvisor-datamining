The rooms are comfortable and spacious, I had a Executive Suite, and it was a treat to come home to after a long day at the stadium. The staff from the front desk to the breakfast crew are very helpful and a pleasure to deal with. Adam at the front desk and Mother Theresa at the breakfast room in the morning are a plus for this hotel. Good access on and off the highway into the city and plenty of food options nearby. I would definitely recommend on the staff alone!!", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ontario", "Title": "\u201cAnother great stay - Clean and comfy!\u201d", "Author": "3girlsandaguy", "ReviewID": "UR124348363", "Content": "We recently stayed here for my daughter's cheerleading competition. I wanted to avoid staying downtown and it's higher prices/business/costly parking. This was perfect! Great location, lots of food nearby, 10 minutes to downtown. The rooms were clean, large and very nicely decorated-very modern. The hotel looks new.Microwave and fridge were very convenient. Good breakfast selection, make your own pancakes (not waffles), cereal, yogurt, baked goods (muffins bagels etc) toast, orange/apple juice, fruit and also they had hot offerings such as scrambled eggs/biscuits gravy/sausage I think it changes daily. Internet/business centre in lobby. The pool is small-average, neat shape my kids liked it. The room itself is kind of chilly but my kids didn't mind they said the water was great. No hot tub. The pool area was clean. It says pool closes at 10 pm but it is not enforced. Work out area with modern equipment. I truly enjoyed staying here. The staff was courteous. No complaints. Bob Evans across the parking lot. Great stay, we will be sure to book here again when we are in the area!", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Haven, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay\u201d", "Author": "erperp", "ReviewID": "UR120430701", "Content": "Safe neighborhood.

The room was very nice and the layout was different from your average cookie-cutter hotel room. There was a large dressing area and a tiny kitchenette. The bathroom was small, but nicely appointed. Our room was very quiet, due to the layout. The dressing area and bathroom shielded the room from any hallway noise. Also, we were on the front of the hotel, not the back toward the busy highway. The internet connection was strong and dependable. That is one of the most important things for me. Just be sure to get the username and password at the front desk. I neglected to ask and wasn't told that it was required. However, a quick phone call down to the front desk solved the problem easily. The beds and pillows were comfortable. Furniture looked new. Interesting headboards with brushed metal stripes. The AC was efficient. Electrical outlets were plentiful and out in the open. Free USA Today. My only complaint was that I could not get an ABC station on the TV. Check-in and check-out was friendly and efficient. I was only in Indianapolis for one night of a seven night road trip, but I found myself wishing I could stay longer in this comfortable hotel.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "ecto1", "ReviewID": "UR106092927", "Content": "Stopped here for one night on a road trip. Conveniently located off I-70 and I-465. I've seen other reviewers complain about traffic noise, but I didn't encounter any problems on the side of the hotel that doesn't face the interstate. Great beds and pillowcases with stitching identifying them as \"firm\" and \"soft\". Such a simple touch that goes a long way. Kudos to Adam at the front desk! From the moment we pulled up to the moment we had the keys for 3 rooms (along with complimentary bottled water and peanuts), I don't think 4 minutes elapsed. Most efficient hotel check-in ever! (Join Priority Club, people. It's worth it.) Adam was pleasant and knew the area surrounding the hotel, which is always welcome when you need to find a store in an unfamiliar city. Microwave, refrigerator, and snack counter w/sink in our room featuring two queen sized beds. Free wi-fi and great complimentary breakfast in the morning featuring cheese omelettes, biscuits and gravy, bacon, fruit, cinnamon rolls, coffee, tea, juice, milk, etc. Everything you need to get back on the road in the morning. Teresa (food prep) was a joy to talk to and kept the area clean and ready for more guests. (Should you happen to sleep in and miss the 9:30am cut-off for the complimentary breakfast, Bob Evans is across the street and an equally good experience for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.) It's people like Adam and Teresa that making being away from home feel like home. They are the finest examples of what every hotel should look for in staffing.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice but too noisey!\u201d", "Author": "VFloyd", "ReviewID": "UR104446779", "Content": "The overall cleanliness of the room was excellent, but when arriving in Indianapolis at 2am after a 9hour drive I could NOT get to sleep with all the noise outside the room.

I could hear upstairs running or just othr random noises that seemed to be coming from all angels of my room (below,above,right,left).. I'm usually a sleep anytime, anywhere type person but not this weekend.. I ended up sleeping with the tv & a fan running just to drain out the noise (with more noise) lol If it weren't for all of this, I would definitely stay here again.. Good distance to downtown & major highways, very clean hotel (small bathroom) but nice size room for just 2 people.

It was very large with a sofa, coffee table and writing desk along with a microwave and mini fridge under a small bar/table attached to the wall. The bed was very comfortable as well!
