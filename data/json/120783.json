After using a website to book our room and receiving a confirmation number, we arrived at the hotel to find that we had no reservation. My confirmation number didn't matter because I booked through a third party website. After scrambling for several minutes, she found a room that was being held for someone who had not arrived yet. We paid online for a deluxe floor king room. I was told that this room was not available but if I contacted the website I booked through I could get a refund for the difference. Running late to my event at this point I agreed. As she was typing my info in to the computer several people came down complaining that their keys didn't work. Which seems to be a common complaint about this hotel. I then arrived in my room to find a bathroom the size of a closet, and decorated like I was on a submarine. The trim had been stripped from all of the doors and hallways. And there was one tiny mirror in the bathroom. One vending machine in the entire hotel, which was sold out of everything. Very disappointing, especially for the money spent. Next day, I contact the third party website to attempt to get my refund, they call the hotel to verify my story. And I am told that the hotel says they billed the third party website for the entire amount, with no discount. What??? So I call the hotel. \"Oh we are sorry. We will tell them the situation.\" Never again will I stay at the hotel.

I understand some of the negative reviews, particularly had they been booked into the rooms not yet remodeled/updated. Last summer (July 2008), I booked two nights for 14 guests from my company who were coming to town from all across the country. The weather during our three day stay in Indy (my home town) was simply gorgeous, so we had THAT going for us. All of the guests were pleasantly surprised by the main lobby experience - it's a grand ol' dark wood and colored glass affair with very large windows looking out onto The Circle (although the main desk is a cramped affair also handling club health facility registration, minor vending functions, and more). The main stairs are marble and wood, and the elevators have the old world feel to them, but are relatively modern (read: quick and steady). Should you book this hotel (and I had been forewarned), make sure to request the remodeled rooms - mostly directly on the Circle - although SOME of the rooms on the Circle have NOT been remodeled, so don't just asks for rooms on the Circle, ask for recently remodeled rooms). The remodeled rooms, to our experience, were very comfortable, large, and spotless. They were not at all ultra-luxurious as you'd find in the Conrad or a Four Seasons hotel, but they had upscale bed linens and bath towels, and were consistent with the amenities/furnishings of a 4 star hotel. All guests reported being highly pleased with not only the rooms, but the service received in the hotel. It's hard to disprove a negative (the tales related by one of the earlier reviewers (e.g. the \"hispanic cleaning lady\" and her non-hygenic ways, or the rather snooty take on the alleged desperation of a private club and their non-health-concious menu). So I won't try. I'll say with enthusiasm that these types of thing were not at all our experience and reflect a characterization of quality-of-service that is quite the opposite of ours. The relatively small, but high quality/\"Mad Men\" like bar was a GREAT place for our group to gather over a few drinks before heading out of an evening for dinner (we did not eat in the club - although I've eaten there before and the food was very good, not the best food experience in Indy but WAY far from a poor quality experience). They ARE light on the grass-clipping type of nutritional fare preferred by some; this is afterall Indianapolis's bastion of Republican business hob-nobbing (I'm NOT a Republican, but the menu reflects stereotypical meat 'n potatoes, or salmon 'n potatoes, Republican tastes). Both dining areas are great places to eat - the Crystal Room is a large, open room with linen tablecloths, marble floors, very high ceilings with rich wood trim, and large windows out onto the Circle - the main dining room downstairs is more the old \"hunt club\" type of experience, with a bit more modern take than \"hunt club\" would imply. It's the more intimate of the two rooms, and where dinner is held (the upstairs Crystal Room is primarily for business lunches, where high-visibility business contacts are made and renewed ... I recommend The Columbia Club heartily to anyone looking for a uniquely Indianapolis hotel experience, and one right on The Circle. Circling back to my intro, it was absolutely stunning for us to walk out of the hotel onto The Circle, with the huge waterfalls and open, brick covered pedestrian mall feel of the monument area. Our guests loved it, thankful for a change from the normal, but also quite wonderful, corporate chain hotel experiences we normally book (W, Marriott, Hilton or Conrad, etc.).", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fort Wayne, IN", "Title": "\u201cColumbia Club--interesting\u201d", "Author": "MHCFortWayne_IN", "ReviewID": "UR24642708", "Content": "The Columbia Club was a private club, members only, but has gone public.

The staff at the front desk were the only enjoyable thing there. The building itself is suposed to have this historic feel and vibe. It fails badly! The rooms need to be updated so bad. They look like cheap rooms from the late 80's. The room service took a long time and was awfull. Food was not good!!! I will not go back there, and iam in Indianapolis alot for work. It reminded me of the hotel in \"The Shining\".", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis", "Title": "\u201cFabulous\u201d", "Author": "CEF909", "ReviewID": "UR7289128", "Content": "I am a member of the Columbia Club and decided to book a suite for the weekend.

Traveling from California, I arranged for my club to reserve a room at the CC for three nights. Located on Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis, this venerable 1930s 10 story club looks like something out of a 1940 British mens's club. Beautiful wood paneling and red leather wing chairs, butter colored leather chairs and booths in the bar and Harrison Room, two other restaurants and bars in the Club. Rooms on several floors have been gutted and beautifully refurbished with all the amenities of a 5 star hotel. Staff is cordial, discreet and accomodating. I can understand why every recent American president has stayed here. This is truly a rare gem in a city that is vibrant and on the move.
