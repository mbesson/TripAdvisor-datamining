The hotel is a 10-15 min walk from Euston station and is very conveniently located in the leafy area of Bloomsbury. Our room was small and fairly basic with the usual TV, tea and coffee making facilities etc. Not luxury but just what we needed for a base for the weekend. Would reccommend going down early for breakfast as there will be a queue. You may also find yourself sharing a larger table with another group if it is very busy. Breakfast food was great, if you get the full English option there is a good selection of hot food and you can also help yourself to bread and cereals. The continental option would be fine also as there seemed to be a good selection of toast, cereals and fruit. Bar prices seemed very reasonable for London. Do not come here for a romantic break, it's not that kind of place!

We turned the radiator off and opened the window to cool the room down, but the room never cooled down and we had to sleep with the window wide open and only a sheet on the bed as a cover. With the window open (our window looked into a central open area which must be above the kitchens) we had a constant noise of extractor fans and smell of food wafting into the room. I would hate to think what it is like in the summer as there is no air conditioning and our stay was in February!! The room was small which you can expect in London but so was the double bed and my husbands feet hung out of the bottom of it. I have to say that the room and bathroom were clean. Only 2 coat hangers in the open wardrobe area but plenty of drawer space. Small bars of soap in the bathroom but no shampoo so bring toiletries with you. A kettle is provided with only 2 packets of coffee so again if you like a cuppa after a long day sightseeing bring extra coffee and coffee mate. We only had continental breakfast offered with our booking and went down to sample it the first morning but only had a slice of toast and disgusting strong coffee which practicaly took the enamel off your teeth.

Two free full English breakfast each morning: brilliant choice of food including fruit, cereal, fried and scrambles eggs, plum tomatoes, beans, sausages, some kind of fish, toast, jam, tea, coffee and juice. We went down between 8.30am and 9am and didn't have to wait for a table, although there were periods when people were queuing. Two free evening meals or lunches: there are a few choices of where you can eat, but on both evenings we chose to eat at Jaques' wine bar at the hotel. There is a varied set menu you can choose from. The portions are very generous and the food is well cooked and lovely. I'd recommend the farmhouse pate and chicken with brandy and cream sauce - lovely!!! The staff were very friendly and efficient too. Very impressed. A free drink on arrival: as we arrived quite late we had our drink with our meal and you can choose anything. The house wine was nice. With regards to the room itself, it was basic but clean - you definitely get what you pay for in this respect. I was lucky enough to be given a double when I'd only paid for a single (in order to be eligible for the free child place my daughter had to sleep in a room with two adults, so was supposed to be going in with my parents). The room wasn't very big, but it had a decent sized wardrobe and plenty of drawers. It had a TV and a kettle, and some small bars of soap in the bathroom - so take your own shampoo, shower gel etc. The bed wasn't the comfiest thing I've ever slept in and our room overlooked the main road, which was very noisy even on the sixth floor with the windows shut. I was also 'lucky' enough to get noisy neighbours above and the floors seem to be paper thin. I'd recommend taking ear plugs. The location of the hotel in relation to the sights is excellent. We were able to walk everywhere and didn't resort to public transport once - although the aches and pains in my legs today make me wish we had. It took us roughly 20 minutes to walk to St Paul's Cathedral and to walk back from Regent Road. If you don't like walkimg, there seemed to be plenty of buses passing close by the hotel and an open top bus tour starts very close by too. Overall I would recommend the hotel and most definitely if the 'Let's Go Weekend' offer is on. I couldn't find anything else that compared price wise in London and it meant we had a fantastic weekend for a very resonable price. My key piece of advice is to expect what you pay for.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel to stay\u201d", "Author": "Maccisco", "ReviewID": "UR121678400", "Content": "We were on a week-end trip and the Travistock is a great place to stay in London.

On 25th got to my room - it looked out onto the inner courtyard roof - also a mess with scaffolding but worse - right out side the bedroom window, cigarette buts and used toilet paper! Absolutely disgusting and set up my impression for the rest of the stay. I had no breakfast on the Saturday (though mhad paid for it) as the place was awash with noise, chaos, and disorganisation. Returned saturday evening 10.30pm - noise was exrcutiatingly loud in the foyer. Got to my room - noise louder still - thump, thump, thump of a function below, window pains vibration, curtains shaking! I went to reception to ask that the noise be turned down. And was told \"but we have private function!\" SO? The short oriental boy on reeption just was not interested and indeed just turned away, ignored me. H ehad no clue (probably no training) how to deal with a dissastified customer. I went to the DJ and asked him to turn down the noise - in entering the function suite the noise was so loud that there was distortion from the speakers. Went to the porters to complain - got the same nonsense \"we have a party\" - SO. You also have roomed guests. I asked to speak to a manager. \"there is no manager on duty at night!\" Appalling - when staff are so incompetent and uncaring in their attitude and there is no manager. It speaks volumes. I then asked if someone could come to my room to lsiten to the noise. No! A Spanish night poret, Juan, arrived - his attitude was even worse and all he did was proboke and made the situation a thousand times worse - threatening the guest! I returned to my room and decided to ring the council noise abatement people. Tried to make a call from my bedroom. Got the hotel operator - \"you don'thave a phone in your room.\" \"Interesting, I am calling from it!\" Was put through to reception -\"You did not take out an account when you sigend in.\" \"Well no one told me I had to!\" \"If you want to phone you have to come to reception and make out an account.\" I could go on - this hotel has absoltuely no interest in its guests - systems are for the convenience of staff - who are poor quality, and inadequately trained - if they are trained at all.

As many of the reviews state, the location is excellent but there are no frills, e.g., you get two towels only, no bathroom items such as shampoo, and the pillows are about three inches thick although there were two for each of our twin beds. The hotel is generally clean and comfortable and a bargain considering what the average London hotel costs. However we were put in a room right above the bowling alley on the west side of the building. The noise from people talking, drinking and smoking under our window made sleep impossible so at 11 pm the first night I requested, and was given, a quiet room in the back of the hotel. If you want relative quiet, request a room facing the back not one of the the three street sides. As with the other Imperial Hotels, you have a short walk to the Russell Square tube station where you can get to Heathrow on the Picadilly line for about 2.80 GBP off peak and 4.50 peak. The trip takes one hour and except for about 18 steps in the Russell Square tube station, you can rely on elevators. There are at least a dozen pubs within a quarter mile of the hotel. However we found that on four consecutive nights (Mon through Thurs), every pub except the London pub was standing room only by 6:00 pm and most patrons appeared to be Londoners. Considering a pint of Guiness costs about $6.50, tiny London flats rent for $600 or more a WEEK, and most jobs pay less than they do in the US, I am amazed that so many people seem to have enough extra money to keep the pubs and many restaurants packed.

Basically, it's just a bit tired and dated and the rooms need a refurb. Ours was enormous - it was a triple, and with disabled access to boot - but only had one chair and a stool and lots of empty space, and bare walls, which all meant it felt cold and soulless. The bed felt as though it was going to be way too springy for a comfortable night's sleep, and although the pillows weren't brilliant, we actually slept quite well. Lighting was OK in the places that mattered - over the bed, and over the mirrors in the bathroom and bedroom, but again, didn't feel 'cosy'.

I stayed here with my partner for a 3 night short break to the city and have to say that I was very surprised indeed by the quality of the accommodation and service on offer - for approximately the same cost, many of the big travel sites were suggesting that we stay either very far away from the attractions or in a dodgy converted townhouse so to get a clean, comfortable, modern room with en suite facilities _and_ a decent breakfast for \u00c2\u00a395 a night was amazing! Located opposite the University of London and very near to the British Medical Association, the hotel is just a 10 minute walk from Kings Cross/St Pancras and only a few minutes from Russell Square tube station so it's very easy to get around if you don't fancy walking too far - that said, the Bloomsbury location means that it's almost as quick to walk to all the major sites without too much trouble. The hotel was undergoing some major refurbishment work (which seems to include changing the windows) so there was some heavy duty scaffolding covering the facade but it's a handsome Art Deco building underneath. The scaffolding does mean that there was no real view to be had from any of the windows on the street sides but that wasn't a huge issue. Reception was clean with free Wi-Fi available and check in was quick and easy. There's a separate desk for the porters (who can apparently organise trips and whatnot) and a comfortable lounge bar and cafe off to the sides. The general corridors were looking a bit rough around the edges but, again, they were clean and no different to any high volume hotel that I've stayed in previously Our room (327) was of a good size with a comfy double bed, flat screen TV, hairdryer and a very good en suite bathroom. All cleaned to a good standard and clearly recently refurbished. The shower was amazing - I've never come across a hotel shower with that sort of consistent high pressure! The only real issue I can think of was the room temperature - it was very hot in there initially and the traffic noise and scaffolding meant that leaving the window wide open wasn't a great idea but we didn't find it excessively difficult to get the temperature down to a reasonable level (we're used to traffic noise!). The famous (infamous?) breakfast was included in the price and consisted of the usual trappings of the \"full English\" with a fairly poor selection of fruits for those unlucky enough to only have the Continental included in their price. It was very busy so seating was a little bit hit and miss but the waiting staff did a good job of getting things cleared away quickly. The actual food was as you'd expect for a hotel breakfast - filling, hot and generally pretty good but not likely to win any awards.

I'm delighted to say that this time everything was fine, the shower was powerful and warm, I was in my room a little before 2pm. It was obviously a single room because of the single bed there, but there was loads of space and plenty of drawers, coathangers, etc, for clothes and other items. And what a treat to find a fridge in the room! I came back at 11.30 after a great night out and really enjoyed my chilled drink. The girl at reception was pleasant enough, though English wasn't her first language - I wonder if the people who criticise the staff as 'rude' take that into account? There was no 'do not disturb' sign on my door and the porters couldn't find one but promised to bring one upstairs.... some places I've stayed at somehow manage to forget little things like that, but almost as soon as I was back in my room, there was a tap at my door and one of the porters smiling, holding out the sign. Top-class service! Other good things: Nice to have an armchair to sit on to read, much nicer than just a stool. English breakfasts are wasted on me as I dislike eggs and red meat, so the choice of fruit and cereal was just right. In the best of all possible worlds, a desk would have been lovely, as I like to do a bit of scribbling after a night out - it takes me time to come down from a high after a good West End musical - but I managed fine sitting in the armchair with my notebook. I can't review the television because I rarely have time to watch TV when I'm staying in London. Other points worth noting - a good basic shopping area is a block away, but if you want more variation, Euston station is just up the road. For those who can use the Underground, Russell Sqare is just round the corner, but for the escalator-phobic like myself, the No. 91 bus to the West End can be caught just over the road. The ever-helpful porters found me a taxi within 5 minutes when it was time to check out. For those who've said the hotel is too hot - maybe a little, but have you tried opening the window for a short while? It makes all the difference, even if it's just for a few minutes. And all this for less than \u00c2\u00a350 a night (booked online or through an agent).

The room was of a good size and I have been allocated much smaller rooms in much more expensive hotels in London. Both the room and bathroom where clean and fresh.

Located within a few minutes walk of Euston with bus stops outside and Russell Sq tube round the corner it gives easy access to major attractions without paying top prices. Part of the Imperial chain it is not as big as their sister hotel round the corner and therefore retains individual character and service. Breakfast is particularly pleasant with a mixture of waiter and self service. The hotel has its own bistro type restaurant bar, but the food is not fantastic. If you stay for two nights you usually get a voucher to eat in a choice of nearby restaurants, most of which are in the chain's hotels. We went on a Let's Go Weekend, which included two nights' breakfast, evening meal and a welcome cocktail on arrival, free parking and no extra charge for single rooms at a very reasonable price of \u00c2\u00a3115. The bar is relaxing with comfy sofas and a nice atmosphere, no noisy music and a tv if you want to watch it. On the downside, the hotel is on the corner of two busy roads so there is constant traffic noise. It also sometimes has discos in a function room which go on till the early hours and can be noisy. However the rooms have extra sliding windows which shut out most of the noise, particularly on the high floors, if you can bear to sleep with them shut as the rooms are quite hot. Overall, I find this a very comfortable and pleasant hotel at a very reasonable price.

In truth this was not a quiet room, with the window open there was a constant noise from some extraction fans but with the window closed it was reduced to a reasonable level. The courtyard was in fact the top of the public rooms and the scaffolded roof of the service yard. The exterior brickwork was grey, making this a most unattractive feature.

The personnel communicated with us immediately when we made our way towards the counter. They answered all our questions throughout the stay without any trouble at all. They explained several alternatives for us getting to the airport and they booked us a taxi (since our flight was too early for us to take the underground). They also rang and made sure we were on our way when the taxi reached the hotel the following morning. The breakfast is a bit hectic, with lots of guests wanting to eat at the same time. We never had to wait for a table though. It was open 7am-10am, and we (as probably many others) went there ~9.30am. Maybe calmer at earlier times.

No real issues with the bed (perhaps only to stop it rolling when trying to lean against the back wall, since the bed was on wheels without a built-in stopping mechanism - but our luggage worked as a substitute). It was quite noisy from the street below, especially the first night (Mon-Tue) for some reason - a lot of ambulances with sirens (maybe the many central hospitals take turns being all-night emergency wards?). Earplugs very recommended. The cleaning service worked very well the few days we were there. If one scoured the corners or under the bed, dust and such were to be found, but personally it was really not an issue (nothing else to expect with fitted carpets, I guess). The floor outside and inside was a bit creaky, but it didn't affect me (as I said: earplugs). Free wifi in the lobby which seemed to be extensively utilized by the guests. Personally I didn't have any luck with it, it being far too slow to even manage to load our airline's web page for check-in purposes. Maybe I hit the rush hour. It is situated among many other hotels between Euston and Russel Square. Cash machine, retail stores and many food places are within a minute of the hotel. I didn't try the in-hotel restaurant/bar. Next time in London I will definitely keep Tavistock Hotel in mind, and I will recommend it to friends.

My focus isn't to spend a fortune in London as I know from bitter experience that more expensive frequently does not mean better. The Tavistock is a medium size hotel about 10 minutes walk from Kings Cross and 5 minutes from Euston - so easy to drag your cases there. To boot you are also about 10 minutes walk from Tottenham Court Road and the same from the British Museum. There are quite a few pubs and restaraunts tucked away in the locality. Booking in was quick and the room clean and tidy. It looks like there has been a refurbishment but you still see snatches of former elegance. Each side of the hotel has it's points; the front overlooks Tavistock Square which is nice but noisy if you have the windows open. The sides overlook main roads and the rear the aircon units. Based on this I would suggest facing outwards if at all possible! Breakfast is a buffet affair and the choice is yours (cereals, toast, full English etc) and sometimes with the numbers of foreign tourists you could kid yourself you were abroad.

He will leave with a further request to only shower with the windows and curtains open, and expressing the hope that this will not happen again. Your pleasure will be increased by a repeat performance late at night two days later, with the guests this time half undressed for bed. There is a variation in that this time there will be an accusation that smoking in the room has been the cause, as the shower had not been used. We are both non-smokers. A final flourish is provided by the most senior person available to speak to in a group of three hotels is the receptionist. He will agree to report this to his line manager in the morning, but will not do so. In fact you will later find out that there is no-one of any seniority available until after the weekend. The crowning point is the inability of this senior manger to either reply to or even acknowledge a complaint, nine days after it was made. On the plus side the hotel is pretty conveniently placed. Jacques Bistro is fairly priced and quite good, though smells from its kitchen permeate the corridor behind it, where some of the lifts are placed. Breakfast is OK, the coffee is not. The shower head in our room was very high up and only capable of small adjustments.

They would not listen to any reasoning and shrugged shoulders and said 'Go complain then'. .... It must be the only hotel which I then had to pay up front for on my credit card BEFORE I had stayed a night! To say the hotel is tired is like saying Rip Van Winkel is an energetic livewire. It absolutely reeks under investment, except in paying the cheapest possible wages presumably for the staff. The old adage 'pay peanuts' etc rings a giant bell. The room far from being a double was a twin. My colleague who had booked a single got a double (as I found out the following day). Bed was about as small as you can possibly get for a single and one who's springs had obviously been in use since before World War 2 as you needed pitons to move in it anywhere away from the middle. The pillows were so disgusting that it still sends shivers down my back. Towels weren't really towels, more like table napkins with as much mopping up power as a piece of rice paper! Breakfast was OK but if you wanted anything other than semi skimmed milk... forget it. They specialise in toast so soggy and chewy that your average tiger would give up trying to chew it. Coffee looked like and tasted probably like a sample from the lower reaches of the River Thames. The shower was the only good thing about the entire place except for checking out one day early as I couldn't stand another night in the place.

The noise of the disco was deafening with the window closed, which meant that we had to try to sleep in a room with temperatures like a sauna, as there was no way of controlling the heating. In the morning, we found that the kettle did not work. I phoned housekeeping and a young girl came to the room. After fiddling with the switch and the plug for several minutes, she diagnosed that it must be the fuse and took the kettle away. It was 20 minutes before it was returned.

Of course, an elevator was kaput and there were signs around that there would be no water of any kind in many rooms during the day. It has been this way for 30 years.

But, there were some good reviews and the location looked great, so I went ahead and booked for the first four nights of my stay in London. I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is a bargain hotel. That is the bottom line. That said, it exceeded my expectations. I arrived from the States on a Sunday and did some visiting before checking in. Though it was before the stated check in time, I was given a room right away. It was on a top floor overlooking Woburn Pl. During my week there, yes I extended my stay for the full 7 nights I was in London, I had no problem with noise. The room was clean and I had a huge bathtub in the bathroom, a nice touch. The bed was small but comfortable and the room was made up every day. The only complaint was that the room was warm, but I know not to expect air conditioning in a budget hotel in the UK or Europe. Breakfast was a very pleasant surprise. It was a full English Breakfast served in a pleasant dining room. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. The location of the hotel is great, perfect for getting around all of London. Tavistock Square is right across the street and is a gem. The Russell Square tube station is just a short walk away, there are numerous and very convenient bus lines right outside, and the rail stations are just a hop away. This was very convenient as one morning I had to get a very early train for Paris. There are a few reasonable places to eat in the area, which is welcome in a city as expensive as London. There is a great take away that I discovered my next to last day about a block east on Tavistock Place. London is one of the great cities of the world. This was my first trip back in about 35 years, though I am in Europe regularly. My MO is to wander about as much as I can, both far and wide. For this I got a weekly pass for most of the London area. I picked it up at Gatwick Airport and it turned out that it also gave me a reduction on my train ticket into London. I recommend getting to know the buses. They are complicated, but what a good way they are to get around London and to really get to see it. In fact, I have never had any problem with getting on the wrong, or any, bus and seeing where it would take me.

I guess a \"double\" room does not mean the same thing as it does in the states. We had to push the twin beds together to fit two adults and one child in the room. The view out the window was of the center of the hotel. All we saw was a machine of sorts. An air conditioning unit? though there was no AC in our room. London never got hot enough to expect an AC in a hotel room but the hotel itself was an oven. We had to leave the window open to cool off but since we were facing the inside of the hotel (it's set up in a square) everyone could see inside our room and we could see inside everyone else's rooms. The first thing our son did when we got there was open the door to run out in the hallway. We locked it but it made no difference since the lock would unlatch with a turn of the handle. We had to keep the window shut while he was awake because he could easily climb out of it and fall to his death. We fried. It was so hot in there. At one point my husband had to shave and couldn't make warm water because there are two separate knobs for each temperature. Granted he could fill the sink with warm water but if you like to rinse soap off your hands or face with warm clean water, you're screwed. Either cold or hot. There's an outlet in the bathroom with European and American plugs but they are outdated with the wrong voltage and the American plug won't fit the new types of prongs with one side that is wider. The \"iron available upon request\" is an ironing room on the first floor. They don't have irons for individual use. We were forced to pay for a crib for our toddler for our entire stay due to \"safety reasons\" but were delivered something that was two seconds from falling apart. Again, something completely outdated, a wooden crib that I doubt meets the safety standards of today. Total waste of money and hotel space. We didn't have much to start with. Absolutely no ammenities. We had bars of soap and towels. Bare minimum! No wash cloths, no shampoo. TP was scarce and I prayed that we wouldn't run out every day. The internet access is a public use computer in the lobby, 1 pound per 15 minutes. I had to help people figure out how to use it every time I walked by and when I used it, I had to lean over at a weird angle so my wrists wouldn't cramp up. I saw people using laptops in the lobby so I assume they have wireless access in that area. Not sure about the rest of the hotel but our room did not have it. We hardly spent any time in our room at all. We were only there in the evenings after we were done site seeing and eating dinner and we were still incredibly unhappy with this place.

What was once a great little budget motel is now a rundown nightmare. We had the same problems mentioned in previous reviews - noise from the lounge and bowling alley every night. Since the Tavistock has no air conditioning, sleeping with the windows open is a necessity when the weather is less than cold. However it is impossible with the racquet going on until 0230 or 0300 hours every night from the bowling alley and/or bar. Even closing the windows had no effect. The music and loud partying was so loud that closing the windows only had the slightest effect. The partying seemed to mostly come from the lounge guests at the hotel spilling out onto the front sidewalk to smoke. In addition to the constant noise after 7 p.m., the bed was so bad that at 11 p.m., I got up, got dressed, went down to the front desk and told them they HAD to get me a bed I could sleep in. I've never had a night's sleep interrupted by an uncomfortable bed - I can sleep on just about anything but this bed was awful. It wasn't just mine as I heard complaints from other guests in the elevators every morning. The front desk staff was responsive to my complaints and sent 2 bellhops up to remove my mattress and replace it with a \"new\" one. This is obviously a complaint they'd heard before. The pillows were awful as well. They gave me one pillow that was the size of an airline pillow and another one that appeared bigger but squished down to nothing when you put your head on it. While we're on the topic of beds, my traveling companion in the room next to me said that his bed was nothing more than a rollaway bed and whenever he tried to sit up in bed he had to lean against the wall (no headbord) and since the bed was on wheels, it rolled the bed away from the wall when he tried to sit up in bed. No brakes on the wheels. It was awful. In addition to being run down and having extremely poor maintenance on the old rooms, the maids left the only glass they provided every day without replacing it with a clean one. A room with 2 beds only had one towell and one glass. The toilets flushed only some of the time. Breakfast is included and I must say that this feature of the hotel was as good as previous visits (not that it was outstanding to start with but at least it didn't deteriorate). However, the staff left dirty dishes all over the restaurant leaving guests to try to use tables in the closed section just to have a table without someone else's leftover dishes and food. They got quite snotty when you tried to get to the clean tables but showed no effort to keep the tables in the open section clean. They certainly weren't overwhelmed getting guests coffee and tea as they did a lousy job of doing that too. This was my last stay at the Tavistock.

It's within walking distance from Euston, Kings Cross and St. Pancras stations to the north of it and convenient to Covent Garden and the West End. I'm a fast walker; Covent Garden is about 15-25 minutes on foot with no difficulty. The rooms are clean, quite small and uninspiring.

While breakfast is certainly not a high point, the porridge, corn flakes, hardboiled eggs, and rolls were certainly adequate. At 64 pounds a night, this is a very good deal for central London. Take a face cloth, shampoo, and some nice soap with you -- the rather thin towels are changed daily. Yes, there was some road noise, but it is very hard to be both in the middle of London close to tube stations, railway stations, and many bus lines, and yet away from busy roads. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. A great (and pleasant) surprise for me was the discovery that hotels and restaurants in Britain are now smoke free. This is a tremendous improvement for hotels like the Tavistock -- no more smoke haze in the lobby. I have stayed in a variety of hotels in London over the last five years: my strong impression is that unless you are lucky, or visiting in the winter, you have to pay roughly twice as much per night as at the Tavistock to be pretty sure of getting a better room. If there is a heat wave when you are visiting London, it may make sense to pay for a higher quality hotel, but London heat waves are generally quite infrequent and of short duration. If you stay at the Tavistock, you are close to many of the major tourist attractions, or an easy bus ride away.

This is perfect for buying those goodies to bring home. The hotel is busy and for the most part the staff is very friendly. Some of the Front Desk staff had a problem understanding English and were a bit snippy. The guests are a mix of tourists and business people. Our room was in the front of the hotel overlooking Tavistock Square. On the downside, the noise from the pub just along the street is a bit much on Friday and Saturday evenings. But our initial room was a very small room right by the elevator. We asked for a better room and were given one the next day. We would have been given a new room that day but the hotel was full. The staff even moved our luggage to the new room for us. This room was a good size with a bay window. There was plenty of room for our things. The breakfast room is very pleasant and there is plenty of choice for hot and cold food. The coffee is awful though.

(I think English, which was mentioned in the previous review, is indeed a problem for a lot of staff). The hotel was probably once quite grand but now looks very shabby and run down. The rooms are small and outdated, but acceptable for the price in central London. What I did find to be rather 'cheap' were the beverage packs where you get one tea bag and powdered creamer - which tasted foul - per day. You also only get a few small tablets of cheap soap in the bathroom - no shampoo or anything. I wasn't expecting the Ritz but this felt like any expense spared on the guest was begrudged! The website stated that rooms had hair dryers but failed to say you need to leave a \u00c2\u00a320 deposit to use one and they're not even modern ones! As with the other reviews here breakfast was awful and staff unhelpful - when I asked for tea I was brought half a cup of luke warm slop! The toast was barely shown to a toaster and the juices cheap and watered down. I normally enjoy taking breakfast in a hotel but my advice would be don't bother.

I did read the reviews here beforehand but went ahead with the booking because the price was reasonable considering it's in central London and the reviews were not that bad!! First the good points: The hotel is in an excellent location. Less than 10 minutes walk from both Euston station (which has mainline and underground services) and Russel Square underground station (on the Piccadilly line). It really is simple to get to both and like previous reviewers, the journey is easy and you can feel pretty safe even at night. The next good point, there seems to be plenty of hot water as we had showers at odd times and never had a problem getting hot water with good pressure. So what's wrong with it? Firstly the hotel is in desperate need of a revamp. The decor and furnishings are looking very tired. The carpets are straight out of the 70s with garish floral designs. If you are used to modern, clean looking hotels then you will be disappointed. I agree with a previous reviewer who commented on the strange room allocation system. We booked a few weeks in advance for a double room but were given a twin instead. All the doubles apparently having gone even though we had booked one and had received confirmation. This could of course be Hoteopia's fault, difficult to tell. The room we got was on the 7th floor although there were 2 lifts, both working and seemingly reliable. The rooms are very basic, 2 single beds, a bedside table, desk, old TV (with no remote) and a simple small-ish bathroom with old fashioned bath taps which switch to being a shower although ours only managed to switch half way with a lot of the water spurting out of the tap fitting instead of going into the shower head! The shower does not adjust at all so if you are tall like me you have to crouch down! There is no iron in the rooms (there was a trouser press although I am not sure who uses these things anymore!). Instead there is an \"ironing room\" which is on the first floor. A tad inconvenient having to go down 6 floors only to find it closed. Also there are no hair dryers as my girlfriend found out. Instead you can borrow a model from the 1950s for a \u00c2\u00a320 deposit! The two towels you are given have to be the thinnest towels I have ever seen. I have very short hair but still found it difficult to dry myself without the towel being completely saturated each time. My girlfriend has long curly hair and she had no chance! We had to ask for more towels and were given 2 more thread bare examples. They do not seem to understand hand towels. At least we could rotate them with 4!! You don't mind the above problems because you have probably paid a reasonable price considering the central location. The main problem with this hotel is the staff. I appreciate that this is not the Hilton or anything approaching it however one expects that staff working in a hotel would receive some kind of training as to what is expected in a hotel!! First things first, almost all of the staff are foreign. I think throughout our entire stay we came across only one member of staff that could actually speak proper English. They can often be heard speaking amongst themselves in small groups in all manner of languages other than English. If people can speak multiple languages as well as English that is to be applauded and I have no problem in them being foreign providing they can at least speak English. This is London after all.! The cleaners were loud, chattering in groups of 4 or 5 outside your room at 8.00am when you are trying to get some sleep. They seemed to completely ignore the \"do not disturb\" signs on the door, often trying to open the doors whilst we were trying to sleep. Luckily the doors had an additional catch on them however this is still a huge disturbance when you are trying to sleep. They also seemed to like to open 4 or 5 rooms at once to clean and were therefore opening/closing doors and chatting to their colleagues for over an hour just outside our room. The cleaners were bad however the real problem is the restaurant and bar staff. I don't believe they have been given any kind of training as to what customers might expect when having a meal or ordering a drink. Trying to get a coffee in the morning was almost impossible. We had to ask the same waiter (on 2 mornings in a row) 3 times for some coffee and when he eventually brought it, he inexplicably put it down on an empty table next to us! On one occasion he said yes then just completely ignored me and carried on with what he was doing then walked away! I could not really believe it was happening in a hotel charging almost \u00c2\u00a3100 a night! Most of the staff just seem to be wandering around the restaurant area trying to look busy!! The tables are dirty, not made up at all. The staff were ushering us to sit down at a table that had dirty knives, used napkins, butter stains and jam all over the table. Asking for fresh cutlery was as painful as trying to get coffee. In every hotel I have been in before, the tables are remade or at least cleaned after each customer leaves. This is what I expect in a hotel. The breakfast was basic and to be honest the quality was pretty poor although there was at least plenty of it should you be hungry. The juices had clearly been watered down, not something you would expect in a hotel! We asked to leave our bags on the day of check-out which we could do but were then charged by one of the staff. Whether this was hotel policy or just the staff making a bit on the side is unclear. I certainly don't recall being charged for this service at any other hotel I have stayed at. Overall if you not bothered about service or facilities and just need somewhere to lay your head for a few nights whilst visiting London then this hotel will do the job, especially given the location. However, if the hotel is in anyway meant to compliment your holiday or visit then look elsewhere or you will be disappointed.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal", "Title": "\u201cI keep returning to the Tavistock\u201d", "Author": "AnglophileMontreal", "ReviewID": "UR10922973", "Content": "This was my sixth stay at the Tavistock.

As I leafed through the glossy photographs of stylish interiors, the Tavistock was diametrically opposed to them in every way. The other thought which came to me on entering the hotel was a line from the film Withnail and I... \"It was like walking into a lung. A sulfur-stained, nicotine yellow and fly-blown lung.\" Back in the 1930s it was probably a nice enough place - the problem is that much of the hotel has not been updated since then (and I don't mean that in a good way). To be fair, some parts of the place probably did receive a lick of paint and some new carpet in the eighties.... The decor is shabby throughout, punctuated only by numerous peculiar signs advising, for example, to keep your window shut in windy weather 'for safety reasons'. The only room that they had available when I stayed was a smoking room, which stank. This is something which it had in common with the bar - a dire place full of ashen-faced clientelle and surly, rude bar staff. I was amazed to discover that there was no shower gel or shampoo provided in the room, only some incredibly pungent bars of soap. Similarly disappointing were the tea and coffee facilities - a resealable plastic bag containing loose tea bags, powdered milk and a plastic spoon. In any case, the kettle looked so ancient and discoloured that I didn't touch it. The price included breakfast, but I was warned off this by a fellow guest, and I wasn't chancing it anyway - by the time morning came I couldn't leave the place fast enough. To get out onto the pavement and breathe the fresh air of freedom once more was by far the best part of the whole experience.

The room had a hot pot in it to boil water, which we found very convenient to make those Cup-o-noodle type soups that we bought at the nearby convenience store. Great late night snack when the jet lag kicks in! The lobby bar is smokey and vintage, but we actually spent one full night of our vacation there with a friend that we met at a different bar! It's a nice little joint, reasonably priced and the bartender was very fun. The free breakfast is basically coffee, juice, and toast, but it does the trick to get you through till lunch. The cooked breakfast is expensive and didn't look all that appetizing. The hotel is located only a few blocks from the Russel Square stop on the Piccadilly Line. Be that as it may, we chose to walk to many of the sights, including London Tower, Tower Bridge, Covent Garden, and Piccadilly Circus. It's not a short distance, but if you don't mind huffing it there, you can always catch the underground home. Just don't get stuck too late, or you'll miss the last tube back!

I cope with this as it is cheap ;o) The staff are friendly and helpful, although I found the bar staff a little rude as they nudged their tips basket towards me as I paid for a drink. Given the choice I wouldn't drink there (nice pubs nearby), and I wouldn't eat dinner there either. I have done so once and the food was very disappointing for the money.

This time however, I wasn't nearly as happy. For starters, I only had a short time in London, and wanted to see as much as possible before dark. After delays on the plane and underground, I was happy to finally reach the hotel and get started site seeing. Apparently they were training a new staff member, so our check-in took twice as long as it should have, with each detail being explained step by step. Now they didn't know we were in a hurry, so I can't really blame them for that, it was just frustrating. When we reached our room on the 4th floor I was somewhat disappointed. It was smaller than the room on the higher floor we had last year, and the bathroom was tiny! Much, much smaller than the one last year. Everything seemed just as clean as before though. However, when I took a bath that night, I found hairs all over the bathroom, including in the tub that didn't belong to us. The towels left a lot to be desired too. There were two thin, rough towels and nothing else. No wash clothes, which I know is sometimes normal, but there wasn't even an extra towel to dry your hands on after washing them. Since it was raining, dark, and nearly all the attractions had closed, and we had to be at Victoria by 5:30 a.m. the next morning, we made a short night of it, and were back at the hotel by 19:45. We stopped by the front desk on our way up to our room to arrange for a taxi the next morning. We were told, in an almost rude way, that we needed the porters desk. We turned, and just as when we came in there was nobody there, which is why we went to the front desk in the first place. We turned back to her and were told he was probably just in the back. After finally getting the porters attention, he told us to call back after 21:00 because the night shift porter would be there. Glad we weren't going to bed early! Couldn't he have just taken our information and passed it on? At any rate, we waited, and called down to the porter after 21:00 and arranged the taxi for 5:00 a.m. We also requested a 4:00 a.m. wake up call. Last year, I had no problems with the traffic, but being on a lower floor, and on a corner near a busy intersection, that's all I heard all night long! I know I must have slept, but I sure don't remember it. It felt like I was awake all night long listening to traffic! At 10 minutes before 4:00, our wake up call came. Thank goodness for the extra time, because at 15 minutes before 5:00, I heard honking outside, I looked down to see our taxi waiting for us! We grabbed up all of our things and dashed for the elevator. When we got down there, the meter was running! I was too tired to argue or complain and was just glad to be getting home. We left too early for breakfast, but like everyone else has expressed, if it's the same as it was last year, it's better skipped anyway. All in all, for the price, location, and the overall quality (which I know is still there somewhere, maybe above the 4th floor perhaps?) you can't really beat this hotel. The staff aren't nearly as pleasing as they were, but hotel staff come and go, so it could be an all new staff next time.

I booked through the British Airways website. The cost for a single is 61 pounds sterling and a double is 82 pounds. There are sometimes small discounts available online, but this is a very good price for London. What I liked: There is a lift (elevator). The public rooms, my room and the bathroom were spotless. The room always smelled fresh and was obviously cleaned thoroughly every day. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. The staff were helpful, especially the boys at the concierge desk. My suitcase split its zipper on the day I had to travel and they found me some heavy duty tape to mend it for the flight. They also helped me insert the sim card in my new mobile phone. They also help you with your luggage if you want. Ladies appreciate these things. I was given a room with two single beds (I am not sure they have any rooms with just one bed) for that price of 61 pounds. It had the beds, a cupboard with hangers, a desk unit with drawers for clothes and a television. It also had enough room to move around without bruising yourself. My room looked out onto Tavistock Gardens at the front and had double glazing to combat traffic noise. The area is very handy for everything. You have Russell Square tube station a couple of blocks away (on the Picadilly line for coming from Heathrow), you can walk to Tottenham Court Road and Goodge Street Station is also within walking distance. It is easy to get to any sights without spending ages on the tube. The area seemed very safe as there was always plenty of movement due to the proximity of London University. There are coffee places, laundries, pubs and restaurants all around the area. There is an internet place a couple of blocks away, as well as a Waterstones bookshop to buy a map or guide to London if you need it. In short: cleanliness, location, value for money. What I did not like: I am not a breakfast person so the breakfast was not an issue with me but it might be for others. In the price of your room you get a continental breakfast. This consisted of a basket of cold, if fresh, rolls on the table. You get a glass of juice too. There are little packets of jam and butter. A member of the staff brings you tea or coffee in a cup. I had tea and it was not delicious. I reminded myself that I don\u00c2\u00b4t like breakfast anyway so what was I doing there and I left after making a small dent in a roll and taking two sips of tea. You can pay for a cooked breakfast and this costs under 5 pounds, which is also a good price. It was a buffet and seemed to have everything you might want but I didn\u00c2\u00b4t.

Staff is sometimes a little clueless but quite decent. TV worked fine. Now, the warnings. No air conditioning. I was on the 8th floor during an unusual heat wave. Hottest floor. With the window open, just about able to sleep at night. Make sure you read the phone charges card in one of the drawers. They charge 1.50 pounds to connect you to some phone card lines. At the breakfast buffet, you have to pick and choose. Scrambled eggs in large chafing dish were watery and unbelievably bland. Coffee undrinkable. Go for tea. Poached and hard-boiled eggs are okay. Use the toast and make an egg sandwich. Cereals good. It is, however, quite boring as it is the same stuff every day.

It's a basic, comfortable, clean hotel, safe for a single woman traveler. I first stayed in a room with two single beds on the 6th floor, overlooking the street, but the street noise was too much for me. The front desk staff (who were all very nice, and helped me out with restaurant recommendations) then moved me to an end room with one bed and a refrigerator, also on the 6th floor, with no view other than the rooftop and other rooms, but it was quiet. After an overnight trip out of town, I checked into a hotel near Paddington Station (the Ashley) because it was cheaper and had gotten some good reviews on this site -- however, I immediately checked out after having an allergy attack due to dust/mildew/mold, and went back to the Tavistock. Had a room with two single beds on the 7th floor; there were holes in the wallpaper, but it was still comfortable. My only criticisms, really, are the awful English breakfast, and the thin walls. However, I found a great place called ICCO on Goodge Street, a short walk away, that has excellent coffee. If you order a hot drink before noon, you also get a free croissant.

The room had two single beds, TV, kettle and sachets of tea/coffee (but very poor quality, so if you are a coffee drinker I recommend one brings a small plunger and buys coffee), trouser press. Not sure if the single rate automatically provides twin beds, but I didn't complain. The beds were rather narrow, but I guess they are the standard size. The bedspreads seemed a little tired and could be due for replacement. Quiet location apart from the occasional siren or motor bike racing down Southampton Row. Bathroom was simple, basic but fine for one's needs - no frills. Powerful shower and plenty of hot water. The English breakfast offered poached or scrambled eggs, English back bacon, sausages, tomatoes (tinned), beans, porridge, cereals, orange and gapefruit segments (tinned but fine), toast and even haddock.

I would recommend this hotel over the others in the Imperial Hotels group (Imperial, President, Royal National etc). It is cheaper than the others including the Royal National, next door, which I entered and thought resembled a barracks! Just too big and absolutely NO appearance of charm.

I must had went thru numerous site for my search for hotels near Russell Square(I was to go on a local tour on Contiki tours, which had to be near Russell Square).While theres no shortages of hotels, B&Bs around,the prices were way above my budget,and for most, you had to pay extra for a bath, and even more for a toilet attached!!!( Coming from a place where even the lousiest hotel has an attached toilet!) You can imagine how happy i was when i found the BA site advertising the rooms for Tavistock for US$88 for a double( i was with my partner).. Its really the best deal i had come across.... I am not going to go into details on the room conditions(can find plenty in the reviews,each with different opinions :-)) , but for what i paid for, and the going rate for a room in London(and with attached toilets mind you!, ) its a fantasic bargain.... Its great because: 1)For a first timer to London(like myself),it links directly Heathrow Airport Tube Station to the Russell Square tube station.Theres no confusion as it doesnt require one to change tube lines,or anything.Just hop on at Heathrow on the Picadallly Line, in about 45mins, you will reach Russell Square.Then its a five minute walk to the hotel. 2)Its location is really near to all the attractions in London.One can probably walk to most places, but since i was unsure, i was using the tube all the time.Its just couple of stops away from all the major tourist spots ,eg Oxford St, Big Ben..British Musuem is just around the corner.Plus its a nice quiet area Not quiet to the extent that you feel dangerous to walk the streets, but more as in its near to a few universities and hotels, theres many students, and tourists walking around... Nice when you get tired of the hustle and bustle of London.. 3)Theres a Tesco Convinence shop in front of the Russell station. No need to compare prices .They sell the cheapest beer, mineral water, snacks, etc etc anyway around ..Can stock up before returing to the hotel. 4) I cant confirm for everyone, but i managed to get checked in at 10am,I had arrived early in London and told them that i would check out very early , about 6am.The reception was very good about it,and checked me in without any fuss.I supposed i was lucky to have rooms available..probably if it was summer,i would have to wait till the standard 2pm. I wasnt able to get a late checkout though when i came back from my tour,but i guessed by then, the hotel was fully booked.But i was able to leave my bags for 50 pence a day, which was pretty reasonable. 5)Probably you guys would have found out thru their websites that the Royal National, The Imperial, Tavistock all belongs to the same chain of hotels.The Imperial probably is the most expensive, followed by the royal National , then Tavistock.not much difference in prices and quailty,but the Tavistock is a smaller hotel.Thus i believed could offer more personalised service, compared to Royal National's thousands of rooms.I had some tour companions who stayed there. Was a maze they told me. All in all, a very satisfying place to stay,and i would definitely return there when i go back to London.Hope my review helps in any small way like the way the previous reviews helped me.cheers", "Date": "March 16, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "NYC, NY", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely perfect - 150% satisfied - best deal in London\u201d", "Author": "annmarie1122", "ReviewID": "UR3193149", "Content": "Just got back last night. Stayed Feb 9-13 2005. I went back and forth with this hotel and asked A LOT of people on this site for their opinions because i wasn't sure after reading the hotel review - but i have got to say, this hotel was an unbelievable deal and I would definately stay here again (unless of course i come into a ton of money and can mindlessly blow it on a trendy boutique hotel!!) I paid 264 US, which included tax and breakfast which we never used (rather experience something differenet each day), through BA's site. The hotel has about 8 floors and probably about 40 rooms on each. We stayed in room 835 which I HIGHLY recommend. It was 100% clean, a good size and was located on the inside, facing the courtyard so there was no noise at all. The heat was not a problem at all in this room. For a hotel room in the EU this was an expected size. The room was simple and spotless and the bathroom had a tub too with hot water and great pressure!!!! Wish my tiny apartment in NYC had this kind of pressure! If you are looking for luxery this is not it. However, if you are looking for a clean room with enough space for you and a companion and and unreal location and deal, then this is the hotel for you. It is located right off the Piccadily line at the Russell Square Tube. It is a 50 minute ride on the tube from Heathrow. A one way ticket was approx. 7 pounds for 2 people. There is a lift in the Russell Square tube and about 10 stairs - not a big deal at all, of course depending on the size of your luggage, age etc. I am 30 years old and live in NYC so lugging luggage up train stairs, taking the train to the plane and small apartments are in my blood, so I felt right at home here. I just can't justify spending a lot of money on a hotel room when I literally only slept and showered there - we were never in the room - and there is SO much more to spend money on than a hotel. This was my boyfriend's first trip to western Europe and his first reaction to the room was \"wow great room, so clean, we really got a great deal.\" The staff was nice and we arrived at 10am and they let us check in early which was such a treat and so needed cause we took a 3 hour nap and were ready to roll. On our last night there (Saturday) we had gone out VERY late and got back to the hotel at 10 am!!! They let us extend out checkout until 2pm free of charge, after that you pay and they held our luggage for 2 pounds until we were ready to hit the road at 5pm. There were no toiletries in the bathroom other than soap, but I usually bring my own shampoo and conditioner anyway and I brought a \"squeegie\" wash sponge and tossed it after the trip. The only outlet was in the bedroom, none in the bathroom, which was fine. I just dried my hair in the mirror while watching the BBC. I didn't check out the other floors, but did notice that the hallway got warmer as we walked toward the elevators (our room, 835, was located at the corner end of the hotel, so maybe the lower # rooms are warmer) I have a feeling that the rooms on the higher levels may be in better condition, however, this only based on the elevator doors opening on floors 5 and 4 and me noticing the decor and doors. If you can, ask for the 8th floor and a room from 820-835. I posted pictures of the hotel that I specifically took for all of you on this site. Enjoy!!! Also, the other imperial hotels are all near by so I took a quick look at them and I would def. say I'd take the Tavistock all over again. The others (imperial, president, bedford and national) look much more rundown, and they are all located on the main street (Southampton) as opposed to a side street like Tavistock and they are more expensive and I can't imagine that they will be any better. Again, we were 150% satisfied. I have travelled a lot over the years from Iceland to Rio from Cali to Prague and this was by far the best deal. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel. Don't waste money on a room you will never be in - go out to a great dinner, see a play, splurge on some cool stuff. I feel like I got the deal of the century.

We booked a triple room with British Air for $308 each for 7 nights, which is pretty fantastic for London, especially central London! (With the obscene exchange rates, we certainly appreciated the savings in the accommodation area!) We were given a triple room (3 single beds) overlooking the other side of the hotel, so no views to speak of, but then, you're not there to look out windows, you're there to actually go outside. The room was a nice size, more than ample space to fit 3 adults with their 3 suitcases. There were 2 closets and plenty of drawer space, so we didn't have to live out of our luggage either. The room also was equipped with a TV and coffee maker. The toilet was separate from the wash area, which was very helpful. There was a tub with shower, which had fantastic pressure and was very clean. There is no hair dryer in the room, but you can get one from housekeeping for a refundable 20 pound deposit, and adapters are 3 pounds. I agree about the central heating, it could be very oppressive at night. However, nothing simpler than to open the windows, so it was dealt with quite easily. Our package came with free continental breakfast, which really was not worth it. Rolls, toast, and coffee, tea, or juice. I thought it absurd that you couldn't even have the cereals unless you paid for Full English, which was a complete rip-off. Go find the nearest non-trendy cafe or pub and get a proper English for less. The servers were very friendly though, so if you do head down to the breakfast here, you're sure to have engaging conversation! Russell Square tube station is a very short walk for the Piccadilly Line (easy transfers to the Northern and Central lines, and it takes you right to Heathrow). There is sometimes construction being done on the lifts, which are the only way to get to the lines, so sometimes the wait can be an inconvenience if there's a crowd of travellers waiting for one. If you are coming back after the tubes close, there's a night bus that drops you very close by, and other buses that run during the day along Upper Woburn Pl. (the east side of the hotel.) I had no issues walking back late at night from areas in Soho, but most people would probably not want to do that, unless you know your way around very well. :-) The hotel's surroundings are lovely; Tavistock Square and Russell Square are both tranquil green areas (so wonderful to sit there and people-watch). The area is very close to the British Museum, and if you love to walk, you can easily reach Oxford Street and other more central locations. There are also internet cafes and a post office in the area.
