I stayed at the Landmark Deira for 8 days the first week of Nov 2009. Normally i stay at 4-points but it was full due to the Grand Prix. LM was recommended by a local travel agent. I figured to try 1 night and move on if it was bad. Check in was easy. They did not hold my passport (USA). Room was clean, everything worked, nice bathroom, lots of hot water, mini bar, flat screen, extra pillows...etc..But, there is a mosque close by (5 am call to prayer if u are a light sleeper). Breakfast buffet was okay for free. Recommend get there 7 am for freshest picks. No coffee only tea tho. Room service was quick. Free newpaper every morning. The room don't have iron or kettles, but u can get an iron from the desk. The location is good for sight seeing and shopping, and taxis easy to get. A few of the drivers did not know where the hotel was so carry your hotel key card cover (it had a good map on it) or point them to the Mosque next to Al Ghuraiar Shopping Mall (worked for me) I found the staff to be very friendly and kind, BUT very limited english. I had problem when calling room service or for help, but they were quick to get someone to call back that understood english, so it all worked out. They also keep a sharp eye on anyone coming and going. For me, this was a bonus. If u are looking for a place to eat, shower, and sleep it's a good choice.

In addidtion to the breakfast room, there is one single restaurant that looked boring enough for us not to try it. Breakfast was not included in our room price, and that was just as good. We tried the breakfast on the first morning of our stay and we turned our tumbs down. Afterwards we had breakfast and all other meals outside the hotel. There is no alcohol serving in Landmark. Most of the night life is taking place in other parts of the city, and a short taxi drive will take you there. (ca 8 euros.) There is a small swimming pool on the hotel roof. We preferred the beaches of Jumeira, they can be highly recommended. Most of the reception staff behaved as if they had a bad day all the time. No smiles, no friendliness.
