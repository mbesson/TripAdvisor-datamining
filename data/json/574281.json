Everything there is very very small - room, bathroom, breakfast room, kitchen. The room in which we stayed (226) was I think 3 meters long and 2 meters wide, with the most uneven walls I ever saw in my entire life. It was so bad that the bed could not be in any way positioned to be parallel with the side walls even if it was perpendicular on the wall behind it - boggles the mind. However, it was clean and recently renovated by the looks of it and if you're not planning to spend too much time in the room it's ok. The internal court yard looks horrible - dirty and old - and you have no sun light in the room. I didn't get much rest because in the morning, at around 7, when breakfast starts, you can hear people passing on the corridor, and if you're a light sleeper you'll wake up for sure. I think it's worse if you stay on the first floor - where the reception is - or near the sliding door from floor 2 - which I could hear even from a long distance away. Breakfast is very very poor - 2 kind of cereals, bread, butter and some kind of jelly they try to pass as being jam - don't pay for it. The room where it's served is very small and dark. Make sure you have ENOUGH CASH with you. You'll need to pay a fee for visiting Rome which is 2 euros/person/day and they don't accept credit card for that. Also some restaurants don't accept credit card, so make sure you ask first. But, as I was saying, the location is excellent, You're 1-2 kilometers away from the most well known tourist attractions - Fontana di Trevi, Colosseum, Bocca Della Verit\u00e0, etc. Even if I was horrified when I first entered the hotel and the room, I think I'd go back for 2-3 more days - go figure that out :) Rome is fabulous!", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel!\u201d", "Author": "StarbucksFreak25", "ReviewID": "UR124465125", "Content": "The hotel located close to termini station (5 min walk) and to the historical city center (10-15 min walk).

Breakfast consisted only of coffee and bread. No cheese or ham as they show in the pictures. The room was clean and the bath is large enough, but the door did not close properly and with a single push opens despite it is in theory locked. There is a safe box in the room but they charge you extra if you want to use it (which can be much more importart if the door can't be closed). They also charge 15 Euros more to use the air conditioning even if it is only for a while (the room was very warm during the evening and it was september). The personeel that is there during the evenings is very friendly, but everything changes with the people who are there during the day. Beware also if you get a room on the same floor as the reception as you will be constantly awaken with everything that happens out there, Finally they also take their toll on your vacation time by insisting that you get cash to pay all your bill instead of by credit card (any card, not even the same credit card you used to book and guarantee your stay) So they had us finding a way to call our bank abroad to see if we could withdraw a larger amount. By the end it was not possible to get that amout of cash specially as we were leaving back to the US that afternoon. and then, somehow, they finally decided to accept our credit card. However we had a hetic morning trying to get this sorted out instead of enjoying our last day of vacations in Rome. For what other travellers told me at the airport it is very common that hotels in Rome insist at the very last moment that you pay in cash, may be as a means to avoid paying taxes. I'm not sure if this is true but it really leaves you a bitter aftertaste of your holidays as they get very pushy and unfriendly with this issue.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beersheba, Israel", "Title": "\u201cIt's a 3 star hotel, and that's what it does best.\u201d", "Author": "Cynicoren", "ReviewID": "UR115023531", "Content": "No major complaints, as there are also no major benefits to this hotel, but its location. The room (118) was cleaned each day. It was a very small room, with a small flat screen TV, an old safe inside the wall, restroom and a shower and even a bidet. The sink had a breaking signs on it, but still was whole. The staff were very friendly and nice, and attended our needs pretty fast (a bulb that went off was quickly replaced). On the other hand, we had a few problems with them - First of all, they were pretty misinformed. I asked about the \"Angels and Demons tour\", and I was told that it stopped a few years ago. 2 days later (too late for us) , I found out that it is still running. I asked about the train to the airport and I was told the wrong times. The other problem was, that when living, we wanted to pay with a credit card ( we ordered with a CC in advance from Hotels.com ), and it took more than 10 minutes, because the reader wasn't attached, and they had trouble connecting it. The year is 2011, it's not supposed to happen. The location as was said before, is really great - a few (10-20) minutes walk from major sites, and also close to bus lines 40 and 64 that travel to the Vatican, and to the underground that goes to Piazza del Popolo. All in all, it's ok, and I would go back there, just don't expect too much. -We didn't have breakfast and didn't want the AC (on pay).

The hotel looked to have been totally refurbished for this season, the room could not be faulted, Fridge, TV (you'll never need it), stand up Shower etc in spotless bathroom.

The room was basic, tiled floor, white walls, but could not be faulted. plenty of wardrobe draws etc. My boyfriend and I found the hotel from the station no problem, its far enough away from Termini that you need never know its there but close enough for the trudge home with the cases (ten min walk, and off Via Nacional) All the main sights are within walking distance, (trevi fountain 5-10 minute walk) but for anything on the west bank of the Tiber (St Peter's etc) an open top bus ticket is probably your best bet, about \u20ac16 for a 24 hr pass on the 110 trambus from the station all day. Theres no getting away from the fact that Rome is a noisy place, a real 24 hr city and with the windows open you will be awoken once or twice, but with all the walking we did it didn't keep us awake long! One point to note was there is a slightly unusual practice (to me anyway) whereby the room keys are deposited behind the reception desk when the guest leaves the hotel. The reception is open 24 hrs, and you will be buzzed in on the intercom, the hotel occupies the first and second floors (not the ground) but there is a lift.

The Elide was the low point on my trip, and the only positive about it was that everywhere else seemed great in comparison. The room was clean enough, and it DID have its own bathroom. But... I was placed in the ST room. This room was so small that it would not have fitted a double bed. I could sit on the bed with my back against one wall, and easily rest my feet on the opposite wall. There was a table, but this was the only place I could place my luggage, so essentially the room was taken up with a single bed, my single bag, and the bar fridge with the TV sitting on it. There WERE a set of draws in the room, but they sat under the table, with no room to roll them out for use. Kinda pointless. There were pipes running from the window into the bathroom, where I discovered a large water heater taking up so much room that you could not sit on the toilet normally. This water heater (I can only assume that is what it was!) would click on and off throughout the night and hum loudly enough as it did so that I would shut the bathroom door to try to muffle the noise. The TV had a remote control that was A) covered in something, and B) not in any way compatible with the TV. It wasn't even the same brand! Luckily the room was so small that the TV was rarely out of arms reach. The hotel lobby is on the 1st floor, so each time you want to enter the hotel you have to buzz up and wait to be buzzed in. The staff in the hotel were mixed. I asked one to recommend a place to eat and a laundromat, and he obliged and provided a map. The other just looked blankly at me, and tried to add mystery 'snacks from the mini bar' to my bill when I went to pay. The window opened up into a dirty.. courtyard? There was constant noise from this area, including construction noise. If you angled yourself at the bottom of the window and look up as high as you can, it is just possible to see if there is blue skies or not. I wanted to shut the windows at night to reduce the noise, but the heat of the water-heater meant that this was not feasible.
