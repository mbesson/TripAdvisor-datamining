I did check reviews and now I am surprised why they are all good. The truth is, this is a hotel, I wanted to leave the moment I checked in. My room #2 in the basement seemed dirty and ran down. I even bought sandals to walk around. I didn't have towels, got them after asking but only one. On 2nd night water from bathroom on top was dripping and flooding my own bathroom. I ask to be changed, but it wasn't possible. I had to shower in another used bathroom, from where a guest just left! Showers are tiny, you really cannot bend in there! Poor furniture, burned out lights, bad odors, when bathroom of room above was being used. It was also very loud, you could here other guests come & go, using bathrooms, showers, etc. specially those living above my room. Disgusting view to an abandoned indoor patio, from a window. I kept all the time the curtain closed. Location was fine, and I was glad though to have free WiFi as well as an old fridge and microwave. Because of the flooding a guy at reception (I think manager) offered me they would reimburse a night, which didn't happen. Staff was friendly and nice, but at the end I was very happy to leave and do not recommend this hotel.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Piran, Slovenia", "Title": "\u201cA good one\u201d", "Author": "Birikkina", "ReviewID": "UR125146057", "Content": "4 ladies, 5 nights, january 2012 Room on the top (4th floor) 2 king size beds and 2 single, small fridge, small kitchen with microwave and tea maker. Four cups and 3 dishes - better to buy it plastic in Sainsbury's (2 mins away) as you don't have any detergent. Enough space, two windows, small tv (as someone said, it was the size of an iPod). There is absolutely no space in the bathroom (even the sink is that little one you have no space to wash your hands), so you have to leave all your beauty-case & co. in the room. Great location, calm area, bus nr 74 (bus stop one block away, on Cromwell street) takes you directly to the center (Victoria, Picadilly..). Use Oyster! When we were there they were fixing the sewerage so we had some toilet problems, now it should probablly be ok. The stuff is great, they are reeeeeally helpful and kind. Overall: low budget + good location + great transfer connections + everything you need around the corner + nice stuff = We'll be back :) ..after all, you don't go to London to cook and watch tv.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa", "Title": "\u201cClean, very quiet, pleasant surroundings, great value for money\u201d", "Author": "A W", "ReviewID": "UR124806998", "Content": "Positive: - Location. Pleasant surroundings, tube station with little shops, pubs and restaurants nearby only a 3 minute walk away. Direct transfer connections to Victoria and Piccadilly Circus either by tube or by bus (bus station is also only a 2 minute walk away). Supermarket (Sainsbury's) only 2-3 minutes from the hotel. - Cleanliness. Both the room and especially the bathroom were surprisingly clean! - Friendly staff - Our room (and I think most others) was the only one on the floor and was oriented towards a backyard, it was really really quiet at night! Neutral-Negative: - The room was really small, and actually completely filled out by the bed; no wardrobe, just a crooked commode (we were unable to open the drawers) -The \"fully equipped kitchen\" in fact consisted of a water kettle and 2 cups. I think there is 1 family room with a kitchen, but the other rooms clearly don't have any. There is also no shared kitchen. - The bathroom was seperated from the bedroom only by a ramshackle folding door. ALL IN ALL: Still, great value for money. It's still a great hostel and we'd definitely come back.", "Date": "February 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hangzhou, China", "Title": "\u201cVery good for the money\u201d", "Author": "Mikoraud", "ReviewID": "UR124333747", "Content": "Stayed at the hotel for four nights in the beginning of February 2012, averaged 40GBP a night.

Arrived about 9pm at night and admittedly it didnt look great, reception shabby, quite dingy really but I thought ok, no problem, I'm a seasoned traveller, I can deal with this. But suddenly found I couldnt, when I was shown into a room that was NOT a proper room, just behind the reception area, and I MEAN just sharing a thin wall with \"reception\" which was a desk with a bloke behind it all night! The room was extremely dingy, \"bathroom\" a joke, shower a mess...ok everything looked \"clean\" but the state of repair was appalling...broken tiles and a huge shower caddy thing to one side of the shower ON THE FLOOR that really shouldn't have been there, a small wash hand basin, taps almost hanging off.. The bed was basic sheet and stupid looking fleece throw over it. Hello? Whats that all about?? Reception just through a thin wall..I could hear the bloke moving stuff around all night! It seemed like he was moving boxes around the floor, even at 3.40 am. I really didnt feel comfortable or safe as a single traveller. Next day I railed up AT 7.30 am, saw the manager EVENTUALLY at 10am who offered a room on the 3rd floor but it was too late for me, i couldnt wait to see the back of the place. Had to fight for a refund of my remaining 3 nights, as for some reason this hotel asks for the money upfront PLUS a suspicious credit card charge, which my booking site didn't highlight. All in all, a lucky escape. Never again. Wouldn't recommend this \"hotel\" to anyone. Now I'm not a picky traveller, I can stay most places if the price is right...well used to staying in cities all over the world on my own, but this has to be the worst experience I've ever had.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location,excellent stuff,clean room,good price,100% satisfaction!\u201d", "Author": "Nikolai1984", "ReviewID": "UR123222529", "Content": "Me and my wife stayed at this hotel in December 2011,very good location,we needed help about what sites is best to visit in the city and the stuff was very helpful,explained to us step by step how and where to go,it's maked our stay excellent,we did the maximum in our 5 days that we been at the hotel.The room was very clean,and we will stay in this hotel next time that we will be in London.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cValue for money budget hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "Amanda G", "ReviewID": "UR123181101", "Content": "My friend and I have just returned from a 2 night break at this hotel.

No elevator, we stayed at the 4th floor, very narrow staircase and some steps are a little lose, be careful. VERY POOR WIFI INTERNET! Do not expect it to work, only way for me to access the wifi was to walk down the stairs and stand next to check in counter. Very Irritating! They state that they have WIFI, do not expect it to work.
