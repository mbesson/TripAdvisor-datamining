Other reviewers have written long narratives so I'll cut to the high points: Good: -- Clean -- Fair location (about 4 blocks from Michigan) -- Comfortable bed -- Relatively low cost -- Free WiFi Bad: -- Small rooms as noted (about half the size of a typical two queen, or a bit smaller) -- Sink slow-running and shallow (wind up dipping your hands in the pool of runoff water) -- Low price tends to attract obnoxious younger guests (several groups of drunk kids who looked barely old enough to be drinking in the first place) -- Thin walls so you can easily hear said neighbors running through the halls or yelling at 2 am -- $42 parking charge I chose Hotel Felix for a short stay because of the low listed price given the location, but the parking charge cuts down on the difference between other hotels in the area. The room size didn't bother me since (as another reviewer said) I didn't come here to stay in my room, but don't fool yourself -- you're not getting a luxury hotel at a bargain price. The management seems to put a lot of effort into things that don't really affect the quality of the stay -- LEED certification (gets them a tax break but not clear what it does for the customer), trendy wallpaper and mirrors, and the amusing management response to *every comment* on the thread, transparently fluffing themselves and attempting to defuse any criticism, even if legitimate. Dear management, it's great that you're reviewing feedback, but if you really care about your customers, show them by taking care of them while they're staying with you. In sum, it's a fair option for one person or a couple who just need a place to crash, especially if you're on a budget, but next time I'll pay the difference for more space and attention.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rocktown ,il", "Title": "\u201cOMG\u201d", "Author": "Troy A", "ReviewID": "UR125477314", "Content": "I booked thru priceline,I am sorry to say this isnt a 4 star hotel!. 1st off They put us on the 12th floor my wife has a problem with heights and elevators.(what they knew about).

I had seen a young family in the lobby when I was checking in, so I was curious how the stay worked out for them...seems to me that there's a definite 2-person max per room, regardless of your size. The bathroom was very nice, and the shampoos/soaps smelled great. Very comfortable bed, and because the rooms are small, the temperature can be adjusted within minutes! I stayed two nights, and the cleaning staff were great about getting to work while I was gone for the day: they noticed that I had used a restaurant's styrofoam cup (Portillos!) to drink water from, so provided me with extra hotel cups in the bathroom, which I thought was very thoughtful...especially since my water had been tasting like a strawberry shake. They were also kind enough to leave the desk cleared (I had removed all of the hotel materials so that I could get some work done). Overall, I had a great experience at this hotel. The staff is super friendly, the accommodations are comfortable, the free coffee in the lobby 7-10am is a nice touch, and I got a great deal on Priceline.

I Pricelined a 4-star hotel and was booked at Hotel Felix for two nights. I am used to getting chain hotels, and was excited to try a new hotel. I immediately called the hotel upon booking to request a room with two beds as I was traveling with my aunt one night and my college roomies the next. I was disappointed when informed that I was booked in a room with one queen bed -was not really accommodations for two in my opinion. I was told by the hotel that they were also nearly sold out of rooms with two beds, but I could get one of someone canceled the day we checked in. I was annoyed with both Priceline and the hotel. I called the hotel the morning I checked in to make sure there would be two beds and to my relief they could honor the request! Overall, I felt the hotel was a good value for the $76/night I got on Priceline, but I would not have paid the $138 going rate for the double room. There are too many other great hotels in Chicago! Hotel Felix is very nice, but not in the 4-star category with properties like Intercontinental, Westin, or W. The lobby was one of my fave parts of the hotel. It was very modern and cozy, had a fabulous fireplace, and smelled amazing (maybe from spa on 2nd floor?) The lobbyroom bar was fun and convenient with the freezing temps outside! The room (417) was small, but much better than what I was expecting after reading reviews. The beds were fantastic - comfy and great headboards. The decor was simple and modern. The room was very clean, but the painters in the last remodel should have used some painters tape as there was paint on sides of some furniture. The closet was tiny, but had a safe and plenty of room to hang our coats. The bathroom was fine. We could have used a little more space for our toiletries. Also, the water pressure in the shower was not great, but expected since a green hotel. The bath products were great - H2O - and they were happy to provide extra upon request. The staff was pleasant and accomodating once we got to the hotel. The location was great -to we walked to the theater, great restaurants and Michigan Ave. no problem! In summary, I would probably only stay here again if I Pricelined and was only traveling with my husband. It would have been much less stressful to spend a bit more and book at a hotel that can guarantee two beds. Also, while Hotel Felix is very nice, I think Priceline needs to reduce it to a 3-star property, maybe 3.5-star!

We do have favorites, but that's a separate review. On this one friday night, we decided for a last minute shot at a weekend night in Downtown Chicago. The hotel rates in the city, because of a convention and of course last minute booking, were all fairly pricey, so we decided to try \"Priceline\". We get a room at the \"Hotel Felix\". Lucky us......or not! I do a little web research, and find that a woman was murdered there a few months back, by some disgruntled boyfriend or other. I don't tell my girlfriend this, because of the obvious reaction she may have. But then I figure that murders probably happen a lot of hotels, and I'm just not in the \"Hotel Murder\" email list. So here we go. Check-in at 5pm on Friday, November 11. The lobby is small but seems to have charm. Up to the counter, where two gentleman are at the reservation desk. We stood there for 3 minutes until one of them finally looks up and says, \"Yes?\". Apparently a \"Welcome to the Hotel Felix, how can we help you?\", is too old school for this modern hotel. There probably is more charm at a methadone clinic check-in. Let's move on. You'll need your key card to get into the elevator, I assume to keep the riffraff out or perhaps a repeat offender. Whatever. Now if you read the reviews, you'll hear about the small rooms. You have to know that small typically might mean no separate sitting room or couch area. Small here means that there was 18\" between the end of the bed and the tv dresser cabinet. Getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, left me with bruises. If you're not small people, be aware of this. Not even a real closet. The bathroom? The room seemed to be slightly larger than a \"Porta-Potty\". Now please understand that room was clean, and the tv, lights and water all worked. But at $ 145.00 a night for this room, you can only go to this room to sleep. You have a bed and a bathroom, in a room the size of your red-headed kid's bedroom. It really should be classified a hostile, not a boutique Chicago hotel room. Enough of the room. We decide to have an evening cocktail at the lobby bar. It's about 9:30pm on this Friday night. The lobby bar seats about 10 people, and the lounge area at least 25, so looks comfy. Drinks were fine, but that's where the evening goes south. Apparently employees are welcome at the bar on their day off. On this night, an off work bartender was in with a friend at the end of the bar. The bartender, employee & friend were trading stories all night while drinking. (Not the actual bartender). Them being loud and ruining the dynamic of the room & bar would have been one thing, but every other word out of this loud group was, \"F*#K\". To the point of being so uncomfortable, that the couple next to us got up and left. We kept on trying to ignore it while finishing our glass of wine. Now you may ask, \"Why didn't you just get up and leave?\" We kept thinking that the front desk or a manager would intervene and stop the drunkin \"F\" bombs being used for every other word. The lobby desk is within ear shot of the bar and lounge, and I guess they are just used to it, and didn't seem to be bothered at all by it. I also have to say that we are in are late 40's, and by no means prude or uppity. I am also in the restaurant business, so loud customers and bar patrons, from time to time, are part of the business. You know where to the draw the line with a loud really good customer, and a one time drunk & rude customer. But to have a guy at the bar loud and lewd, that's an employee of the hotel? Totally un-exceptable! This review has been brewing for almost two months, and I finally thought it was time to write this. I don't like to write bad reviews, I do a lot of research on places that I stay and love to write a review on a great experience that I can share with others. This stay was just not right from start to finish. I know we overpaid because of how busy the city was that night, but a guest experience that was so poor, you feel almost ripped off. With that being said, if you can get this room for $ 49.00 a night, by all means stay because it's close to shopping. Don't plan on relaxing in your room, just stay out shopping, eating and drinking, then hope that you can just pass out in your bed from exhaustion!

But cliches are OK when they work. Felix is located @ Clark and Huron in the River North area of downtown Chicago, which is close to all of the retail/touristy bustle (and generic-ness) of N. Michigan Avenue but removed enough to have its own laid-back feel. The lobby is small, dark and tech-chic. The front desk staff is friendly without being effusive, and efficient. There are only 3 elevators to wisk you to your room, but this was never a problem during my stay. As I mentioned, the rooms are very cozy, but not uncomfortably so. My queen single had a wall-mounted flat-screen television with a decent channel selection, a (too) small work desk and a lounge chair. The bed was a little high off the floor but extremely comfortable - the kind you don't want to get out of in the morning. The room's closet was essentially an indentation in the wall with a sliding curtain to cover it. The bathroom was compact, but with well-utilized space, and continued the high-tech chic look of the hotel and rooms. Much to my delight, it featured a walk-in shower with a raining shower head and excellent pressure. H2O bath products and big fluffy towels didn't hurt the cause either. WiFi and wired internet access were free throughout the hotel. In addition, a complimentary business center with two computers for guest use is accessible 24/7 with your room key. Free coffee (of good quality) is available in the morning at the bar just off the lobby. I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but the menu looked good. I love staying in the River North area, away from the annoying hordes of slow-moving tourists and people clutching shopping bags in the immediate Mag Mile vicinity.

While we did not put the \"save water\" card on our pillow indicating we wanted the sheets/towels changed, they still changed them away. Only when I told housekeeping that we didn't need anything, did they not change our towels and sheets for the day. As far as their Eco-friendly Sundair products, thankfully I brought my own shampoo and soap because the ingredients in these products I guess might not hurt the Earth, but they are not so good for your body with chemicals and dyes that are known to cause cancer - and while you don't drink the stuff, our skin absorbs anything we touch/use. I would think that if they are trying to be different from the other hotels in the area, they might offer organic, or natural products without dyes and ingredients that you need a dictionary to understand. Their restaurant, Elate, announces that they are proud to promote local and organic products whenever possible. From what I recall, there were (3) organic choices available from their entire breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner menu. If you are looking for organic food, you can get this much, if not more, at many other restaurants in downtown Chicago. We did eat breakfast one morning and had the one organic choice which was very good and the service was exceptional. Local products does not mean organic and chemicals more than likely are used. They also didn't offer any free range meats or eggs if they are trying to promote themselves as using healthy food. IN GENERAL: VERY CLEAN! FRIENDLY AND ACCOMMODATING STAFF - INSIDE AND OUT. Comfortable, small lobby. Small hotel bar. As far as the room in general - I guess you can say it is a masterpiece of organization in a small space. The room we were in was small, and the closet almost non-existant. If you are traveling alone, not a big deal, but as a couple trying to hang all of our clothing we had to layer outfit over outfit on I think 5 hangers in a small cubbyhole. There are no dressers per say, the bed is a platform bed with 3 drawers, which is fine, except the walking space in-between the drawer handles and the chair to the desk was about 2 feet. There are 2 night stands, each with a small drawer. The bathroom was large enough, the only thing that was \"strange\" was the bathroom sink. Having a modern flare, the faucet was so low to the ceramic bowl you could hardly get your hands underneath to get the water, squeezing in a washcloth. There was also no counter space to put out a bathroom travel case, etc. The shower was large with a great showerhead. Again, everything was very clean. Comfortable mattress! Our stay was for 4 nights and by then you get used to passing each other in a small space. Since I worked in the hotel for 2 of those days, I felt closed in. But, if you are basically using your room to just sleep while you enjoy the sights of Chicago, then not a huge deal. Good sized TV screen if you are into TV. Would we stay here again?

Aside from the very small rooms, the decor of the hotel is very contemporary yet warm, and if you don't plan on staying in your room for very long, you shouldn't miss the space. Basically, it's a very cosy place to crash, but you may go mad if you stay in the room for any length of time. The services in the hotel were about average. A receptionist greeted me when I first entered the hotel, but there were several times when I walked into the building or went downstairs to find nobody at the front desk, yet within 20 minutes I would see three people standing there waiting for something to do. Upon check-in I requested a room with two beds to replace the single full bed (I was expecting at least a single queen in a luxury boutique hotel), and I was placed on a \"wait list\" for Sunday evening when several rooms opened up. This request never materialized and the list never really existed. It was unfortunate, but not the end of the world. Sleep quality was very nice--Hotel Felix's beds rank up there with the W, Westin, and the higher-end Marriott hotels, but the standard single bed is only a queen. Again, not the end of the world, but I was definitely expecting a queen or king-sized bed for the price. The A/C was very, very loud, and it would turn on and off frequently--literally within a minute of turning on, it would turn off, then back on, and this repeated over and over. At one point it sounded like an Australian didgeridoo, so that might help you or it might drive you crazy--either way, the A/C was loud. The rooms were very clean--the white sheets looked brand new and the white surfaces throughout the room were immaculate. This may be due to the fact that the rooms were so small that they were easy to clean, but the rooms were very clean at check-in. However, we had a qualm we had was with the shower and its curtain. The standing shower reminded me of a dorm room shower--very plain and plastic--the curtain barely reached the ground, and it wasn't wide enough for the shower; so water splattered all over the bathroom with every use. Wall, door and the and floor were covered with water, so things were slippery and we needed extra towels to wipe the place down after use. The very odd design is mentioned by other reviewers, so you would think they would fix this (especially with the \"eco-friendly\" motif they market). The location was relative to your needs in the city. We were a few blocks from the Brown/Red CTA lines and Michigan Avenue was just a few blocks away, which came in handy when we wanted to go north to Old Town and Lincoln Park or to go shopping. The hotel feels a little off the beaten path, but it was also very quiet at night and still near many great local restaurants, bars and other hotspots. The blue line train was a several-block hike, so if you prefer to use mass transit to and from O'Hare (to maintain the eco-friendly motif), you'll also burn several extra calories lugging your baggage up and down the street. Other notes: housekeeping left our room open with the security bar propping it open until we returned home one evening. The front desk offered 30 dollars in food credit at the hotel restaurant, Elate (where entrees start at 20 dollars a plate), so we opted for breakfast and went about 3 dollars over the credit. Still, after requesting a call from a manager, I received nothing, and there was no one available to talk to at check-out. Late check-out was set for 1 pm and they wouldn't budge--Starwood properties generally offers 3pm checkouts for guests. Again, I would expect this out of a motel or lower-end hotel, but generally nicer properties bend over backwards for guests. Our experience was that of a cheap chain hotel rather than an \"eco-friendly luxury boutique\"", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cWe should have stayed home\u201d", "Author": "Maureen T", "ReviewID": "UR119161395", "Content": "We checked in to a room that was \"maybe\" 100 square feet with one full size bed...for my husband, myself and my teen daughter.

The only real drawbacks to the hotel (typical of many boutiques) is that our room (including the closet) was extremely small. Furthermore, there were no minibars or refrigerators in our room. Such would be helpful to add for guests. Finally, when we called downstairs to request the front desk to print our boarding pass whn checking out, the desk clerk said they were all too \"busy\", and somewhat abruptly said we should \"handle it ourselves\" in the lobby area at a computer terminal. When we arrived downstairs a few minutes later to check out and also print our boarding pass, we saw three people at the front desk - and none looked particularly busy!

I am a smaller person so maybe it doesn't bother me as much. However, rooms look great, very clean, and the amenities look modern and works well. I really enjoy the rooms that I have gotten there so far. Service is somewhat hit or miss. Most of the time, I get great service. Sometimes, I get a person that seems a bit impersonal. I don't usually require much in terms of service but when I do, the staff at Hotel Felix has been helpful. In terms of location, it works great for me. If you arrive late, there is a good pub (Kerryman) close by. You just cross the street for a beer and chicken curry. That usually gets me through until the next day. It is also close to the hard rock and more importantly, it is just 6 blocks from one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, Xoco. Runned by Top Chef Masters, Rick Bayliss, Xoco is his \"value\" restaurant. If you want to try his other higher end restaurants, they are next to each other.

Rooms are super-duper small, I mean SMALL. There is no closet in which to put your clothing. You must hang your clothes in a small space provided to do that, only protected by a curtain. Tthe room has a safe box, a 42 inch flat screen TV, clock radio. No cofee maker in the room. The bathroom is also small, however; compared to the room, its size is not too bad. Imagine if you could fit the bathroom in the actual room, it would fit only about four times, that is how small the rooms are. There is about three to four feet MAX, between the bed and the walls on either side of the room, that is it. Toiletries are H2O products. Beds are comfortable, but the pillows are HORRIBLE, small and uneven. I advise you to travel with your own pillow from home, if neck pain is something you don't want to deal with during your vacation. Staff are nice and extremely helpful . If you need a taxi or directions to go to places, they are happy to help. Complimentary coffee is provided in the mornings. After a certain time they do not refill the kettles. So make sure you go early. There is a small bar in the lobby that serves drinks until about midnight or a bit later, however if you are still thirsty for more, there is a bar across the street from the hotel which is open until later. Parking!!!a luxury in the city of Chicago. The hotel charges $45.00 for parking per night, with in and out privileges, something no too many parking places offer in the city. There is a parking lot one block west of the hotel and it is possible to park there for $12.00 all day, no in and out, though. No car is needed in the city, there are plenty of cabs, and the public transportation is excellent .

Let me tell you that I could not have been more satisfied with the Hotel Felix! It was perfect for my wife and me. Sure the rooms are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153large\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, but they are also not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tiny\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

I would have killed for this room last time I was in New York City! The real reason that this hotel gets a bad rap is the fact that \u00e2\u20ac\u0153low-ball\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bidders think that they are going to find a room smack dab in the middle of Michigan Ave. for $75 to $100. Well guess what, it isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t going to happen! The Hotel Felix is 5 blocks off of Michigan Ave. Once bidders realize this, they begin to pout and blame Priceline. They secretly wish that they had made a higher bid. Priceline\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s maps are not misleading. Deal with it! That is the gamble you take for playing this game. In the last year alone, I have stayed at the Four Seasons Maui, the Ritz Carlton Naples (Florida), and many quality hotels in between. Without question, the Hotel Felix has the best bed! Hands down!

The positives: We got there an hour before check-in but they had our rooms ready and service was quick. We found the hotel to be clean and it seems that it was recently renovated and decorated nicely. The beds and pillows were very comfortable, definitely above average. Flat screen TV's with a lot of channels to choose from. The bathrooms were normal size with a spacious shower. The locations is good, just a few blocks west of Michigan Avenue and close to the center of the Magnificent Mile so you can head either direction (north/south) for various restaurants, etc. Wireless internet is available at no charge and they have a nice lounge area in the lobby. The negatives: Smaller rooms (at least for us). I'd say we have an average bedroom and this was smaller than that. There is space to walk on either side of the queen bed but there would not be room for any furniture such as a dresser. Very little room for storing anything. They do have ice and snack machines but I did not notice a beverage vending machine. The smaller rooms is what kept me from giving it a higher rating than 3. Bottom line: I would stay here again with a discounted price such as from Priceline unless we planned to spend a lot of time in the room. Perhaps bigger rooms can be requested.

The first thing people will state or complain about is the size of the rooms being too small. Ok, this is a Boutique hotel that utilizes 100% of the space, how many times are you going to use the giant couch chair and dinner table you will find in other hotels. The closest is equipped with a safe but can only handle about 6 hanging items, but there is storage under the bed. So unless you plan on partying in your room then the room was quite \"cozy\" and well suited for couples or people traveling on business. We were right next to the elevator (501) and I thought it was going to be extremely noisy, but you don't even hear the elevators as it is situated in front of the bathroom and there is about a 10' hallway to get into your room, I doubt that all the rooms were like this just the ones next to the eleveators. To those people who say they only have 18\" between the wall and the bed is completely false, there is a good 24-30\" on the side closest to the wall and about 4 feet on the other side. If you are staying for business they have a little table and chair that you can hook up your laptop too. The bathroom has a sink and a shower stall (Which is big enough for at least 4 people). There isn't any room on the sink counter to put your toiletries but there is a shelf on the wall above the toilet where you can put these items. The hotel is located 4 blocks west of Michigan Ave and about 1 mile from water tower places, and about 1.5 miles from Navy Pier, with numerous of places to eat. There is a Wal-Greens down Clark (1 Block South) in case you have need for a drug store and there is McDonald's within walking distance 5 minutes there and back to the hotel. There is a lot of good restaurants West on Huron street, if you like Italian I suggest Scoozi! There is Fogo Da Cho around the corner from the hotel as well..... Amazing (Pricey) if you go there you should go at lunch time all the same food and about 20 dollars less a plate, plust it isn't as crowded as it would be during the dinner rush. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the curb side attendant would always ask if you needed a cab and would hail one for you if you do. Would stay here again in a Hear Beat.

The location worked out quite well. It was nice to be off the beaten path of Michigan Avenue, yet still close enough to it. The area is surrounded by restaurants, lounges and bars. Portillo's was a few blocks away, for the infamous Chicago hot dog experience. There was also a Walgreens, a 7-11 and a liquor store all blocks or steps from the hotel. We had a room with a queen bed, and it was not much different in size from the rooms that we are used to getting in NYC. Small, but not suffocating. If you are major shopper or heavy packer, you might have some troubles with storage (the closet really is a bar with four hangers and a curtain). The H20 toiletries were great, and were continuously well stocked by our room attendants. I also applaud the hotel's environmental initiatives. It was great to have separate garbage and recycling bins in the room. And now for the negatives. I guess this might be a four star hotel based on amenities alone. I dealt with three separate people at the front desk during our stay. One to ask about storing our baggage, one to check in and one to check out. I know first hand that customer service can be a tough job, but the customer experience at a hotel is paramount. It makes or breaks your business. A simple smile would have helped. I disregarded it the first time, and we checked our bags with the bellhops who were all extremely friendly in contrast. The second person checking us in was probably the same person that people on here are referring to as 'condescending'. Perhaps without meaning to be, but regardless. He made no eye contact. It was as if he was reading the available amenities off a script. No smile, no welcome, no nothing. Like I said, I get that customers at times can be difficult, but all I said was \"just wondering if we would be able to check in\", and nothing else. I wasn't complaining or asking for a particular room, etc. The third and final person we dealt with at check out did greet me with a smile, and I finally felt like I was not bothering someone. On to the room. We got a lower level floor facing the street. Street noise would definitely be a problem for some, so beware light sleepers! We could hear the live jazz from the main floor restaurant on the weekend evenings, but that was actually quite nice. The main issue for us was not so much the size or the room, or the shallow sink, but the air conditioner. By the second night we would turn the temperature low for the hour or so before bed and then turn it off the for the entire night. You could hear the thing loud and clear from the hallway. I am not a light sleeper, but this was even too noisy for me! We didn't bother mentioning it figuring all rooms would be similar. Not sure if that is the case. The bed was comfortable. The small pillows were a little weird. I guess they are contemporary, but they were a little strange. Would I pay to stay here again by choice? I don't know. I would probably try something else next time. I think Hotel Felix has the potential to be a fantastic hotel, if it could just work out some essential kinks!", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Francisville, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cWould NEVER stay again!\u201d", "Author": "Blondiegal02", "ReviewID": "UR115466396", "Content": "Went to Chicago and found this hotel for a good price and good location-about 6 blocks off the Magnificent Mile.

People are staying at a fantastic address in Chicago in an exciting neighborhood\u00e2\u20ac\u201d(btw, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a former Chicagoan: this is the neighborhood and it even boasts a Whole Foods a block and a half away). And they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re complaining? Location, location, location. You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re central to everywhere you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d want to be in Chicago. And people are paying between $50-100 a night and complaining? That wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good enough for them? Let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get real: Hotel Felix has tons of charm; and , if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re traveling on business or solo for whatever reason, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an ideal place to stay. Yes: the room is small; yes, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tiny by American standards. But it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s actually perfectly fine (if a tad claustrophobic) for 1 person. And the room is incredibly nicely appointed: nice toiletries and sink in the bathroom (cosmetics were the H20 brand, which is very nice), tasteful fixtures, great HD flat-screens in room, free wireless, nice amenities, no coffee machine in rooms but complimentary coffee in lobby in AM. So... you have to get dressed and go get it. Tragic, right? Clean, sleek lines, eco-friendly... and is it really such a big deal that there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not a tub? I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather have a huge spider showerhead with plenty of hot water, which is exactly what I got... And people were complaining that the sink was shallow? And this was a problem because...? That actually was an eco-friendly touch. So, for business people: it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comfortable and modern, but you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have much of a workspace. (Honestly, my next stop for a Clarion chain hotel and it was 3x the size and had a huge desk.) I would compare this hotel more to Japan than to Europe: small, but very efficient. Or imagine picking up a copy of Architectural Digest or something and seeing how someone managed to do a fab apartment in 15 square meters.... This is what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re talking about. All that said... Yes: there are some issues. I see that the General Manager frequently responds to guest feedback and seems quite well-intentioned. Reasonable can disagree, of course, but I promise you: these rooms are not \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cozy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd: they are tiny and cramped. Coziness at least implies a nice lounge chair, an armchair. In this very small space where I banged into the bed a couple of times, there is no room for a real chair in which to sit comfortable. And reviewers are right about the lack of closet space. If you Priceline this hotel (as I did)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand I was thrilled to be in this neighborhood for $150 per night\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthen I do think that these small rooms do not in fact accommodate 2 adults: in my humble opinion, 2 adults need 2 chairs and there is not enough room for 2 chairs in the space provided. I suspect I paid on the high end for Priceline... then again, I was on the 10th floor. Americans always want larger than life: but I am 5\u00e2\u20ac\u21222\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the bed was the right size for me. Also, the ventilation is problematic because of the size of the room and the quality of the equipment/hardware: curiously, there is no exhaust or ventilation in the bathroom, which makes that room hot and musty. More troublesome\u00e2\u20ac\u201desp. if anyone in your party happens to be bald: there is no way to avoid having that fan-forced air of either A/C or heat blowing directly on your head while you sleep, which is pretty unpleasant. My husband would not have tolerated this. (The upside is that this is a room in which you can actually open a window: but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s downtown Chicago, so you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re unlikely to sleep with it open. And plastic glasses instead glassware? Ice water in a plastic cup of the sort that they use at keg parties? Reviewers are also correct that housekeeping seems a bit stingy about replacing used products (probably the eco-friendly thing)... And it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also true: dust and crud on the marble tables goes unchecked: the coffee stains look like part of the marble. Not 4 stars. Staff is lovely and accommodating and friendly: everyone that works cabs, bell caps, etc: Julian, Benjamin, and another one who was just as fabulous but I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t catch his name. And this will sound weird, but they seem to hire extremely... for want of a better word... \u00e2\u20ac\u0153beautiful people.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Everybody that works there looks like a model! Otherwise, sorry to say that, for as much charm and convenience as the place had, I think that Americans expect space in a 4-star hotel: so I do agree with those Priceline customers who think 3 stars max is the appropriate rating. I feel sorry for those who hoped for a romantic getaway or who brought family. The Hotel Felix does not meet the expectation of luxury that accompanies a 4-star rating. This is a great place to stay if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on business and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need lots of space. Not recommended for couples.

The pictures looked great but I did read through reviews about the small rooms...paid extra for double beds since I was not traveling alone. Location: First of all, the location of the hotel was great for us. It's very close to State Street, Magnificent Mile, etc. without being in the thick of it. It's just outside of those areas so you still have the peace and quiet of a quaint neighborhood. The hotel is also located within walking distance of many great eateries, Trader Joes, Whole Foods, a U.S. Post Office, etc. Cleanliness: Well this is where it lacked quite a bit. The cleaning service they did was...almost non-existent. The first day we checked in at about 3:00pm, we were trying to catch some rest but the maid service kept banging on our door. We just checked in, we do not need service. Secondly, it seems like they do not know what a duster is - our room was filled with dust every day. There was one day where our room was not cleaned - we got back to the hotel at about 8pm - suddenly a woman just lets herself in the room (no knocking) and quickly apologizes and closes the door (to be fair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is a privacy lock and a secondary lock which we forgot to activate this night). I'll assume that was the maid...at 8:30pm. I found hairs around the room of different colors so I knew they didn't belong to me. Overall - it just felt...unclean. I did notice a slight improvement at the end of the week when another maid was working the floor. Room: As other reviewers have mentioned - the rooms are small. There is basically no closet. I lived out of my suitcases, the beds include two drawers each if you want to use it. We had a double room so we were fit in pretty tight. We were also placed on the third floor which gave us a nice view of a cement wall outside our window. The walls are a bit thin. I knew when my neighbor was coming/going, taking a shower, etc. Luckily we were placed in the corner so I didn't have to hear too much hallway noise. Microwave/Mini Fridge: NONE Air Conditioning: I guess as a green hotel, their air conditioning units only allow for automatic settings. Our AC unit kept kicking on and off during the night - it was loud and got really hot in between the kick-ons. Bathroom: The bathroom is actually a good size. There is a complete lack of counter space which made getting ready a bit of a headache. The shower head was pretty weak and I didn't like that there was no bottom water spout...and the shower head was not one of those removable heads. Staff: I didn't talk much to the staff. When I checked in - the staffer had a bit of a speech issue and I had to keep having to ask him to repeat his question...and he finally snapped his question out. Wonderful, thanks for the welcome. Greetings back to the hotel were scattered and my check-out staff was cold and short. Internet: Free Wi-fi! This is definitely a huge plus for me. I had almost no issues with the wifi during this trip. There was one day where I saw a huge crowd checking in and that day, the internet was much slower...but all in all - it worked great! Loved having the free wifi. Would I stay here again? I would consider it...it really wasn't too bad and I thought we got a pretty good deal on our stay.

I didn't have room to put my suitcase on the fold-out suitcase holder because it would have blocked the door; I was unable to remove my shoes from my suitcase because I would not have had anywhere to put them; there are no closets, just a corner of the room with a hanging bar. The room basically has space for the bed and that's it -- I've stayed many places in NYC and Europe and I can deal with a small room, but these are exceptionally small. Another problem: there was no electrical outlet in my bathroom. Want to use the blow dryer? You have to do it in the bedroom, where the light is terrible -- this is a real problem for a woman with business meetings who needs to look polished. Basically, in addition to the size and design issues, my big problem was that the front desk staff was lackadaisical at best and surly at worst. I called down to see if I could get a robe (my room didn't have a robe when I checked in; the towels were also still stained with someone else's make-up). They never brought me one. I called the front desk to see if they could tell me how long it would take to get to O'Hare, and when I expressed disbelief at the clerk's estimate of an hour (at 11am), he actually snapped at me. (For what it's worth, the trip to O'Hare instead took 22 minutes.) I had issues checking out, and my key kept getting demagnetized, and every time I tried to deal with these problems, the staff acted as if they were doing me a favor -- on one occasion, in fact, I went down to get my key fixed and there was no one at the front desk for over fifteen minutes.

I contacted Hotel Felix after bidding and they were able to upgrade us to a King, but did not have two doubles available. When families bid on a four star hotel in Chicago they are not thinking boutique hotel, but more along the lines of the Hyatt, Hilton Suites, Embassy Suites, etc... In other words, large hotels with a long list of amenities. I even contacted Priceline to voice my concerns, but they were completely unresponsive. The bottom line is my wife and I found a great hotel for a future couple only getaway, but will not use Priceline in the future.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cWorked for our limited requirements, but not really four-star\u201d", "Author": "WITraveller251", "ReviewID": "UR102946541", "Content": "My best friend & I stayed in the Felix on a recent \"girls weekend\" trip to Chicago.

Plenty of room to move around, even to plug in an electric wheelchair. The room was immaculate and beautifully furnished. The only problem I encountered was the folks next door were quite loud. It was St. Pat's weekend, and they came home drunk about 3 am and were extremely boisterous. After attempts to get them to quiet down were unsuccessful, I called the desk. Within minutes, a staff member was knocking on their door and telling them to keep it down. The front desk gave me 15% discount on our parking at checkout, for our inconvenience. Charles the doorman was polite, helpful, knowledgeable about the neighborhood and generally a friendly guy. Everyone working in the hotel made our stay pleasant. There was a bartender who offered advice on places to go outside the hotel. There was the housekeeping employee (I don't know his name) who saw me carrying three cups of coffee, and dropped what he was doing to help me take them up to my room. Other than my neighbors, the room was extremely quiet (although I agree the walls are probably on the thin side). The location couldn't be beat.

First of all, I have to say that we couldn't beat the price we got ($50 each before taxes)! The hotel has a great lobby that is decorated in very trendy decor with a very warm, long fireplace located next to a sitting area near the bar. The hotel was very clean and the staff was generally friendly, although they didn't really say much to me at check-in our check-out, and come to think of it didn't even thank me for staying there at check-out. Our room was also fairly quiet to street noise, but there was quite a bit of noise noticeable from the room next door. Reading previous TA reviews, we all expected small rooms, but \"small\" kind of seems like an understatement for something that priceline classifies as a 4 star hotel. \"Miniature\" seemed like a better description of our rooms. The biggest issue that we were disappointed with was the complete lack of space in our room! There was barely enough room for me to squeeze by the desk at the foot of our bed to get around to the area on my side of the bed near the window (I had to turn sideways and scoot by the desk chair just to get past it, and I don't see how I could have moved the chair to anywhere else in the room). In addition, there was barely enough room to put my feet down on the side on the bed when sitting on the bed or getting up out of bed. It seemed like the so called queen size bed did not appear to be a queen sized bed as it was much smaller than a typical queen sized bed, and the pillows they gave you to sleep with were squares that were about half the size of a typical pillow - \"miniature\". Also, there was barely any closet to speak of (literally a hole in the wall with a curtain in front of it), and the faucet in the bathroom barely had any space underneath the nozzle where you were able to rinse your hands with water while washing your hands (and to complicate matters, we had a slow drain, so my hands got dipped in the sink water every time I went to wash my hands). The shower was probably the most spacious part of our entire room and was very nice. Again, I was pleased with the price we received for these 2 rooms, along with the service, cleanliness of the rooms, and the decor, but for Priceline to categorize this as a 4 star hotel seems extremely misleading given that the rooms are barley big enough to walk around in and that on Priceline's website it states that 4 star hotels \"...offer a wide selection of amenities with the guest's comfort in mind\". I hardly consider this a hotel where the guest's comfort was in mind in terms of the size of the rooms! If you get this hotel through the name your own price feature on Priceline, it is an okay hotel for $50, but if you are thinking of booking this hotel by your own choice, I would look for a hotel with bigger rooms.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ChicagoIL", "Title": "\u201cDarling Boutique hotel---such a great value\u201d", "Author": "LIDChicagoIL", "ReviewID": "UR93849858", "Content": "I stayed at the Hotel Felix for one night, in Jan 2011.

Lots of reviews start with the small rooms, and I'll get to that. But I liked that the hotel is small. It's not some 1,000 room chain. The lobby is compact but efficient, with great design elements. I spent time there just hangin' in the morning drinking the free coffee and reading a free newspaper. Check-in was fast and the clerk was friendly and when he made a minor goof, cutely self-deprecating. Maybe he liked us, or maybe it was the luck of the computer assigning a room, but we got 12th (top) floor, with a view north across Huron St. As a Priceline booking, it was indeed a queen room, but I think it was one of the somewhat larger 1Q rooms. I could easily get around the room, there was a bag stand and I could fit a 'carry-on max' roller bag on it between the beside table and the desk. Liked the full-laptop sized in-room safe, too. I thought the room decor was cool, I liked the color choices, and the halogen lights over the bed -- very Vegas. I didn't try to read, I could imagine that this was not great task lighting. Bed was very comfy. One complaint - not just of this hotel - is having a plush down comforter that is way too effective/warm for the ambient room temp. How about a spring-weight down duvet? Still looks great but not so stifling. It was that or just a sheet: hot or cold. I heard about iffy WiFi so brought a LAN cable and that worked well in the room - I'd recommend it, it's more secure that open WiFi (I think) and didn't hiccup once. Desk was small but very workable, solidly built, and I liked the desk chair. The thermostat was weird: When I set the temp, it first ran the a/c, then just fan, then heat, all for the same 69 deg setting. It was a little noisy. Quieter than many thru-the-wall units in low-rise motels, but still a compressor noise near the bathroom which was odd. HVAC noise didn't keep me up, I don't think, once I found how to have the fan run continuously. I also heard too much of my neighbors plumbing, and several neighbor's door \"ka-chunks!\". Didn't get a great sleep, in fact. I think despite $30M in remodels, they may have cheaped on the between-room insulation, or couldn't totally overcome the old buildings internals. The bathroom, though, was great. Compact, but nice style and a great, great shower. I loved the big green shower tile! I did not love the TP made from recycled paper - very coarse. There just has to be softer \"green\" TP out there!! Overall, I thought this was a fun, interesting boutique hotel. Friendly staff, no hassles for being Priceline (got extended checkout with ease, too), I enjoyed the lively yet cozy lobby space. Someone recommended Yolk, 3 blks away, for breakfast, and I second that! I also agree with reviews that say this isn't a 4 star hotel. It's a nice specialty hotel with a few issues (poor noise separation between rooms, some rooms tiny - the folks across were packing and leaving and I saw their 1Q room was really, really small). To class this with the real Magnificent Mile 4-star properties would be a mistake. If you get a deal on price vs. the big name big hotels, take it, and try it for a short stay.

We ended up turning it off because of the sound of vibrating metal when the unit ran. The room stayed nicely warm with the unit off.

First, the hotel has a great, chic interior. The lobby is nice overall and the lounge areas are fantastic. The hotel staff was always helpful but there were a few things that really irritated me. First - and this seems silly - but the stupid door signs kept falling off. You think its silly until you have the maid knocking at your door at 8am because the sign fell off the door. The maid walked in several times. Crazy! Second - like others have seen - the sink is CRAZY shallow. Like, maybe 2 inches or something. You can't even wash you hands under it. It works ok for brushing your teeth I guess. The walls inside the room are thin. You can hear most everything going on outside the room and in other rooms. So, that was awkward sometimes!! LOL And finally - the room itself is minuscule. You can't pull out the desk chair without hitting the bed in the single rooms. And if you want to sit in the chair to watch tv - its above the desk so its like sitting in the front row at a movie theatre. But, I did love the shower and the choice of soaps/lotions they give you. The towels were fine but I've felt better. The bed was super comfy and so were the pillows and linens. And the beds did have drawers under them so you can pull them out and store things inside them. Overall - it was a nice hotel room - but if you plan on bringing a few friends with you - don't attempt to get more than 2 people into any of the rooms. We upgraded from a 1 bed to a 2 bed room. And even with the 2 bed room (which has more space) my friend and I were walking all over each other. But, to reiterate - I'd still recommend the hotel. The people were friendly. The hotel was convenient to the red line and some busses. You are just around the corner from a walgreens, eggsperience (great breaksfast), portillo's (best hot dogs!), Gino's East (Chicago Pizza) and just a few blocks from Michigan avenue and all the shopping.

The bathroom products were another surprise: H-2-0 From the boutique shop on Michigan Ave. The location is in the heart of the best dining and shopping in Chicago.The neighborhood couldn't be better or safer. The big topper was the restaurant Elate in the downstairs lobby! I had two fabulous meals; dinner(the waiter loved his job and reccomended wonderful dishes). and Sunday Brunch (Yummy menu-I had the Tostada dish and my friend had Ricotta Pancakes...We were so happy!!)

Because it was a blind bid, I expected one of the smaller queen bed rooms that many have whined about. But on checkin we were given a king bed room on the ninth floor that was quite large. Hip decor and very comfortable. Bed was a 10 - absolutely comparable to the best we've ever slept in, including the Ritz. Staff was very friendly and helpful, especially doormen Julian and Benjamin. Parking directly across the street for $35 a day was very convenient. Nice location - walk a couple of blocks to Rush Street for lots of great restaurants. Tempo on Chestnut for breakfast was great as always and very close. Easy walk to Magnificent Mile.

Hotel Lobby and ammenities- I was very impressed by the overall decor and ambience of the hotel. It's very trendy and pleasant. There is a spa, fitness room, and business center with 3 desktops. I used a spa one evening for ashi massage. It was good, not the best, but I did enjoy it. You get $20 off coupon when you check in. So, the price was reasonable. There is also a restaurant Elate adjacent to the hotel. I went there for breakfast and dinner. All I have to say - WOW. Omelete was unbelievable, the best I've ever had, and trout in the evening didn't disappoint. Be prepared to spend at least $20 for breakfast and $50 for dinner. But it was well worth it. Rooms - Even though many people stated that rooms were small, I found them to be just perfect. After all, you don't go to downtown Chicago to spend your time in the hotel. That said, I can see how it could be tight for 2 people considering there is not much closet space but there are drawers under the bed so that's a big plus. Flat screen TV, free HBO, and free wi-fi is in every room. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was very big and finally, no tub. I loved the shower. Very contemporary decor, with light and dark colors and no more of that casino green/red/yellow carpeting. A couple of minor setbacks - bathroom sink was very shallow, virtually no room for hands under the faucet. With respect to cleanliness, the only reason I gave it a 4 was due to the fact that black carpeting tends to attract dirt and I could see some dirt scattered near the elevator doors. Hotel Staff / Valet - The hotel staff was super friendly. It took only a couple of minutes to check in / check out. Valet guys were always ready to assist. One suggestion, contact valet staff 15 to 20 min prior of needing your car. Otherwise, you may get frustrated waiting for it. The parking lot they use is 5 blocks away from the Hotel Felix. The cost is $42 per day with in and out privileges. I first thought of using adjacent parking lots but it didn't make sense due to only $2 to $5 difference in price.

Well, Sat. night in Chicago won out. What a surprise we had. Yes, the location is 5-6 blocks from where we would like to be. Yes, it is an old building and doesn't look like a 4 star hotel. We were ready to hate everything. Then we pulled up and the doormen took over. These guys were better than any 5 star hotel. Tim & Benjamin won us over. Very, very friendly, they had us parked at a reasonable rate and on our way to the desk. Again, extremely friendly , efficient staff, and our room was ready. After all the negative comments we were ready for the worst. Wrong again. The building is old but totally renovated. It was 90 degrees outside, but very cool all over the lobby, halls and in our room. Yes, the room is really small, but we travel in Europe every year----you haven't seen small! Also, we are not a fan of modern decor, but this was delightful. Everything was so new and clean. About the bed-----one of the best we have ever had in a hotel, extremely comfortable. We did not have glasses in the room, but when we asked they were there in 5 min. Housekeeping, top knotch. Off we went to see Chicago on foot. It was a bit of a hike up to Michigan Ave. but doable and there were many restaurants, bars, and music within walking distance of the hotel. I think we took a cab twice. Now it was 8pm on a Sat. night and we had no dinner reservations. Benjamin, the doorman, suggested a few places within a few blocks and we headed out. Yikes! Every place was packed and had people waiting in line outside. Back to The Felix. Benjamin made a few calls and got us in Sullivan's Steak House a few blocks away. This was the highlight of our adventure. Absolutely perfect! Fantastic room, food, and service.It will definitely go on our \"best restaurant\" list. Thank you, Benjamin! So, would we stay at The Felix again? Yes, depending on the price. Because of the small rooms, a 1 or 2 night stay is very doable.

There were also rather strange housekeeping practices that kept us intrigued but certainly not amused. The day after we arrived, housekeeping left a fresh set of toiletries in the bathroom, presumably to replace what we had already used on our first day there. However, we did not start on the new set of toiletries immediately as we hadn't finished the original lot. Inexplicably, on subsequent days, one item after another disappeared from the bathroom. First the second tube of shampoo was removed from our room and then a tube of shower gel. In their place, we were given tube after tube of hair conditioner which we did not need or use! This made us think that certain items were in short supply eg. the shampoo and others were in abundance, eg. the hair conditioner and the housekeeping staff had to keep juggling to make ends meet.

We travel a fair bit, so we have stayed in our share of hotels both good and bad. We were extremely happy in every respect with this hotel, and cannot recommend it highly enough. The location is excellent (whole foods 1 block east, Fogo De Chao & wallgreens 1 block south, centrally located), the hotel itself is beautiful and modern, with a clean and cool aesthetic, and there is a parking garage 1 block south that charges 23 dollars a day (very reasonable). In short, this hotel was perfect in every respect and there is nothing to complain about. The rooms are very cute and clean, with trendy furnishings. The beds are very comfortable, and the sheets are some of the softest we have ever felt in a hotel. The pillows, while squarish, are very comfortable and we did not feel the need to ask for more. The rooms are somewhat smallish, but they are perfectly suitable for a couple or two friends. Those with families may find them cramped, but keep in mind this a boutique hotel. You trade space for class, a good deal in our minds, and at 100 dollars a night this really can't be beat. Let me just address a few of the common complaints that I read when choosing this hotel. We had no noise issues whatsoever. The beds and pillows were great. The staff was very helpful. The walk-in shower is gorgeous, and the sink is perfectly usable (and cool!). The internet is free AND wireless, a common complaint with many other hotels.Even the complimentary shampoo and soap was very high quality.

First off, I NEVER write reviews unless I can say something nice. But I've been pushed too far not to share this with others so they don't suffer. The hotel needs to seriously train all their staff since no one seems to know anything about their jobs. The front desk doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t listen to the customer, and will give you \u00e2\u20ac\u0153attitude\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd if you try to clarify things (to minimize errors). The end result, errors in your stay, from wake-up calls to service charges. The General Manager can best be described in his own words, \"I don't know how to do that\", \"I'm not responsible for that\", \"I'm trying to help, but maybe it's your fault\". WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. The general manager is IN CHARGE. Accounting. Wow! One person. No one else has authority. Or so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m told, but I know that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not true since I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve dealt with the hotel several times trying to fix billing errors from previous stays. Again, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m teaching them, since no one seems to know anything, or care. I've been charged incorrectly time, and time, again. My corporate partners also have had similar problems. Trying to get the charges fixed is another frustration that is compounded by even more errors. I wish this was a one-time thing, but between myself, and my co-workers, we've never seen anything like it. Time is money, and the time I've spent on the phone with the hotel trying to fix Hotel Felix's mistakes is ridiculous. Billing: No one there seems to have any idea how to do what hotels do every day. The one thing they DO have down pat is billing. They just don't seem to know how to bill CORRECTLY. Worse yet, they don't know how to reverse those charges, resulting in compounded billing errors. My travel expense report is now sooooooooooo confusing with all the hotels errors, I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t even figure it out! Calling the hotel and getting someone on the phone in accounting is at best - 1 in a 1000. Only one person can access accounts, and that person is never at their desk. If and when HE does try to correct the problem, he does it WRONG. There seems to be no one accountable for anything, and worse yet, only one person can do one job, with no backups. Finally, (the last straw) the hotel personnel ask ME to do their work in getting information to fix billing errors from the corporate credit card company. Of course the Mastercard company is clueless why I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m calling them asking for information the MURCHANT normally (and easily) does every day, to reverse charges incorrectly applied. The rooms are small, and smell like cooking grease. The best thing I can say about hotel, is house cleaning does a nice job. Expect some smiles at the front desk, but also expect attitude.

This place is Leeds certified and tries to avoid waste and needless energy consumption with various equipment and ideas. It used to be the old Wacker Hotel and was built in 1926. It went through it's complete remake just last year with new HVAC, electrical, plumbing, elevators, fire systems and interior. The Elate restaurant and bar and the small bar in the lobby are perfect and the meals and happy hour specials are great. The food is chef prepared and the bartendresses are pretty, smart, and professional. Don't be afraid of the ratings complaining of room size, we had no problem with a bit smaller room and it was very cozy. At one time we had 8 of our friends in the room for a few beers and snacks and it was crowded and fun.

No extra chair. There was JUST the desk chair for sitting. Anyone else had to sit on the bed. Pillows were all the same - and very THICK. Complimentary one-size-fits-all robe appeared to be a women's size 10. No coffee maker in the room. No surface space to put anything, especially suitcases. No dressers. There are four large drawers built-in to the bottom of the bed. This worked OK for us but older folks might find the bending and kneeling to be a challenge. When the drawers are open they are major obstructions and no one can pass by. If someone was sitting at the desk, you nearly had to crawl over the end of the bed to get around them! No light on the clock for night-time viewing. Very few outlets for charging cell phones, etc. The heat was hard to control and noisy. When it cycled on, you would get a blast of cold air in your face, even though the vent was on the opposite wall. I rarely write a bad hotel review on TA. In fact, most of the time I am delighted with our room. The Hotel Felix, though, was disappointing in so many ways. I guess the smallness of the room was the worst aspect. Three days of climbing over the bed to get around the ONE desk chair in the room did not create warm-fuzzies. Other folks wrote about how welcoming the staff was. No one ever said one word to us. Not a \"Hello\" or \"Welcome\". Nothing. But that is no big deal. I only mention it because it is in sharp contrast to many other postive comments about the staff. While we were there, a man came to the front desk saying that the room he was just assigned was already occupied. I read about this happening in other traveler's posts, too. Apparently there is free coffee in the lobby in the morning. We weren't told about this but over-heard reception telling another guest about it. When we went downstairs for coffee at 8:00 a.m., there was only decaf remaining. I would not want to stay here again. The room seemed too small for even one person to move about comfortably.

Front desk staff were friendly, knowledgable, accommodating (suggesting local restaurants, early check-in).

The evening waitstaff friendly (although a slight bit 'green', he didn't know much about the beer or the premise of the restaurant), the food delicious (their burger with creamed leeks and applewood smoked bacon was one of the best I've ever tasted), the drinks well mixed and strong. The morning waiter was the only one working the busy breakfast crowd. He was able to handle it well and did a great job. The only downfall was the snotty 'don't-you-know-we're not Starbucks?' reply my friend received upon asking for a vanilla latte. This was soon followed by more high-and-mighty tone of the 'local' and 'organic' products served at the restaurant. I was witness to this the night before, too, sitting at the bar alongside the owner who, from conversation, thinks that 'local' and 'sustainable' make him exclusive and important.

There are several nice things about this hotel, most notably the friendly and helpful staff. The common areas are very nice, and the hotel is clean and well-kept. The location is good -- on the corner of Huron and Clark -- with easy access to the Magnificent Mile and a short cab ride or long walk to the cultural attractions. There are also several shortcomings: the rooms and the bathrooms are the size of postage stamps -- really tiny, with very little space for hanging clothes or sitting to read the paper (one small barrel chair). The clock does not have an illuminated dial, making it difficult to see the time if you happen to wake up some time during the night or early morning. The amenities are second class -- rough toilet paper, meager towels, lousy hair dryer, etc. The Hotwire price for two nights was $488 including tax and related charges, compared to $740 at The Talbott, my favorite Chicago hotel. So the savings is considerable -- enough to cover the outrageous amount we spent for transportation while we were there. Also, the elevators are really small, not adequate for the volume of transport during the busy times of the day. We often had to wait for a second or third elevator. And the wifi didn't work at all.

Staff were helpful, particularly the front desk who gave me directions and helped me book theatre tickets. Only one small problem when I got there to check in, they gave me a key and when I used it to access 'my' room there was a man's case and clothes in there. Lucky he was not in the room (or the shower) at the time. So I went down and told the front desk, they promptly moved me to a slightly larger room. I was happy with that but later on that evening two guys tried to get into my room. Turned out that they had been given a key for the same room! I was in bed at the time but luckily (thank goodness) I had dead bolted the door. If not, it would have not been a good experience. They had to go down and let Reception know - so I wasn't overly impressed with how the rooms are allocated. That aside, I really liked the hotel. It's small but very functional and as it's a boutique the rooms are decorated very nicely. It was very comfortable and the location meant that I was right in the heart of the Windy City - perfect for a first-time visitor such as myself.

I had booked the room through Priceline where it was listed as a 4 star hotel, recently renovated. The pictures looked nice so I was excited to go. We arrived late, around 11 pm. We were greeted by the valet/bellman/doorman who helped us unload our luggage and parked our car (valet parking was the only option at more than $40 per night which isn't really unusual in Chicago) Check in went smoothly, but they wanted an additional $35 per night for a king size bed. Seemed a bit pricey so we decided to try the queen room. There was no one to help us up with our bags so we took the luggage cart upstairs ourselves. The elevator was so small it barely fit the cart and and two of us. It should have been a sign. The hotel was nicely decorated and very clean. We stayed on the 8th floor. When we opened the door to our room, we both almost died of shock. The room was so small I couldn't believe it! My freshman door room 20 years ago was bigger! There was one bed, I am not sure it was even a queen size. No closet, simply a bar sticking out of the wall on which to hang your things. You could pull a curtain over it to close the \"closet.\" There was an in room safe on the shelf in the closet which was a nice feature. There was an iron, but no ironing board. There was no dresser. The bed was a platform bed that had two drawers that pulled out of the foot of the bed. You couldn't open the drawers and walk around the bed at the same time. There was a narrow desk with a very nice flat screen TV above it, but it was to the side of the bed so you either had to lay side ways or not see the TV. There was no place to unpack your luggage or even stow your luggage after you unpack. The bathroom was nice, but the sink had no vanity space for makeup, etc. The shower was nice and the toiletries were high quality but there was no body lotion, only shampoo, conditioner and body wash. The hotel had an ice machine and Pepsi machine on each floor which was convenient. The ice bucket had no plastic liner so I had to use the zip lock bag I brought. There were no drinking glasses to use other than two bathroom ceramic glasses, very small in size. Dont count on any type of view from the room. We looked out onto another buildlng under construction, wrapped in plastic that whipped in the wind. The bed was a pillow top and very comfortable. However the bedding was a sheet, heavy comforter and another sheet. We melted under the comforter or got cold under just the sheet. The air conditioning was inconsistent. We set it to 67 to try not to sweat through the night, but the fan would turn on and off so we went from hot to cold all night. The first morning, we had a Do not Disturb sign on the door as we wanted to sleep in. That didn't stop housekeeping from knocking three or four times. When that didn't work, they called us. I sense they may have missed the point of the sign. We didn't eat in the restaurant as it seemed to have a limited menu. There is a Whole Foods grocery store about a block away and it was a great source of breakfast (although we had to eat on the bed as there was no other place for us to set the food) We also found a great place for breakfast about four blocks away called Yolks. Try the breakfast burrito and go with the fresh fruit. It was yummy! Overall the Felix was nicely decorated and clean, but I am not sure how it was a four star hotel. I expect a bit more for the price and star rating. For example, would have been nice to have a loaner umbrella when it unexpectedly rained, but they did not have any to loan.

Staff were friendly and helpful and the bar, though small, was no bad place to come back to at the end of the day. In all, we spent ten days there and were we to visit Chicago again would certainly not bypass The Phoenix.

They were just so rude to me on the phone, and they made me very aware that b/c I'm a Hotwire customer I'm a second rate customer. I made a mistake I'll never make again: I booked a room at Hotel Felix through Hotwire. If you're clever with Hotwire, you can pretty much figure out which hotel you'll get during the booking process. I was initially very excited to land a room at the Hotel Felix ... then I called them and it was all downhill from there. I've been a big fan of Hotwire for years: I like an adventure (never know exactly where you'll stay until your credit card is already charged) and in these times we all needs to save a few bucks on a hotel - hey, I'm a librarian, and we don't exactly roll in the dough! I've never had a problem getting a two bed room for two people with a Hotwire reservation (I usually travel with library colleagues): make your reservation via Hotwire, call the hotel to confirm and select your room type, and you're good to go! Not with Hotel Felix. I was told my reservation was for a single queen bed hotel room and they would not honor my request for an \"upgrade\" to a two bed room. Per the Hotwire terms of service, Hotel Felix informed me, all that they had to do was provide me with a room that would accommodate two people, and that could even be just a full size bed. Basically, Hotel Felix conveyed that b/c I made a reservation via Hotwire, I'm a second rate customer and eligible only for the smallest, least popular room type. I inquired about availability of two bed rooms and was told that there were plenty, but they wouldn't be \"upgrading\" me b/c they didn't have to. I called Hotwire, and they just referred to their terms of service: \"Room type will be determined by the hotel based on the number of guests provided at time of booking. All reservations are booked for stays in non-smoking rooms (subject to availability). Hotel room assignments are determined at check-in and upgrades are not available.\" A Hotwire agent, Don, did try to contact the hotel but they were unwilling to budge. Don let me know that I might be able to \"upgrade\" when I arrive, but not to count on it. There's fine print, and then there's customer service, don't you think? So now Hotel Felix has my money and Hotwire has its fee and I'm arriving in two weeks and just dreading it. Both Hotwire and Hotel Felix have forever lost my future business as well as that of my friends and family.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms, but very comfortable\u201d", "Author": "holiday092", "ReviewID": "UR33033285", "Content": "The Hotel Felix is brand new.

LOCATION: Hotel Felix is only a walking distance from the Chicago brown and red L lines just outside of the Loop.

Millennium Park is only about a 20 minute walk from the hotel with lots shopping and restaurants on the way. ROOM As in most big cities, our room was pretty small, but extremely clean and comfortable (especially the fluffy, queen size bed). There is a flat screen HDTV with cable and an alarm clock radio complete with an ipod dock. The room is designed to be space efficient with storage drawers under the bed, a small alcove to hang a few clothes, shelved night stands and a cabinet in the bathroom. The bathroom was also very modern looking with a well sized shower stall complete with a rainfall shower head and nice variety of H20 bath products. The room was noise proof and we never heard neighbors or people in the hall. FACILITIES The funky lounge was a great area for guests to hang out or enjoy coffee and tea in the morning.

I entered a small lobby with two conversation lounge areas and bar near a fireplace for intimate socializing. The decor was a soothing eco-friendly setting for a professional or trendy meet place. The front desk staff was very friendly and were especially accommodating to all of our requests, as were the bellman (who even ran to the store for me). I only experienced single rooms, which were quite small but efficiently designed for storage & comfort. The feel of the room was modern with earth tones for a relaxing atmosphere. The queen size bed had drawers built into the platform, eliminating the need for a dresser. There was soft cotton bedding, fluffy pillows and a duvet comforter on a very comfy mattress. The bathroom had a roomy stone tile stall shower with no tub, with a modern basin, non harsh lighting, thick cotton towels and hotel toiletries. To keep the room uncluttered, the flat paneled TV was wall mounted, a reduced size club chair was placed in a corner. The only horizontal place to put things were the compact desk area with wifi, a small modern table next to the club chair and two night tables on either side of the bed. The closet was compact but adequate for the single room. I missed out on the fitness room and spa (tight schedule), but I used the business center, which had free internet service and a printer/fax. There were also several meeting rooms, which looked comfortable when I peeked in. As far as I know, my group very satisfied with the hotel, with no memorable complaints, except one who had trouble navigating around the platform bed. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss the restaurant ZED451 just one block away.

The bed was possibly the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept on. The rooms came with free Wi-Fi which was nice being there on business, and included HD TV's and iPod docking stations which was great. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and all of the doormen were excellent. Most of the time I was there, I dealt with Julian, and every time I went somewhere he took the time to ask where I was going and if I needed directions, and every time I returned he asked how each specific experience was. Each doorman remembered my name after asking it only once. The housekeeping staff was always around when I would leave the room, and would always ask if I wanted service or if I wanted them to wait.
