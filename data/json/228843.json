You will enjoy the challenge of showering without bumping your knees or elbows and slithering past the toilet to towel yourself dry in front of the sink, avoiding hitting your head on the hairdryer. If you are very tall, your knees might even touch the wall when you are on the loo!!! I couldn't open both doors of the wardrobe without moving the bed, and I thought there was hanging space only. After the room had been cleaned, my own hairdryer wasn't on the bed where I had left it and I was convinced it had been stolen!!! Fortunately, I discovered that on the left hand side of the wardrobe there were, in fact, some shelves and that it had been tidied it away! These challenges apart, I would unreservedly recommend this hotel. It is in an excellent position, within walking distance of the Gard du Nord - (uphill on the way back as you drag your suitcase) - and perfect for walking to the Opera area and beyond. The street is quiet so you shouldn't be disturbed at night. The decor is quiet and tasteful, and the bed linen soft. The standard of cleanliness is excellent. The breakfast was perfect - delicious coffee, fruit juice with \"bits\" (not that horrible diluted squash-like drink served in some hotels), fruit salad, yoghurts, cereal, a range of pastries and bread, good quality jams and honey, as well as cheese and ham. The scrambled eggs were some of the best I have ever tasted, and there were crepes, too. The dining room is in the basement (perhaps a converted wine cellar?) It is small and you might have to make friends with the people on the table next to you in high season, but I went in March and the guests were mostly business people who didn't spend long eating. There is even a small garden. I would stay there again (and take some plasters in case I grazed myself in the bathroom!)", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIdeal for short break\u201d", "Author": "Nojhaslam", "ReviewID": "UR126540367", "Content": "My wife and here stayed here for 2 nights, and for our needs it was ideal. - LOCATION: It is roughly equidistant between Notre Dame and the Eiffel Tower (around 2 miles to each), so perfectly walkable if you have a decent pair of shoes.

The local area also seems to be more typically Parisian - i.e. small, independent shops rather than chains. - HOTEL: the exterior and reception are beautiful, and seem much better than you have any right to expect from a 3* hotel. - STAFF: this won't matter to everyone, but our French isn't great so to have a staff that speak great English is a great help. For example, I wanted some moules et frites while I was there, and I was directed to somewhere that was great. They also offered a shuttle service to the airport upon check-in, which when you're on limited time is a great help. - ROOMS: the rooms aren't cavernous, but should suit your needs perfectly.

A brief, easy walk to Sacre Coeur, easily in walkable distance of the Moulin Rouge, Hard Rock Cafe, Perfume Museum, and many other paris sights. The hotel itself is rather clean.

It was not dirty in the slightest. The room was small, almost minuscule, but that is to be expected from European Hotels, and it is all functional. They have English-language television, and a safe in the room. You have to drop the key at Reception when you leave, a common theme between European Hotels, but something I dislike doing. It has a small elevator. The location is 7/10 - There are some great boulangerie (Bakeries), butcheries, chocolatiers, and cheese shops nearby and a good little cafe called \"The No Stress Cafe\" (the Vietmanese Salad is great). If you wander too far one way, you'll find yourself in a sleazy area, near the Moulin Rouge. This is about 5-6 blocks away from the hotel in one direction. If you wonder 5-6 blocks in the other direction, you find yourself at Galleries Lafayette, a shopping mall and one of the most expensive areas of Palace.

The hotel is between Opera and Montmartre so great for walking in any direction but Metro stations are very close by. I would highly recommend this as an affordable hotel in Paris.

Good points - The location - a 20 minute, most of it flat, walk from Gare du nord and 5 mins (if that) from the metro station. It felt very much like a residential area, you could watch people coming home from work and going into their apartments in the building opposite and there were plenty of lovely little boulangeries, fruit shops, patisseries etc on the Rue des Martyrs. Yes, the red light area is a few streets away in the other direction, but it didn't encroach at all and I would have felt perfectly happy to walk around alone at night. Very clean & stylish room. Crisp white bedding, good a/c, powerful shower. Double glazing virtually entirely blocked out any noise - during the day it could be quite loud from scooters & kiddies from the school a few buildings down. Great night's sleep - it was very quiet at night - we didn't hear a peep from any other rooms. The bed was possibly the memory foam type - it was low and very comfortable with a duvet & thick soft pillows. Bad points - Minor niggles really....slightly mean bath towels and the hairdryer was one of those attached to the wall in the bathroom which I'm not a great fan of. Charge for the wifi of 4 euro per 24 hours (tip - when you log in you need to press done, then go rather than go & go) Little kitchenette area with fridge - we used the fridge but it would have been more useful if there had been perhaps a couple of plates, some cutlery etc provided which there wasn't.

We were able to stock up on a few breakfast snacks from the local Carrefour (4 mins walk). The breakfast isn't included, it is 13 Euros per person per day. We felt it was a bit steep especially as neither of us eat very much for breakfast, we would just have a coffee and snack out for much cheaper. There are two metro stations quite close by, but its also a good location from which to walk into central Paris. My companion and I walked to the louvre and then along the champs elysee, and then to the eiffel tower all in one day (Good Shoes Recommended!). Close by are a few nice boutiques, and some restaurants - an indian, and a duck restaurant are ones I remember. Also close by is a magazine/souvenir stand.

Just me and the wife on a romantic get away for 4 days. Ideal location for people who hate to be a part of the hectic and false tourist image of Paris or anywhere for that matter. The Room we had was of a good size, decent bathroom and we had a fridge and cooking area (that we never asked for). The room also had a small wardrobe with a safe. The room has a small LCD tv and you can get CNN, BBC World and Eurosport in english. The rooms were cleaned daily to a very good standard with the toiletries always being topped up and towels changed. The staff were very helpful and never short of a smile and whilst not all of the staff speak fluent English they will do their up most to help out. The breakfast is a typical euro style affair with coissants, pain au chocolat, bread, cheese meats etc etc and is served down in the basement by a pleasant African lady. And please don't be affraid to ask for more if it's not there. The Main foyer is clean and pleasant with seating. You can also pick up a free English paper (the Guardian). Out the back is a small courtyard were you can also sit to have breakfast. So to sum up the Hotel: My wife and I wished for a nice clean hotel in a quiet area near to some typical french restaurants and bars but at the same time not having to rob a bank to pay for it. The Trois Poussins fits the bill, we never wanted a hotel to stay in all day just one that would act as a pit stop for our exploration of Paris. The hotel is near the centre of Paris and is a stones throw from the Moulin Rouge and Sacre Couer. The area around the hotel is nice and relaxed, it has some nice places to eat and have a drink and a few nice shops to have look around. The Opera district is only a few minutes walk away which has even more places to eat and shop. The St Georges Metro is about 150m away and you can also get a bus (No 74) into the central shopping district of Les Halles. Finally: We only stayed for 4 days and to tell you the truth we didn't really go near any of the tourist trap areas of Paris. We sat in cafes, eat in restaurants and had a look in old shops for stuff you wouldn't get in Britian. You can eat and drink reasonably cheaply if you are bold have a bit of bottle and go to the places that the Pariseans go. I arrived at the airport talking French like Inspector Clouseau I didn't come away any better! However I tried and the French respected that (at the same time as laughing at my accent) and helped out. Treat yourself to some great food and drink and not the tourist tat and save money doing it.

A short taxi ride from Gard de Nord (10Euro) and an Ok street, (hidden school across the road and petrol station 100mts up the road that you'd never even notice unless you look hard enough) great cafe aptly named No Stress Cafe at the end of the street for typically French food/wine, great service, full of locals.

As it was, we were only 2; so no problem with this. The neighborhood was adorable and we were around few tourists. This was a definate bonus for us as in June the city is full of them. Every where we went we were dining with the locals. It is a nice neighborhood and since we were two single women we moved around with ease and no discomfort about our safety. Several nice restaurants in the area and the St. George metro is about a block away for easy access to the many sights. It only takes about 10 minutes to go anywhere. Some of the sights are very close by and it is pleasant to walk around too. Many boutiques, bakeries, grocery stores, produce markets, cheese markets, and food or wine stores a block away. A great treat is on Sunday they close the street off 1/2 block away for a market. Well dressed locals stroll about with their children getting their food purchases in a leisurely manner. This street is the Rue de Martyrs. The people working at the hotel were delightful except for one man who was business like but not particularily friendly. Not really a problem as we only saw him two times. The breakfast is a bit pricy for what they serve, but very convenient. We usually ate from the refrigerator and only had coffee at the hotel. The courtyard is adorable and a nice place to enjoy that coffee. A great experience overall. My only suggestion is to check your bill prior to checkout for accuracy. Our room was pre-paid, but there were many breakfasts on our bill that we did not order. I suspect this was due to the lack of English skills of the woman who was in the breakfast area. I would show her two fingers and point to the coffee. I think she thought I meant 2 breakfasts and two coffees. The desk had the real records as I always told the clerk what I planned to have and as a result this was remedied. It did take a bit of time, though, about 30 minutes to rectify. We loved this hotel and would definately enjoy another visit!", "Date": "July 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean, Quiet, Comfy Bed, Very Small Room\u201d", "Author": "ChiWind", "ReviewID": "UR30322055", "Content": "I booked my five night stay in mid-April (2009) asking for a room on garden side vs street side but did not get that. My very small room faced the street but it did not prevent my peaceful sleep. I was allowed to check in after an early morning arrival in Paris as my room was ready. I was able to take a needed nap immediately so I was not about to complain that there was no refrigerator as I had anticipated. The bed was very comfortable, and I am very fussy about bed comfort. The bed linens were good, the towels not that great but acceptable, as I recall. There was no chair in the small room, and I like to be able to sit and read for a bit and organize/plan my day. There was no clearance in the bathroom for my knees, if you get my drift! Lovely receptionist works at this hotel and I apologize that I cannot recall her name at this point. Yeah, the guys are not all that ready to display hospitality but they were there when needed. Yes, location is good if you are going to be using metro but I do not like being crowded in a sardine can underground. I did most of my sightseeing as a walker. It was challenging and not as easy as some other reviewer led me to believe. It takes longer to get to the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, Invalides, etc. than 20 minutes unless you have very long legs or gait! It is also a tad challenging to work out a street that will take you directly south toward the river, but I did find a favored route. I would tell you the street names, but they change as you go along so I don't want to confuse another poor soul. Eventually I broke down and bought carnet (10 tickets, about $15 US Dollars) and took metro to various sites because I was running out of Advil to relieve the leg and foot pain at end of day. I am very happy I did as much walking as I did because it really acquainted me with the city and its very different neighborhoods. Since I cannot afford 13 Euro breakfasts I have no report on that. ALSO be forewarned that the grocery store up the street, Champion, does not open until 9 am. So that does not work for yogurt in the morning when you have no fridge. I am an early bird, so I had to adjust to the \"sleepier\" mode of Paris. I managed to eat a couple salads I concocted with items from Champion at the table in the room sitting on the suitcase stool. By US standards and US dollars, none of these space issues would be acceptable, but it's not their fault that the exchange rate is what it is. I was also offered option to leave my suitcase at checkout so I could continue sightseeing on my last day in Paris before taking an evening train to Florence. I appreciated that! There is a lobby sitting area if you need to sit and read during a rainstorm (as I did). I really enjoyed going up to Sacre Coeur on a Friday evening - very convenient location to hotel - and I got to sit down inside and listen to the nuns sing at 6 pm. What lovely sweet voices! Outside on the steps were hordes of people - families and couples - listening to some pretty good \"street musician music.\" You can use your metro ticket to get up the hill and down the hills in the funicular (one apiece each way) if you are not up for the steep climb. I would give this hotel more stars for cleanliness but for the stained carpet that made you wonder when the last steam cleaning took place. Bring slippers. If you want similar price and spacious room with marble bath with shower and tub you can stay at the CDG airport at the Paris Hilton where I stayed my last night after a 6 week trip through various countries. IF YOU DO THIS...be warned that you need to bring food with you to the hotel as their restaurant is outrageously priced. But they have a big hotel that needs to be filled and there is free shuttle that runs between hotel and airport so you can take that over to the airport to eat. Also the train from the airport to the city will cost you more and you won't get the Paris neighborhood vibe. But - it's an option if you want a luxurious room with sofa and and nice bathroom same price range PLUS a full breakfast buffet included.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Midlands", "Title": "\u201cSlightly disappointing\u201d", "Author": "Northern_Girl_9", "ReviewID": "UR30147180", "Content": "Having stayed here before and found the hotel and location excellent we decided to book another short stay yet this time it did not live up to my expectations.

Breakfast - didn't feel that the breakfast justified spending 13 euros so we got breakfast food/croissants locally instead. There are also local restuarants/cafes who offer a english/continental breakfast for 8.50 euros. Nighttime - the bed was too hard for me. Waking with a stiff back and bruised hip each morning was far from ideal. - the room was far too hot...then later too cold so several times I woke to cool down/warm up. - there was a regular clanking in our room during the night, perhaps related to the hot water system Staff - twice there was no one on reception so we had to wait for our keys - a member of staff was rude when my husband couldn't find where they had put our case on departure day. It turned out that the case hadn't been put where it should have been but no apology was made. Really didn't want to be critical of this hotel as we have stayed there previously and enjoyed our stay.

We found the room got quite hot at night and the large windows would only open fully so we could not let fresh air in for any length of time as too cold for March and the air conditioning although set really low did not seem to cool us very much. But this aside we were otherwise very happy with our room. The breakfast was pretty costly so we only had this on the last morning of our stay for convenience, but otherwise ate it at local cafes. We are very friendly people who get on well with most but we did find one of the recepiton staff to be particulary unfriendly, compounded by one occasion after a long day pounding the streets we requested tea as offered in the room menu. My Husband even went to reception to save him bringing it up to our room to request it and was greeted with a Humprh!!! any teenager would be proud of as the gentleman in question was not happy at being disturbed doing something on his laptop.

The hotel is in an excellent position. Located 10-15 min walk from the rail station (Gare Du Nord) in a quiet street. The staff were welcoming and helpful (and speak English if your French isn't good!) Our room was small but clean & fresh smelling with a good sized en-suite. I don't expect that other rooms were any bigger as the building is typical Paris. If we'd stayed for longer the room may have felt a little cramped, but for our 4 nights it was perfect. My only critism of the room is typically English - there's no tea or coffee making facilities. The hotel is less than 5 min from the nearest metro station (St. Georges - turn left out of hotel, at the end of the road turn left, metro is 200yds) making it perfect for getting around Paris. If you like to walk it's approx 20min to the centre of Paris (Louvre, Notre-Dame) We didn't have breakfast in the hotel (thou it smelt lovely), but instead walked 2min to a cafe (left out of hotel, at end of road, cafe on right). Cost approx 7-10 euro, depending what you have. (hotel breakfast was 13 euro) There are also many resteraunts/bars within easy walking distance for lunch & dinner - almost too many to choose from!

The reception and lobby looked immaculate and stylish, and showed that it was very well looked after. We checked in with the lady and she was very welcoming, and also our room was ready, at 13.00 which was great! We were lucky to be on a high floor, with lovely views. The room was small, but cosy and clean with a sun-drenched balcony. We had a kitchenette, and the fridge was extremely useful for storing water in (note - a small bottle of water can cost up to 3 Euros in most places, although the fruit and veg shop on the corner of the street sells large bottles for much less!). I needed an iron and board, which I called down for and they had one available, although I was quite surprised that I had to go all the way down stairs to collect it and lug it back to my room, then back down again a few minutes later - after 8 hours of travelling it would have been nice to have had it sent up to the room. The hotel also serves room service, and their menu looks lovely (we did not try room service), and is served until 2.30am, although be aware of the price - a selection of cheeses costs 19 Euros per person. The buffet breakfast is fantastic! I read somewhere to get there early for breakfast because it does not get replenished, but on our last day we decided to go down there at 9.30am (breakfast is from 7am-10am) and the buffet was even more full than before when we used to get there early! Very good selection, with cheeses (port salut, babybel), yoghurts, pastries (croissant, pain au raisin, pain au chocolate), fruit (yes from a tin, but tasted fine), cereals, orange juice, tea/coffee. Brilliant fuel food. The location is absolutely fantastic - for example we took the Saint Georges Metro to the Louvre (including a train change) and it only took 17 minutes! The Sacre Coeur and Montmartre is within walking distance, although be aware that it is uphill all the way, but fantastic when you get there. There are many boulangeries, patisseries and lovely cafes on the way, so it is a very pretty walk. Two things though; at the bottom of the Sacre Coeur there are a few people trying to sell bracelets, and they are very pushy so try to get to the steps/tram quickly or find an alternative way, secondly the artists in Montmartre square are eager to paint you, but ask them how much their fee is first as there are stories that people had to spend 100 Euros on their portrait because they didnt ask the price beforehand! We went to a nearby Bistro on a Monday (please note that many of the nicer restaurants recommended to us from the hotel are closed on Mondays) called Jadas (or similar spelling). It was a lovely little Bistro only a 5 minute walk from the hotel, and service was very warm and friendly, highly recommended.

Our room was immaculate and was serviced daily with fresh towels etc. There was great cupboard space too which came in handy. The hotel is located in a quiet, residential area and I felt safe walking around even late at night. The metro is very close, and is also a short walk from patisseries, cafes, butchers, deli and a little supermarket. There is a patisserie that makes the BEST chocolate eclairs that I have ever tasted - if you stay here you really have to try them! The nearest metro is St Georges. From here, it took us about 10-15 minutes on the metro to get into the main attractions (you have to change of trains at Concorde to get to the Louvre, Champs-Elysses etc).

The only thing was I thought we would have a kitchenette as most of the reviews had mentioned one but our room did not have one. But this was not a problem as I had packed my travel kettle and the hotel provided me with milk every morning so I could make a cup of tea. And we would buy pastries and sit in the court yard and eat them. We never ate breakfast at the hotel as it was 10 euros each and you get far more for your money just around the corner. The hotel was in a great location near to the metro which made getting around paris fantastic. We walked to alot of things. I would like to give a special mention to the No Stress Cafe. We ate there everynight. Not because we are borring but because the food was great, the location to the hotel was great and they were fantastic with out little girl catering for everything she wanted. They do serve food in the day as I noticed one review said it didnt. We had lunch there on our last day as were were leaving around 3PM. The prices were resonable and it ment we could sit out till late and not worry about travelling back to the hotel in th dark as it is 1 mins walk away. Couple of tips visit the museums on the late night openings as the crowds are less and it is cheaper. The Louve is Wednesday and Friday and the Muse des Orsey is Thursday. If you want to go to Versillies buy a combined train and palace ticket from the RER stations (line C) it again is cheaper and you wont have to que when you get there.

There are plenty of Metro stops nearby so getting anywhere in Paris is not a problem. There are many cafes, bars, and shops in walking distance to the hotel and we particularly liked the \"No Stress Cafe\" about a half block away. Keep in mind that they only start serving food at 7:30 p.m. so before that it is only drinks and coffee. The rooms, by any standard, are absolutely tiny. The bathrooms barely have enough room for a grown man to fit and the stand-up shower allows virtually no movement once you are inside. Water pressure is good and everything was in good working order. The beds are very comfortable but if you keep your window open, you will get a tremendous amount of street noise, particularly in the waking hours of the morning. The elevator/lift was broken for about half of our stay so we were required to climb several flights of stairs to come up and down from the rooms. This didn't bother me but was a chore for my mother. We ate the breakfast downstairs one time and it was ok...primarily cereal and croissants. The WIFI internet was included in my rate but will not work anywhere other than the lobby or courtyard. The reception in the rooms is almost non-existent. If you purchase the internet access, keep this in mind. There really is some \"charm\" to this hotel and we did like it for its Paris \"feel\" and quaint location.

Secondly was the noise, on our first night there was quite a bit of street noise, also in the morning the lift was noise as the hotel was being cleaned. I\u2019d imagine this was less of a problem with a rear facing and/or higher room. However, the second night there was hardly any noise so perhaps the first night we were just unlucky.

The surrounding streets are full of reasonably priced restaurants - we particularly liked the Lebanese in rue des Martens (turn right out of the hotel, and right again) and one street is very interesting if you want to soak up watching the Parisians buying their groceries - this is also handy if you want to buy some food yourself and take it back to your room. We had a small kitchen so this came in handy and we were able to have snacks and cold drinks when we returned after long, tiring days competing with other tourists to see the wonderful sights of Paris - and being ripped off for food and drinks throughout our daytime activities! The hotel is very close to the Pigalle red light district and there were certain streets that were full of parlours - we found these entertaining to walk past in the early evening, however, did feel a little uneasy late at night but managed this without incident. Amongst all the other wonderful sights I would recommend walking up to the Sacre Coeur at night to see the wonderful views of the city and to watch the Eiffel Tower light up and become a glittering spectacle for 10 mins on the hour. Of course you need to go up quite late in the summer as it doesn't get dark until 10-11 p.m. Gorgeous though and well worth the effort. Only problem in the hotel was that the standard double room with extra bed for our son was rather squashed (there were no triples or superior doubles available) and we had to carefully pack away our huge amount of luggage so we could walk around the beds. Had a good view onto the street however and found the hotel so pleasant that the space issue became irrelevant. The numerous male reception staff were all extremely helpful, only problem was the one female staff member who was unable to comprehend how to assist me to obtain my airline's phone number. Not actually rude as such, just seemed really unintelligent! Another male receptionist, for example, went out of his way to book us the bus out to the airport and this all went very smoothly.

This one seemed to please most of its guests and had a high rating. Only reservation in our mind was that a friend had warned us not to stay near the Pigalle (red light) district, as there were some decidedly dodgy side streets around there - this seemed a little too close for comfort on the map! We needn't have worried though. Admittedly, Pigalle was very close on foot - and fascinating to walk through on your way to the Montmartre late afternoon (not so sure about after dark) but the area improved considerably as we approached St George's. It is very close to the tube station (5 minutes) and the town where there are numerous shops, bars, restaurants, pharmacies etc. The fact that it is on a quiet side road means you hear none of the noise though, even on the busy Saturday night when the very local bars seemed to really come to life. The main sights are easily accessible by tube and even on foot if you like walking. The hotel is charming, really clean and nicely laid out rooms. Our room looked very similar to that advertised. Spotless sheets and towels, clean every day. Satellite TV (limited channels but handy just the same). We even had a little kitchenette (stove & fridge) joined on to the room which was an unexpected bonus, especially as the weather was very hot when we were there so we could take out cold drinks each day. I don't think all rooms had this however. Staff very helpful. No restaurant or bar but a very small but sweet patio area and reception staff were happy to get us a coffee on arrival. Only criticism and a minor one - Had breakfast one day only and at 11 euros each, this was a bit expensive. Cafes nearby were more reasonable and perfectly adequate for a continental breakfast. Get a taxi from Gard du Nord on arrival/departure if you can afford it. Not too expensive (approx. 8 euros each way) and a bit fiddly by tube (2 changes and lots of steps) when travelling with your luggage. Mind you, we did have to queue for a taxi for about 45 minutes on arrival late on a Thursday evening. Journey to hotel - 10 minutes. A day ticket for the Seine cruise is very good value and a great way to rest your feet between seeing the sights as you can get on and off as you please and never wait more than 20 minutes for the next boat at each stop. On our last day we travelled to the St Ouen Flea Market as detailed in our travel guide. A very socially deprived and grotty area surrounded by miles of stalls selling cheap clothes and tacky souveniers. When we finally found the antiquity part (badly signposted), it was interesting, but the prices were ridiculous - not particularly recommended unless you fancy parting with 2000 euros and bringing home a moth eaten moosehead or 7 euros for a plastic Eiffel Tower. If you are a collector, take a van - its more furniture and large items than knick knacks unless we missed some of it. Booked a 'Da Vinci code' walking tour from the 'London Walks' company in London. It was excellent. English guide was knowledgable, funny and very interesting. Highly recommended. They run other tours if this one is not your cup of tea.

We couldn't have been happier with our choice. The rooms aren't large but they were more than adequate and the kitchenette was an added treat. Actually, rooms in the Hilton aren't that much larger! The hotel must have been recently modernized, and the in-room bathroom was immaculate. Air conditioner worked great and bed was comfortable (we opted for two twins as the deluxe queen rooms were taken and only doubles were left). There are flat screen TV's in the rooms but just like the Hilton, you basically get CNN and BBC chanels and not a lot more in English. Musty odor in room each time upon entry, but quickly dissapated when window was opened, AC put on, and then window closed. The decor was charming and we opted for a room with a courtyard view which definitely was quiet, but not terribly scenic. The real charm of the courtyard can be found on the main floor, and it is a wonderful place to enjoy a quiet moment in what is otherwise a lively, charming Paris district that caters to the locals and reflects their lifestyle. The differences between this location and the Eiffel Tower area can be felt everywhere, from the little shops to the slow pace of the scenic cafes. Also, you are only a stones throw from the beautiful Sacre Coeur and on the other side is the \"colorful\" ambience of Pigalle, complete with Moulin Rouge. Les Tres Poussins is beautifully decorated. The hotel does have an elevator, albeit a bit small one, and the staff were all amazingly friendly and helpful. Seriously, the four or five staff at the reception desk that spanned our six day stay were incredible. We even bought one a small gift. What a week to remember.

The metro is a quick walk but study a map as it took us a couple tries to find the quickest route.

We had reservations for a standard double room. Our room was on the first floor and we had a small kitchenette in our room which was very convenient (this must have been an upgrade). The room was nicely decorated but not luxurious. The bed was low to the ground but otherwise comfy. The bedroom and bathroom were not large but spacious enough and clean. The towels were very thin. The hotel was quiet and our room overlooked the street behind the hotel. At night, you couldn't hear anything which was nice for us jetlagged travelers. Overall, I would recommend this hotel. If you look at a map, you might think you are far from the center of the city but it is only about a 10 min metro ride to Musee D'Orsay or Arc de Triumph and other sites. Being out of the center of the city allows you to feel like you are in a less touristy area and in a real Parisian neighborhood. Also, we got a great price on expedia for the hotel (hard to say exactly becasue we got a package deal but paid probably about $120 US). Would definitely stay again and would recommend.", "Date": "February 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat a Pleasure!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4442827", "Content": "I chose the Les Trois Poussin with a Eurostar booking.

OK we were lucky with the weather. The hotel staff were all friendly helpful, spoke good English and we were able to leave our bags till 5pm on check out day. We were given a free upgrade to a room with a kitchen, not that we used it, this is Paris after all.

The hotel itself is very cute and friendly. By American standards, the room was small, but we found it very comfortable. The furniture and bath were in good condition, and the cleaning service was very good. The room had a small flat screen tv and built-in writing able. We stayed in room 501, facing the street. The street is a residential one. Attached are pictures of the view. The room was sound-proof and comfortable. The front desk was helpful and gracious. They helped me get my luggage to the hotel when my luggage came on a later flight than mine. My only complaint was that after four nights, the bed developped a small valley in the center. We booked through Expedia (via TripAdvisor) and received a stay 3 nights, receive 1 night free deal. This averaged to ~$120/night... all in all a very good deal. A few notes on food: *There is a wonderful, small creperie up the street no more than one block up the hill past the hotel... I think that the name is Ble Noir (picture a shaft of wheat). It's great for a late breakfast or a lighter lunch. The ham and cheese (jambon et frommage) crepe was really good. *Also on Rue de Martyrs (#91 maybe?), ~10 minutes walk from the hotel, there is a tasty Hungarian Restaurant. For ~20 euros, you can get a three course meal with a cocktail to start and a shot of vodka to finish. A really nice way to warm up after a cold day on the town. *When you're farther downtown sight-seeing, Leon's of Belgium is a nice stop. They are a chain, and there is even one off of the Pigalle stop. You can get a fantastic bucket of mussels, a never-ending supply of french fries, and glass of cool Belgian beer... so good! *Also Flam's is a fun Belgian version of Pizza Hut. The pizzas are ultra thin, and don't have tomato sauce. The toppings can be creative, and are really tasty. *Finally the Latin Quarter, a few steps from Notre Dame, has tiny streets, and is packed with restaurants. At night the area is very lively and is filled with students from the nearby universities and tourists alike. There lots of tasty fondue restaurants. Try the tartiflette (spelling?)to warm you up... it's a casserole of thinnly sliced potatoes, large chunks of bacon, and melted cheese. A comment on Pigalle... the earlier comments are correct. Trois Poussins is in between 2 metro lines, St Georges and Pigalle. You can completely avoid Pigalle by taking the metro at St Georges. Pigalle itself is not that bad. There are sex stores around, but not graphic images. It's in a completely safe, well-maintained neighborhood and I never felt unsafe or not at ease. At night you can see ladies in the bars waiting for clients. Other than that it's all ok. I'd recommend the Trois Poussin for a short stay in Paris. The hotel was very nice, and it was great to be in a quiet, non-touristy, residential street... after a few days, it almost felt like we had lived in Paris for a long time.
