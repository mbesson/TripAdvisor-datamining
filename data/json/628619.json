The fact that I could not wait another second to write this review should show just how horrible and shady this place is. The Sofia hotel is something like a boutique hotel which has masked its lack of customer service and shady business ethics with decent lookin decor and overly scented rooms (probably to cover up some Sort of foul odor). As of February 20th, 2012 this hotel is basically right next to a construction site. If i were to look out the window, there is literally a guy with a jackhammer standing about 5 feet from me. It is definately not a great feeling to wake up after a night out in San Diego, to the sounds of what can only be described as a World War 2 reenactment at 9AM. What really turned me off was the fact that I (or anything of the 3 travelers I checked in with) , received no warning from ANY of the staff when we were checking in. When I notified the front desk, I was told that my complaint would be forwarded to management and that there was basically nothing they could do because I had already paid for the room. Basically...\" we're take your complaint seriously but we already have your money so thanks for letting us know how you feel\". Here's the kicker...this place is independently owned and operated! Which is probably one of the biggest reasons why i decided to stay here, thinking that there customer service would be unmatched. Don't be fooled though, the way my complaint was handled...the Sofia hotel might as well be another corporate machine. Also the rooms do appear to seem clean but my opinion was quickly changed when I found myself standing in a shower with a clogged drain.

The hotel is well located only a short walk to the USS Midway and harbor and opposite direction to the Horton Plaza. About 5 blocks from the Gas Lamp area. On site restaurant is not open for breakfast during the week but there are other choices within blocks. The Transit Store is across the street so it is very easy to buy a transit pass (good for the bus and trolleys), obtain maps and route guides. The Westgate and Westin hotels are a block away.

From the moment we pulled up to the Sofia Hotel, where we were greeted curbside by a friendly valet, the charming mix of old and new was abundant. Born of a $16 million renovation of San Diego\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s historic Pickwick Hotel, the Sofia Hotel has an exceptionally decorated lobby with classic, old world charm and a smartly-dressed staff who were pleasant, helpful and efficient. Check-in was very smooth and in no time we were settling into our room. The spacious room offered a living room complete with couch, chairs, desk, table, drawers, and a television. Efficiently designed and comfortably appointed with a chic tone, the luxuries were in the detail. Our suite had an updated, modern bathrooms with a unique layout in that the sink and counter were in the throughway to the bedroom, opposite a shower and toilet chamber enclosed by a space-saving sliding door. Fine linen, with plush pillows made for a comfortable night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rest. Gilchrist & Soames spa products and toiletries made even quick showers a delightful experience. The suite also included a microwave and a miniature fridge that came in handy during our four-day stay. The bedroom also had a television as well as a safe for storage of valuables. While the TVs were a bit smaller then in some other hotels they offered a wide range of channels including both free and on-demand movie channels and local information channels. Dining options were abundant as not only did the hotel offer its own bar and restaurant, the Currant Brasserie, but there were numerous restaurants as well as shopping options within an easy walk of the hotel. The Currant has been rated the best French Bistro in town and each evening offers and amazing specialty popcorn. I had expected it to be simply new seasonings and was happy to experience, meat, cheese, and other delights when it arrived. The hotel also offers spa services and the 24-hour Harkishan Yoga Studio and Health Center provides yoga mats and surround sound system and an on-call yoga instructor is available. The pet-friendly hotel also partners with Dogs and the City to offer pet care services such as grooming or in-room pet sitting. I strongly suggest taking advantage of the local area station on the in room cable service as I learned about some great venues in the area as well as a famous pancake resturant which has garnered national praise. While parking downtown can be a bit of an issue the Sofia offers valet parking at $30 a day. The valet service was extremely efficient and helpful and a couple of times provided directions that were even better than our GPS could provide. There are also numerous lots in the surrounding blocks which offer numerous options for guests. The hotel charges a resort fee of $12.00 per day which includes complementary Internet access as well as other amenities such as bottled water. Since this was a working trip, I was extremely grateful to have reliable access to the Internet and a comfy room in which to unwind after an extremely long day in a city that offers countless activities. Sadly our time went by very quickly but we were given and very friendly and prompt check out, and the reception desk even offered us coupons to a local dining facility. From a great room and very friendly staff, we cannot wait for a return visit to this charming hotel.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel stay EVER!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "euexplorer", "ReviewID": "UR121421014", "Content": "I decided to treat myself to a 4 star after a 20 hour trip to San Diego.

My view consisted of a wall 6 feet opposite my window so you can imagine the amount of natural light I got. However I am not picky and the only thing that really matters to me is the ability to get a good nights sleep.

First, I could hear people outside in the hallways throughout the night. I'd characterize the hotel guests as relatively young overall so there were people who were heading out for the night and yelling about taking shots when we were trying to fall asleep. (I probably should've asked them for a shot, it could have helped me sleep.) Second, the hotel is located next to or near a fire station so you can hear the sirens of the fire trucks when they're called out in the night. Third, I found I could hear the guests in the room next door in the morning when they were speaking to one another. Not ideal. My final issue was the silly shower situation: yes it's a lovely shower with pretty tile, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. But I have a feeling the folks who designed the shower stalls decided to keep the shower space open (the glass doesn't fully enclose the shower) for aesthetic reasons and to make the space seem larger.

The location of the hotel was in great walking distance to shopping, the Gaslamp Quarter and to the harbor. The hotel staff and conceirge were helpful and pleasant. Actually, I ended up with a stain on my white pants and enquired about the use/purchase of a stain remover and the Conceirge went into his own backpack to give me his own Tide stain stick! This worked perfectly and I was eternally grateful to save my new pants. Little things like this mean a lot. We had booked the queen size bed suite as we felt we would love the extra space for the week long stay- which was a fantastic idea! Although we faced the street the sleeping quarters was at the back of the room, reducing the amount of noise. Fortunately we are sound sleepers and I could imagine light sleepers finding it somewhat disruptive with the numerous sirens that were heard throughout the day and night. The room had a mini fridge and microwave which came in handy when we aquired leftovers from a fantastic Indian food restaurant in the Gaslamp Quarter. They not only had bottled water replaced everyday, and a coffee maker, they had a bottle of white and red wine to use (you were charged when you opened it). This was extrememly enjoyable to have after a long day of sight-seeing and we managed to use 3! The bedding was soooo comfortable and the towels were plentiful. The bathroom design was interesting with the toilet and shower/bathtub in 1 room and the sink, towels and outlet were in an annex between the sitting and bedroom. They supplied a blowdryer- which I didn't use as I always bring my own. They had pretty good drawer space for us to unpack our clothing, with a small but adequate closet with iron and small ironing board. There were 2 TVs (bedroom and sitting room) and a small desk. The only complaint (from my husband) was the internet service-especially as he needed it for work and the reason for the business part of this trip. Although they had a restaurant on the main floor of the hotel they was no affliated cafe but there was a fantastic coffee place (the Coffee Bean) right next door that was open at 5am. My husband (the early riser!) would go there for 6am read and use their wi-fi and drink his coffee on their patio then bring my coffee to the room by 8am. The restaurant on the main floor (The Current) was not a hit as the menu was limited and they weren't open for breakfast.There was a Greyound bus depot on the other side of the hotel which was surprising how \"tucked away\" it was, and as well as the travellers- traffic was not excessive. Beside the depot was a Pizza Hut express which we took advantage of on our first night when we were too tired to go \"out\" to eat and could munch in our room. We either walked or used the transit system (both bus and train) which we found easy and convenient for most of the sights took in (San Diego zoo and Seaworld). Our only complaint with the Tourism was that although they had good wine tours advertised there was no way to get to these wineries unless you rented a car or limo- which was unreasonably priced for that 1 event. Airport transportation- we had taken a van taxi from the airport to the the hotel which was $8 per person but found that the taxi we took from the hotel to the airport was cheaper at $12 for both of us.

It's away from the hubbub of the convention center (where you invariably run into someone after convention hours) has been nicely refurbished in a sort of contemporary Art Deco style, has a friendly, courteous staff (except for one guy, Kleeber, who ought to be in the backroom and NOT dealing with customers). The rooms are small. After all, it's a hotel built in, what, the 1930s? But they make optimal use of the layout using sliding doors and compact cabinets. As with everyone else, I think $30 is a lot to pay for parking...and then I think of how much it is to park in downtown San Francisco...and then I shrug my shoulders. So I figure, we are in downtown San Diego. The valets are VERY helpful. I needed stuff form my car several times the first day and they were cheerful and prompt. I wasn't crazy about the food at the Currant restaurant but that may be because I'm not a fan of sauces on my food: the savory sauce on my calamari obscured the taste of the calamari, which is what I wanted to taste. The steak sandwich had a bernaise-like sauce (I think) that hid the essence of the steak. But that's more personal preference on my part. Kleeber...such a dude, especially when compared to the service orientation of his colleagues (like Assistant Manager McClain, Brian and the concierge, whose name I've forgotten). I woke up at 4:30 am the first day, found that I forgot my razor. I went downstairs to ask for one. Two desk people were there. Kleeber, who was looking at his screen (and never looked up)and another desk person, who was helping two people. It was ONLY when the busy desk person asked Kleeber to help me that Kleeber looked up from his screen. (Yep, Kleeber, can't lose those google searches or whatever you were looking at on the screen, even when you are on the clock, huh?) I asked Kleeber for a razor. He looked, then said they ran out. I asked him what I could do. He said I could go to the 7-11 and buy one. That's when I looked at his name badge, said it aloud and started walking away. Then, knowing I was annoyed, he said that they could go to the 7-11 and get one for me. I replied saying that that was a good answer since the hotel info binder said they had spare razors and such for forgetful people like me. (Turns out the 7-11 didn't sell them, so management sure has to get some spares in.) I don't fault the desk people for no having a razor available. That's management's job. But someone with Kleeber's service attitude really should not be dealing with the paying public. I'll surely stay at the Sofia the next time I am in San Diego but I'll do two things: be sure I have a razor and, if Kleeber is still on the desk, wait for someone else to help me.

The rooms are painfully small and all have double beds. For a guy who's 6' 4\" [192 cm] and shares a bed, this is not an equation that has a happy ending! At least my 9 yo daughter was happy with her 'solo' bed... The sink is right in your room; the shower lacks a full door and floods the floor and 3 people have absolutely NO ROOM TO MOVE IN THEIR ROOM! Parking is at a premium around the property, so be prepared to pony up 30 bucks a day plus tips for valet service. Also, the San Diego City lockup is right next-door [in behind on Front Street], so walking around this hotel after-hours with kids IS NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!! Plus, the hotel dings you with a 9 dollar a day incidental charge that covers such things as internet access, in-room coffee/tea, and water.

Like other visitors have mentioned the rooms are very small. There's just enough space for your luggage and not much else. However my problem was with the cleanliness. On arrival to our room, I noticed that there was a yellow stain on the toilet seat. The toilet seat was also very worn and there was brown material showing through, which made it seem even more unappealing. As I was exhausted after a long day of travelling, I couldn't be bothered complaining so I wiped the stain off myself. A few nights in, the toilet started leaking, which was rather disturbing. The other gripe that I have with the Sofia Hotel is the fact that there was a Guest Service fee of sorts which was not made clear to me at all. It was not mentioned upon booking, nor by staff when checking in, or in any of the brochures or information booklet provided by the hotel. I happily paid a similar fee at the MGM Grand, as this was made clear multiple times. Upon checking out of the Sofia, we were slapped by this unexpected fee which left a bitter taste in my mouth, and we were unaware of the fact that we were paying for these \"amenities\" hence we never took advantage of them. The Sofia Hotel is centrally located, and the San Diego Zoo is a short bus ride away. The Greyhound terminal is next door which means there are some sketchy characters hanging around at all times of day, but which is pretty handy if you're planning on taking the bus. The Gaslamp District, waterfront and Horton Plaza shopping mall are nearby. The attached restaurant, Currant, is also pretty nice. However, due to the poor housekeeping and unexpected service fee, I will NOT be recommending the Sofia Hotel.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience\u201d", "Author": "jhonny-69", "ReviewID": "UR97526115", "Content": "Traveling with a colleague to a Meeting.

The representative at the registration desk, Gabriella tells me that she hasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t received any online bookings all day so she probably couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help me. I was a bit stunned by that comment but I proceeded to tell her my name and show her my Perfect Escapes confirmation on my iPhone. She tells me that she didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care about that and pointed towards the business center. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Go and print me a hard copy and then come back here.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Again, I was stunned and asked her, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am giving you my name, I am showing you the confirmation and yet, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking me to go and print out the confirmation or you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to help me?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd She said yes.

The printer was out of ink. I went back to Gabriella and told her that the ink was out and she proceeded to yell loudly across to the other side of the lobby to tell a bellman that the printer was broken. The bellman started to laugh at me and says to me \u00e2\u20ac\u0153what?, can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t print something?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The bellman slouches way back in the chair and starts printing off sheets and cavalierly hands them to me. They were blank, obviously from the lack of ink. I had to show them back to him so that he could see that they were blank. He yells out of the business center back to Gabriella and says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153just book him a room!\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Gabriella starts to book a room but now wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at me. I tell her that Perfect Escapes lists a late checkout and ask her if she is going to honor it. Gabriella sighs and said I should be charging you more but I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll do it anyway and sarcastically says, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153for all your inconvenience\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Gabriella still doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t offer up any apology and still won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look me in the eye. I had never been so close to having my girlfriend and I jump back in my car and take our chances finding a new place. Next time, I will go with my instincts\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Now back to the fun. The elevator was extremely small. At most, it would fit 4-5 people and we see a couple struggling to get their baby stroller inside. We wait for the next car. Once in the elevator, we notice the odd d\u00c3\u00a9cor. Strange vinyl laminate on the floor of a picture of rocks mixed with old wood paneling on the walls. The door on the elevator closes and the elevator jerks and drops suddenly. It gets us to our floor and we quickly get out. We nervously laugh and call it the Bates Motel and both assure ourselves that it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get any worse. We get to our room and one of the keys isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t programmed properly. Luckily we had a second key that did work or I was dreading another visit to Gabriella, aka \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Miss Congeniality\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. The room is extremely small. So small that you see a sink as soon as you open the door. We walk in and we see the smallest flat screen TV that we have ever seen. Maybe a diameter of 14\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. We joke and say it helps to make the room look bigger. We open the curtains and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our city view\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the old Grayhound Bus terminal. I tried to turn on the light next to the bed but it was burned out. My girlfriend goes into the bathroom and the toilet wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t flush properly. One had to hold it down until the cycle was completely done. The kicker was the size of the bathroom. The bathroom was so small that there was no bathtub, the shower length was only about 5 feet and they couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t install a door on the shower as there wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be enough room to open outwards. Instead they had a half glass wall on the left-hand side. The problem with this design was that the shower knobs were on the right side and the shower head was on the left, so when one turns on the water, the stream would hit you in the face and body if you wanted to warm up the shower while you were getting undressed. In addition, with only a half glass wall on the left-hand side, the showerhead would shoot the water out onto the floor of the bathroom and would pour into our hallway. Would never stay there again and obviously, I am taking the time to write this lengthy review to warn others about the Sophia Hotel.

I went to San Diego to conduct research for graduate school and usually by the end of the week I'm ready to go home. But i had such a wonderful experience at the Sofia that the week breezed by. Reasons why I enjoyed it so much: 1) The staff: The first night I checked in, the front desk staff asked me what brought me to town and how they could be of assistance during my stay. The days following as I passed by the front desk I was greeted by name and asked how my research was going, how my stay was, etc. They provided me with maps of the area, restaurant recommendations, scenic routes for my morning runs, and directions. They were extremely attentive. The housekeeping staff did a wonderful job. No complaints there. 2) The room: Yes, they are small but this is a boutique hotel--not a Sheraton or Marriott. But, for a solo traveler (and even if I traveled with my spouse) the room was big enough for what I needed. Didn't spend a lot of time in the room. The bed: one of the most comfortable I've slept in--soft sheets, extra pillows, duvet. Bathroom: rainhead shower, large, soft towels, above-counter sink (spa-like atmosphere), lighted make-up mirror (Huge plus!). Wireless connection (daily fee), desk, comfy chair, bottles of water, fridge and microwave. Everything I needed. 3) Restaurant: Currant Brasserie is connected to The Sofia and I ate there three out of six nights (better food and deal than the restaurants around the gaslamp quarter). Their happy hour specials are a very good deal (1/2 price burgers, appetizers, etc) and I met a number of locals who eat there for their delicious food. Great wait staff. 4) Location: One block from great shopping at Horton Plaza, Gaslamp Quarter, minutes from the water, coffee shop right outside the hotel. I felt very safe walking around at night by myself. 5) Fitness Center: May not be a big deal to some, but I work out every day and their fitness center was very nice: medicine balls, bosu, weight machines, treadmills with TVs, and a separate yoga studio. There were dvds, mats, and all the yoga equipment in the studio to have your own yoga session. But running alongside the water in the morning is quite beautiful...

The hotel itself is very modern and hipster in feel and ambiance. The lobby and ajoining restaurant are quite plush and inviting. The location is great. In San Diego, when choosing to stay downtown then assuming you want some nightlife and a bit of a scene then you really should stay near or within the Gaslamp Quarter. This is basically a 16 block radius of restaurants, bars, shops and nightclubs. The Sofia is just on the fringes of it and thus offers the best of both worlds: close enough to walk to and from your night out but just far enough away that the noise from the local establishments won't keep you up until the wee hours if you have planned on having an early night. In terms of location, the Sofia is in a better location than the similarly priced Gaslamp Plaza Suites which I stayed at in 2009 and have previously posted a review for. Some people have commented on the Sofia's proximity to the Greyhound Bus Depo and the problems this causes in relation to the close proximity to the many homeless in SD... I encountered no problems with this and both my wife and I felt perfectly safe walking about at night... Sure you will have some encounters but to be honest the homeless problem in downtown SD is so noticable that you would have issues with it regardless of where you stayed. The front desk and concierge were very helpful. As an example, they allowed us to borrow 2 bikes free of charge to take and cycle arounfdCoronado Island for the day. The gym and Yoga studio wereideal and allowed us both to get our morning workouts in before breakfast. Special mention for the lemon infused water that was freely available throughout the hotel and in the gym, seriously refreshing. The only downside, and its kinda a big one, was the acual size of the room. It was painfully small and by the end of the 6 nights it was becoming more and more of an issue. Don't get me wrong, they have made a great use of the space afforded to each room but that does not deflect from the fact that, even just with the 2 of us... it was cramped. In this regard, the aforementioned Gaslamp Plaza Suites rooms were far more appealing.

LOCATION : (Rating : EXCELLENT) Prior to our finally selecting this hotel, I had some misgivings about the \"homeless\" and security of both the area and this hotel from reading reviews and am glad we went with our gut feel and booked it anyway. It's definitely downtown making it very convenient to catch the local bus, train and trolley to most of the sights. About a block away is the Horton Plaza, which, if you went to San Diego to shop would be good (not us) , restaurant outlets and other shops. The most convenience to us, however, was the Ralph's Supermarket across Horton Plaza (or about 2-3 blocks from the Sofia). There was a 7-Eleven nearer the hotel but the price and selection was far better at Ralph's. There was a review that mentioned security of this area because of jail/bondsmen offices in the area but frankly, it was never an issue with me, considering I was mostly by myself for 3 days while my husband was attending a conference. As common sense dictates, awareness and care ought to be taken anywhere and everywhere. ACCOMMODATIONS : (Rating : ABOVE AVERAGE) For it's class and it's historic background, the Sofia is well beyond it's worth. Granted that the room is indeed cozy (small-ish) that having both my husband and I walking past each other by the bed and the entertainment center was a squeeze, still it packed in everything else we could ever ask for... a microwave, and refrigerator, which is not normally available in most hotel rooms but which definitely made our stay more worthwhile. And a \"MUST\" to our hotel choice always....a coffeemaker, which in the Sofia, is a definite perk with the Cuisineart coffee, which I have to admit was a first taste for me and I found them almost as good as Starbucks. The water pressure was never a problem. The only 2 negatives (which would have made my accommodation rating excellent) was one, the shower configuration. The glass enlosure was only half the shower stall that water was everywhere after a shower. Second, would be lack of soap dish by the counnter/wash area . The above-the-counter glass bowl/basin was aesthetically pleasing and trendy but once used, the handsoap just had no place to stay as it just kept sliiping into the bowl. On our first 3 days, we used a plastic bag to lay the handsoap on so as not to ruin the beautiful counter. Thankfully, on our 4th day, there was a Sofia coaster provided for by the cleaning lady that day. Of course, it was totally soaked before the night was over . Very simple remedy that I am sure the Sofia will look into and provide for for future guests. The linens and pillows were very comfortable . Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the Courthouse. Noise was not a problem, the A/C was simply divine as it was the 80s and 90s in the days we were there. The ice-machine was also in the 4th floor, another big convenience! Other-in-room amenities: Iron / ironing board Radio / Ipod dock (the added feature of the \"white noise\" option was great) Hairdryer Toiletries was excellent (soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion and mouthwash) AMENITIES: (Rating: EXCELLENT for it's class) For clarification, my rating is based on those we have experienced and therefore, would not speak for The Currant\", the hotel's retaurant as we unfortunately, did not have the privilege of dining there. However, based on how it looked and how it was really packed most lunches and evenings we were there, it probably is notable, too. The other hotel amenities worth mentioning are the Ice-machines on designated floors, the business center, which was conveneiently located in the lobby, the bikes and helmets offered FREE for hotel guests from dusk and the walking tour on Sundays. SERVICE : (Rating : EXCELLENT) Special kudos to the Front Desk staff (check-in date was 10/30). As guests not only in the hotel but to city as well, it was quite refreshing to find hotel staff very amiable and not just work-driven to help out guests like us for directions and information. I would also like to make special mention of the housekeeping staff. SImply superb! A minor note, there was indeed an additional daily fee of about $ 2.97 (or thereabouts) for historical preserevation cost upon our check-out . Though, this was not really a problem nor was the cost, it indeed would be better if it is understood clearly on their website or added to costs if booked on other sites. Overall, it should not deter anyone from choosing this hotel.

There is also a train station just two blocks from the hotel, so you can take a train to Old Town and the downtown areas if you don't want to walk (although it was called a \"trolley\" which makes it sound kind of quaint and old-world-style; it was really just a light rail, and when I was on it at night there were certainly some strange characters on with me). The rooms are fantastic; yes they are smaller than some hotels I have stayed in because it's a historical building and rooms were smaller when it was built, but come on people, you're in San Diego! Why are you hanging out in your rooms anyway? People who are worried about the size of their rooms should get out and DO something instead of hanging around all day in a hotel. They also have the added bonus of a mini fridge and a microwave, so I was able to save the leftovers from my favorite California restaurant (Vince's Spaghetti) and eat them the next day. The parking was $30 a night, but it was the same for pretty much all the hotels I looked at in the downtown area, so it's not outrageously high here versus other places.

When we arrived the room was nice enough. They make the most of what little space the room has. The location is about 2-3 blocks away from the Gaslamp Quarter. I live in San Diego and I wouldn't consider the location ideal. Two blocks away is the county jail and all the bail bonds offices that come along with it. They only offer valet parking which at $30/night is very steep. Our first night in the room we were getting ready to meet up with some friends for dinner in the Gaslamp. As I was waiting for my girflriend to get ready I spotted a cockroach crawling across the wall. I called down to the front desk immediately and they informed they would send someone up to take care of it. About ten minutes later a maintenance man came with a bottle of insecticide. At this point the cockroach was in our curtains. He saw it and sprayed away but never did catch it or confirm its demise. Somehow the roach had gotten away. His response was \"that should take care of it\". Great, not only does the room now reek of insecticide but there's still the possibility there's a roach in the room somewhere. Anyway, I called down to the front desk again requesting another room. At first they said the hotel was sold out but they somehow managed to find us another room. Someone from the front desk came up to our room and gave us the keys to our new room as well as a couple of breakfast vouchers. We had to pack up again and move to another room. At this point we were about 30 minutes late in meeting our friends. In the end we never did use those breakfast vouchers. My girlfriend and I just weren't comfortable eating somewhere where we knew there were cockroaches. We ended up checking out one day early. I tried to recoup the rate for the night we weren't staying at the hotel as I prepaid for the room using Expedia but the gentleman at the front desk said he couldn't do that but gave me the business card of their front office manager to contact. I sent an email out to Kristi, the front office manager, voicing my displeasure and haven't received any kind of acknowledgement. By the way, the room with the cockroach was room 329.

We have stayed at the Omni and Hotel Solomar, which are our usual favorites. I know they are a higher class hotel than the Sofia, but with all the rave reviews we figured we wouldn't be sacrificing much, so we took a chance a booked the Sofia. We found an amazing deal through GetaRoom.com. For only $50 a night during Memorial Day weekend we didn't think we had anything to lose, but boy did we! First of all this hotel is right next to a Grey Hound Bus station, numerous bail bondsman's, and many many many bums. Usually this doesn't bother me in downtown San Diego, but this time it did, because this seems to be where they convene. When we pulled up the valet, which costs $30 per day, informed us the onsite parking garage was full and that our car would be parked three blocks away. Normally this wouldn't bother me, except that the neighborhood was so bad I found it unsettling. Again, my husband and I choose to stay downtown for the restaurants and night life. We walk around at night and I usually feel very safe, but I did not feel safe at the Sofia when I first arrived and I hoped this would be changed by the Zen like atmosphere that they advertise. All the staff at the hotel is very friendly and very professional. They act like they work at a nicer hotel than they do. A gentleman carried our bags in from the front door to the desk and the desk clerk was very hospitable. We asked for a room with a view if possible, but were told since we booked for 4 nights, there were none available. The lobby is very nice and well decorated, but it still has some of the hotel's classic charm. At this point my anxiety dropped slightly and I tried to have more of an open mind; however, that changed once we got into the elevators. They are so small if you have luggage and someone else is in there, wait for the next one and hope it's empty. This made me VERY nervous about the rooms and I had every right to be. If the elevators and hallways are compact, you better believe the rooms are. When we opened the door to our single queen room, I was horribly disappointed. The queen bed was the smallest queen I have ever laid eyes on. It literally took up all of the hotel room. The windows were covered with what looked like chicken wire (I guess to keep off the pigeon poop) and they didn't open, which was very needed in such a small space. Our room faced a parking lot for a Criminal Law office, not very San Diego like, and the room was not prepared very well for guests. The air wasn't on and it was incredibly stuffy (it took an hour to cool down), the tables were dusty, and the floor was dirty. The shower was a joke. Not at all feasible for such a small space. While it's pretty to look at, it floods the floor of this tiny bathroom that you can barely turn around in. I'm not sure about the square footage, but I would say these rooms are 200-250 SQ feet. I have stayed in bigger rooms in NYC and Seattle. They allow pets, but I don't know how a guest and Fido could fit comfortably in that room. In the end we ate the $250 and booked a room in Torrey Hills at the Hilton Garden Inn, which was a normal, clean, and comfortable hotel. I have never left a an already booked hotel in my life, but the Sofia was that unsatisfactory. If you're going to downtown San Diego to party and don't really care where you are sleeping this is the hotel for you; however, if you are looking for a relaxing San Diego vacation look elsewhere. Especially when the rates for this place go up this summer.

I booked this hotel at half the price and I feel that is what I got. I was there for a conference and decided that this hotel was suitable, since it was 4 blocks from the convention site. When I arrived at the airport I had to find another way to get to the Sofia (they provide no shuttle service). I checked into my room and the person who took care of me was very pleasant, but she forgot to return my credit card, my ID and didn't properly magnetize my room key. Which meant I had to make a double trip downstairs. She was nice enough to provide me with extra maps and directions. This doesn't really count as a negative toward this review. After I got into my room, I was surprised how big the bathroom was. But this might be due to the room being a corner room. The room was very clean, well decorated and comfortable. I had a small flat screen TV, with basic and some cable channels. The bathroom was stocked with towels and shampoo/soap. They had a working fridge with microwave and the bed was very comfy. The sheets were clean and the comforter was puffy and soft. I was really happy upon entering (the positive). Then I found out that internet was 9.95 a day, but it's free in the lobby. Which would explain why everyone was downstairs with their computers. Bummer. Considering my friends at the Best Western across the street had it in their room for FREE. My first night was pleasant , until 7am the next morning. You see, the Sofia is located next to the Greyhound station and because my room is located right next to the station, I could hear the buses coming and going at 7am! So if you want to sleep in late, tell them you DO NOT want to face the Greyhound station. Lucky for me, I had to get up by that time for the conference (the negative). The hotel is located really close to the Horton Mall, which is great if you forget anything! They also provide massages and yoga, which is great to relax in your hotel.

Since The Sofia is smack-dab in the middle of downtown and there are no other parking facilities that I would suggest to ensure your cars safety. Checking in was a breeze and after seeing the amount of luggage we had, the bellhop suggested we upgrade to a suite. Because we got such a great rate by booking directly with the hotel (less than $70 per night) we decided to upgrade for an additonal $30 per night. At this rate, we were still ahead of comparable hotels in the area. Arriving in the room, we were glad we decided to upgrade. Yes, the rooms are \"cozy\", but the feel of the suite gave our 19-month old son more room to play. Without the upgrade, it would have been too cramped. The Sofia may be best for those singles traveling on business or for the couple who are only staying one or two nights. The business center (read: room) allowed for a quick check of the email. Wireless is not available in the room and the rate is $10 per day. Use the business room if you don't plan on putting this overpriced charge on your expense account. The bed was very comfortable, albeit a Queen, and the decor added a nice touch. Especially the microwave and mini-fridge which is a must when traveling with a toddler. The towels were above average for hotel quality. We did not eat at Currant, but there are plenty food options nearby. The hotel is near a bus terminal with many vagrants about, but do not let this change your mind about staying at The Sofia. Travel to the Zoo, La Jolla, Tijuana, were all within 20 minute drive.

We were really only in the room to sleep so the smallness was not an issue. The room had an ipod docking clock by the bed, wine glasses, glass coffee mugs, wine opener, microwave, refrigerator, and coffeepot. We did buy a bottle of wine and some cheese to enjoy in the room before dinner and was nice to have a place to keep them cold. The pillows on the bed are pretty big (full) but after the first night I called the front desk and asked for some smaller, less stuffed ones, and they brought some right up. I used the fitness center one morning. It had a couple of treadmills, elipiticals, some machines, and free weights. There is also an attached \"yoga\" room. There is a restaurant/bar in the hotel \"Current\" that we had drinks at a couple of times, and hubby had breakfast there. There is also a coffee shop in the corner of the hotel. 7 Eleven is just down the street if you want a less expensive cup of coffee and budget breakfast. The walk to the convention center was easy as was the walk to all the fabulous restaurants in the Gaslamp area. (We were not bothered by any homless people.) We really enjoyed Fred's Mexican Cafe - Taco Tuesdays are cheap margaritas and EXCELLENT fish (an other) tacos. Also went to Donovans- wonderful steaks and if you call they will pick you up and take you back to hotel in their very luxerious van, and Blue Point for great seafood.

When I found it online, I was a bit concerned I'd end up experiencing a boutique which was trying to be trendy and hip and not simply cozy and comfortable like I was hoping. Boy, were my slight concerns in this regard unwarranted, I am so happy to say. What I found out was that the staff, atmosphere, amenities and overall feel were outstanding and wonderful and make me want to go back soon! Let me share a few details and try to paint the picture as to why I liked it so much. There is much about which I'd like to elaborate, but I'll try to summarize as succienctly as I am able. Before I even committed to booking my room on the phone (and trust me, its worth it to do this rather than simply take the best rate you can find online), I found such helpfulness from the young lady named Amanda in explaining the rooms and rates available. She was so friendly and extremely patient with my many questions and attempts to find a way to reduce the rate just a bit more than what I found online. She was able to do so after I coaxed her just enough, but she never once made me feel I was keeping her too long. Next, on the night of my arrival, I was treated to such a wonderful welcome and very effecient service by Selma at the front desk. She made me feel I was being hosted by a friendly aquaintance, not just another hotel employee \"doing the job\" with here genuinely warm and friendly manner. She anticipated my needs and had helped me on the phone before arrival by reading off menu items from the Currant Restaurant on property and had my food prepared and waiting when I arrived to check in! This was her suggestion on the phone when she realized I was running late and might miss a late dinner when I mentioned I was hungry and figuring out options. She also assisted me with parking ideas and introduced me to the bellman Daniel, who was also extremely friendly and helpful while I ate before getting back to my vehicle to park it. During my stay, Autumn at the desk was also such a peach and a friendly assistant. She printed off directions to Coronado while I was gabbing away with Selma again and then the next day acted as my bellperson and check out host at the same time while the other bellman was at lunch. She was so cheeful, patient and an enjoyable person with whom to converse and I still can see her bright smile in my mind. Kudos to Christian the dest manager, too, as he was helpful, effiecient and friendly as well! If you have not already figured it out, the staff is perhaps my favorit thing about the hotel. But let me say a bit more about the facility itself. For the money you pay, which is reasonable already, you get a nice fitness center and useful computers and printer at the business center. The feeling all around hotel is clean, cozy and relaxed. The atmosphere is charming. The furnishings are contemporary and comfortable. I did like the room, although it was pretty small, but I knew that coming in and could have paid more for a larger suite. However, the room had everything you need including a small fridge, microwave, flat screen TV and even extra wine, beer and coffee glasses which were real glass, not plastic or cheap. The beds are divine - so very comfortable. The sleep cover and top sheet were a bit short for a queen bed in my opinion and at only 6' tall, my feet stuck out a bit. But the housekeeping staff gave me a king size the next day which helped. The one thing which was really strange about the room was the shower set up, which is common in many of the rooms. It has no door or curtain, so water goes all over the floor and toilet area, which makes a mess to dry up. However, I just asked for more towles and put them down the next time. I'd rather not have to do it, after falling in love with other aspects of the hotel I would put up with it again. Anyone looking to stay here must realize the benefits and challenges of the location. You are pretty centrally located downtown and other parts of the city are easily accessible by car or public transporation. It's in an area focused on business as much as tourism. However, there are nice restaurants nearby in the Gaslamp area and even just in the general blocks not far away. The food I had at the Currant restaurant in the hotel was pretty good, but I need to eat there more to give it a real review. I must say my waiter was very hard working and accomodated all of my detalied requests happily. But the biggest challenge downtown is parking. You either have to find a pay lot, run back and forth to meters in the daytime, or pay $28 for valet parking at the hotel. I was trying to save money for other activities, so I used a pay lot about 5 blocks away and had to go back and forth a few times to make sure I was not ticketed. But it was only $3-5 and mostly overnight, as I was out and doing things in the daytime. So, just know what you are getting into and then make your choice. I'm giving it 5 stars because I'm extremely happy with my stay overall. Perhaps I'd give it 4.5 if I could, only because I think it's only fair to point out the few small things I'd prefer were different like the shower set up and the parking costs/hassle. However, knowing those things going in now, I'd still stay there anytime.

I was staying at Holiday Inn on The Bay and they wanted to charge me $150 which I could of stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel! I would have stayed at the Hard Rock but since this was not a plan to stay the extra two days I opted for the cheaper room. They were very nice and the place was really cute! It is a historical hotel so it has little touches of classic architechture but they modernized it. The room was really tiny. I don't mind that but some people might. They had a microwave and refrigerator. The bed was sooo comfortable!!! The only thing I didn't like was that the shower only had one glass door and it didn't slide which meant the water got on the bathroom floor. They have a nice business area with three computers and no time limit. There is a restaurant attached to it. It has gotten great reviews. My boyfriend and I were too late for dinner so we ate the bar menu which was pretty tasty. It is a little on the pricey side because it is an upscale restaurant but I have a feeling it would be worth it. They also have a gym and yoga room but I didn't partake in either.

I looked into how much it would have been to stay if we paid regular price and it was only $25-$40 more per night to stay at one of the hotels right in the Gaslamp. It was our first time to San Diego and we were pleasantly surprised to get door to door from the airport to the Sofia in just about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, as we came up the street we noticed the San Diego Court building a block and a half away, and the city jail one block away. We had a lovely view of two different bail bond locations next door from our room. That coupled with the bus station on the other side of the hotel and all of the people milling around outside made us too uncomfortable to walk anywhere from the hotel. We are from Chicago and used to city life, but this was pretty seedy. The doorman at the hotel was lovely and super helpful, as well as the front desk staff. The front desk man quickly offered us glasses of water and suggestions for the easiest way to get to the bars/restaurants we were going to that evening. The lobby however looked like the entryway to a cheap apartment building. It only got worse when we got to our room, it was TINY! I have stayed at hotels all over the country and this was smaller than rooms in New York City! Immediately when you walk in the sink is on your left and then to your right is a pocket door leading into a room with a toilet shoved against the poorest designed shower ever. The shower looks pretty before you get into it, but it is just a glass wall that partitions off half of the shower and when you shower water sprays out into the floor until it is soaking wet. We laid down towels to soak up some of the mess but I would imagine that people slip and fall all the time in this shower. The rest of the room was filled with way too much furniture, we had to lay out our suitcases on our bed and get out what we needed and then zip them back up since there was no where to do it on the floor or on a stand. Admittedly, I am sensitive about my bedding, but this bedding just wasn't fresh at all. The only redeeming quality were the very nice black out shades (not drapes) that covered the chicken wire covered windows. We didn't sleep well at all though because of our location to the jail there were constantly sirens throughout the night raging past our windows. Overall, I would avoid the Sophia (even at the price we got it for!) and stay somewhere else.

After researching and comparing prices we decided on the Sofia based on the many well written reviews, We just returned from our 4 day getaway to San DIego and have to say that the hotel was above average as far as style and customer service but lacked in other areas. My first impression of the hotel was a little disappointing due in part that we had arrived at 4:30 and the room was not ready, we were asked to leave our luggage and return in 30 minutes. No problem especially since we had requested a specific room which they were accomadating. Once in the deluxe queen room we were amazed at how small the deluxe room really was. Decor was nice, modern and very clean. I agree with other reviews the shower set-up is strange, only half a glass-door present so shower water land on floor, no tub in bathroom. Internet not free in room $10 a day. Location is next to greyhound and bus depot so there are homeless and transients just outside the hotel, albeit harmless. At night ambulance sirens can be heard all to frequently which made it difficult to sleep at times ( we were on the top floor and could still hear everything). Aside from those details you can walk around the downtown area, the mall, 5th avenue and even to ballpark easily. Bus and trolly are user friendly if you dont have a car. Dining at the Currant for lunch or dinner is a MUST, food is excellent and service is top notch. FYI- We decided not to drive largely in part because of the overnight parking fee of $26/day.

The reviews on yelp.com freaked me out a little bit but for the price and location I wasn't going to complain. I was pleasantly surprised to find that although the room was small it was laid out well and comfortable for the two of us. Our bed was heavenly! We put a towel on the floor when we took a shower to avoid a huge mess since they only have half doors on the showers. The location was great. We could walk to the Gaslamp and Horton Plaza. There is a nice restaurant onsite and an \"express pizza hut\" downstairs.... I'm shamed to admit that we ate pizza right before midnight more than once. I read a review where someone complained about the weird SQUARE pillows and how it was so hard to sleep with those.

ROOMS Yes the rooms are quite small, but they are very well appointed with everything you could possibly need. Very clean and modern. The matress was amazing! I got a perfect night's sleep each night of our stay. There is plenty of wardrobe/cupboard space to hang your clothes and other items. There is a desk with a lamp large enough to do any work that you may need to do. There is also a very comfy arm chair with matching ottoman. There are two lamps either side of the bed which can be dimmed and swivelled around to your required spot. There are two bedside tables. The bathroom is very clean and modern also. The sink sits outside of the bathroom itself. There is also a mini fridge and microwave. You are also supplied with a coffee maker and mugs and glasses. The only thing was there was no cutlery - we ate a few microwaved dinners to save some money so we had to buy some cheap cutlery so that we could eat it. BUSINESS CENTRE There is a well set up business centre in the lobby which has a sliding door which may be shut if necessary. There is a telephone for business calls as well as three computers and one printer. The computers were very reliable, but sometimes there was a bit of a wait because the hotel is primarily a business traveller's hotel. We did not eat at Currant (the hotel's restaurant) because it was quite pricey and a little intimidating. Again, this would suit the business travellers which seem to dominate the hotel's clientele. The staff were very professional. Housekeeping ladies were lovely. The hotel is charming and very cozy. Just sitting in the lobby was nice and relaxing - there is a fireplace and plenty of comfortable chairs. In terms of finding places to purchase groceries and toiletries near by - there is a Ralph's about two blocks behind (south) of Horton Plaza - it had everything you needed including beautiful premade salads and cold meats which made very nice, cheap and easy meals if you are tight on the budget. I would recommend going straight to ralphs as the small grocery store in Horton Plaza ( i think it is a long's pharmacy) doesnt have everything you need. There was also a discount grocery store on or just after 7th street on Broadway - we purchased lots of microwaveable soup bowls from there - made quick and easy snacks or meals - we also found our cheap cutlery and a few plastic containers to store left overs in - this place is great, but be aware that there are a few undesireables that hang out around it - maybe go there during the day. In terms of fast food near by - there are plenty of food outlets in Horton Plaza with a wide range of types of foods - there is also a pizza hut on the same block of the hotel - about 20 metres from the front of the hotel. Again, you are close to the bay - so go down and have some seafood at the many restaurants along the wharf. Also, seaside village is not far (about a 10 minute walk) - this has a few nice restaurants with varying styles and budgets. All in all, the sofia hotel was an excellent choice in san diego. If i went back to san diego, i would stay here again.

This was the oddest hotel room I've ever been in. You walk into the room and immediately on your left is the sink. It is a cute sink but completely oversized for the room. The bathroom door slides out from the wall and would not stay closed. You basically had to keep an eye on it the entire time you were doing your business. Everyone else has commented on the shower so no need to elaborate there. The bed was comfy but the room so crammed with furniture that it felt claustrophobic. There was a chair on the other side of the bed that was pressing up against the wall and the bed - it was completely unneccessary. It just made the room feel smaller. We had a lovely view of the Greyhound parking lot and the gorgeous chicken wire in the window to keep the junkies and drunks of days past from jumping was a classy touch.

The hotel is in a great location just a few blocks away from horton plaza shopping centre (16 blocks of shopping heaven!) as well as only a few blocks to the centre of the gaslamp quarter-a brilliant place full of bars, restaurants and little boutiquey shops. I was a little dubious about booking the hotel before i went as i had read reviews about tramps/homeless people right outside the door etc but i'm so glad we did book as it was such a good hotel. I'm not going to lie and say that there weren't homeless people around, we did see 3/4 when it got later but they didn't bother or hassle us and i never felt threatened or unsafe walking around the area. Best bits: The receptionist who checked us in was amazing...so helpful with maps and tips on what to do in the city/where to eat/what to see etc. I just feel so ashamed that i can't remember his name. But he was a great help and it set our few days at the hotel on the right foot as he couldn't have done any more for us. The location was spot on, close enough to shops and the gaslamp district without being too in it. the walk was easy (approx 5 mins) to get to both areas as well as a short walk to the mta (approx 3 blocks). we dropped our hire car off near the airport on kettner blvd and got the mta to santa fe depot (which is right on broadway-where the hotel is based) it was so easy to get around and deal with public transport i recommend it. because it was so close to the mta we ended up getting it to the fashion valley district (this great big out of town shopping mall that has loads of shops for all sorts of people) as well as to old town-the original part of san diego, a great tourist spot! i would also recommend \"old town trolley tours\" their location was just outside abercrombie and fitch in horton plaza (5 min walk from the sofia) a great tour to help you get around and see all of san diego as they stop at the zoo, coronado island, the convention centre, seaport village, the wharf, old town and a few others i can't remember! all in all a great hotel and a great place to visit!! i know we plan to stay there when we go back to san diego", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location - loved it!\u201d", "Author": "NottsDinkyDoo", "ReviewID": "UR20818591", "Content": "We arrived at the Sofia after stopping off at the Carlsbad Premium Outlets on the way down from Anaheim, which if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re coming that way, has some great designer clothes shops at (from an English person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s point of view!) very cheap prices!

When I organised this 3 weeks California-Nevada roundtrip we thought it would be a nice idea to rest the 4 last nights in San Diego before driving back to L.A. and fly back to Europe. We chose this city hotel on purpose as we like to be central because of the restaurants, shopping etc \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 but we definitely expected more for this hotel. I read in a few reviews here that the rooms were very small and decided to book 3 suites as I found a very good deal on Expedia. Having said that I can confirm indeed that the normal rooms are extremely small as I saw them when walking through the hotel. Our Suites were very cosy and the design was ok but that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s it, here is a summary of our stay Positive: - location if you like to be central in the city and next to the Gaslamp area. - full non smoking hotel - design of the rooms (pleasant) - rooms well cleaned - not far from a big mall - nice bar & restaurant at the hotel (Currant American Brasserie), with nice waiters Negative: - the area very close to the hotel is not very safe (or at least that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the feeling I had) as a lot of people begging and strange people as well due to the tram station (internal station) next to the hotel - the air-conditioning & ventilation is very very loud even when completely switched off - the rooms are very small and even the suites are small. All our rooms in L.A., San Francisco and Las Vegas was bigger than the suite, so this gives you an idea how small the suites and rooms are - very small TVs and very minor choice of channels - this hotel is so noisy, we just could not believe it. My brother changed 2x rooms within one hour because of this ventilation noise, it is incredible) I know it is an old building made new recently but they kept the old thin windows. You can hear the police and ambulance sirens as if you were sitting in it (They should offer free Quies ear plugs as they do in some hotels is San Francisco). Because of this we were so tired in the morning and were happy to leave the room as you can imagine - if you arrive on a Sunday afternoon, you better be patient, because the only alternative they offer you in case of a problem is \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWe can change your room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - very bad internet connections and no WIFI in the rooms but like in the 80\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with wire only .When I arrived in my room, I could not access it and called the reception and of course as it was a Sunday evening they could just offer to move rooms and try it again or wait for the day after when an IT person is there). I called again and they answered that it was because I had a MAC, so they gave me a printout with explanation how to change setting in my computer in order to access the internet. After a few hours, I gave up \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) the day after I tried again and the line was so low, so slow, it was terrible. I travel a lot around the world but never experience this. Normally as soon as you are in a room (MAC or PC) it should connect straight away but not here and they ask USD 10,- a night for this service, sorry this is not normal !! They offered me to use the free lobby Wifi internet but as I had to use my laptop for confidential material (work), this was not possible. In this case, sorry but internet in the room should be free of charge! - the laptop cable is so short that I had troubles to look at the screen the way I wanted - if you take a suite, there is only a phone in the sitting area and not next to the bed (what is the logic of this??) so that it the telephone rings anytime and you are in bed, you have to run to the phone - cleaning is sometimes done very late in the afternoon (5-6 PM) I have learned one thing about this stay: if travelling to the U.S. from Europe I would recommend to book hotels though www.expedia.com instead of any of their European websites because if you have a problem like we did when trying the change hotel, due to the time difference it was unfeasible as they need to contact the U.S. Expedia first, etc \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. And it is cheaper !!! it is often the same price between the European and U.S. website. This is definitely not a business hotel and also not a pleasant hotel if you like to sleep at night. People that are sensitive to noisy (sirens, ventilation, next door room doors) DO NOT STAY HERE and recommend to take an hotel at Coronado (superb beach) or La Jolla (as second choice), it is 10-15 minutes drive if you want to come for dinner in town. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

Nice look, friendly and helpful staff and free business center Internet computers. But there are so many problems that I just can't recommend it - even to my worst enemy! First, the rooms are VERY small. The average hotel room is 350 to 550 sq. ft. This hotel's queen rooms are only 207 sq. ft. so everything is tight. For example, their towels are longer than either the length or width of the bathroom. The bed is comfortable and the toiletries are very nice, but most everything else doesn't make it. The lighting is limited, you can't go to the bathroom at night without waking your spouse because of the fan noise, there is no shower door (probably because there is no room in the bathroom to open a door) or even a regular bathroom door. After the third time that the air conditioning noise and blast of air directly on the bed woke me, I tried to find a place in the room to escape its effect, but couldn't. I finally went down to the somewhat spacious lobby for the rest of the night to escape this claustrophic room. (Maintenance came twice to try to fix the A/C, but it was still very uncomfortable). They took an older building and did a valient effort to make it into a boutique hotel - but, ultimately, they failed. The very small room size plus some implementation failures make this a place that I just can't recommend even if the price was attractive. (It reminds me of the closeness of being in an MRI machine). We went to the coffee shop just outside the hotel and it was very nice and a good value. We did not walk around the neighborhood, so can't react to the reports of it being a marginal area. There were a large group of us staying here, and discussions with six others indicated that they have the same negative view of their stay.

THE ROOM - The rooms are very clean and well decorated in a very attractive modern, but not overly flashy style (the photos they post are very accurate). We got a corner room with a nice view out of two of the windows, so the room felt a bit bigger than it might have otherwise. THE BUILDING - I think the Sofia might be a historical hotel, and it definitely does have more character than most of the Gaslamp hotels I've seen. Almost like an upscale NYC brownstone. THE BED - It's a good pillowtop bed with two duvets and nice, clean white sheets. It's no W heavenly bed, but it's comfortable. THE STAFF - Very helpful, professional desk staff. Not \"warm,\" but on top of their game. THE BAD: THE WEBSITE - This is partly my fault, but I didn't realize until the day of our trip that the Sofia never sent me an email confirmation. We called and they did have the reservation, but this turned out to be a problem for the next reason. THE SURPRISE PRICE GOUGE - When we checked out, we noticed that our rate was $20 higher per night than quoted on their site. It wasn't taxes or fees... it was just $20 higher. Unfortunately we had no print out to prove it had gone up. If you book a room with them, make sure you print out the confirmation page and take it with you... it's the only time I've ever had this happen at a hotel and I've stayed at a LOT of hotels, both chain and independent. THE SOUND - The Sofia's walls are pretty thin, and in the morning, we were awakened at around 6 am by water in the pipes, doors shutting and people talking. THE WINDOWS - Don't open, which was surprising given the character of the hotel. We had to keep the A/C running all night just to eliminate the stuffiness. THE ROOM SIZE - They're smaller than normal American hotel rooms... more on par with European hotels I've stayed in.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stuart, Florida", "Title": "\u201cA nice stay\u201d", "Author": "ALil'Irish!", "ReviewID": "UR16964294", "Content": "I stayed at The Sofia for 6 days in June 2008. The hotel is on the National Historic Register and was built many years ago. It was completely refurbished a year or two ago and they have done a really nice job with it. The rooms are small, as can be expected with any older hotel, but nicely appointed with very comfortable beds. I have seen a few pics of the \"scenery\" from your window and read a couple of reviews on problems with noise. I didn't really mind the lack of scenery from my window and didn't experience problems with noise at all. There are basically three individual hotel buildings, with one main elevator. B/c of this, your view is likely of the room across from you. Not really a big deal when you think of all San Diego has to offer and that you're hardly in your room at all. From what I understand, and the research I did, this hotel is one of the most reasonably priced in he city. Very close to Horton Plaza (kitty corner from it) and a few blocks from the Gaslamp District. Also walking distance from the Midway ship tour (8 blocks). There is a greyhound station next door but you don't really notice this unless looking for it (it's not like there are buses parked out front). A few questionable characters but I saw these folks all over San Diego. I was staying by myself for all but one night when a friend joined me. We walked back to the hotel together after 10 pm and I felt safe. Great restaurant for breakfast in the lobby area - Currant. Breakfast was wonderful but DON'T buy the $15 \"coupon\" at the front desk when checking into Sofia. The restaurant offers many other lower priced options ($10 on average). The $15 is for a HUGE breakfast. Incidentally, I ate there for dinner once but their menu is limited and you can find something better in the Gaslamp District.

The room is tastefully decorated, the bed is very comfortable (didn't like the small pillows however), good selection of cable channels. The bathroom is very small, the sink is directly to the left as you walk in, and the shower has no screen so water tends to go all over the place, but that's what housekeeping is for. While the room itself was very nice, the hotel suffers from paper thin walls. We had loud drunken people in the next room to us who laughed and talked very loudly until very late (they finally quietened down by 2-3am). We could even hear when our neighbours turned their lights on and off. The other 2 nights we were fortunate to not have noisy people next door, but it really is just pot luck who you get. We are returning to San Diego in May and will be choosing another hotel to stay in due to the noise issue.

The hotel has been nicely refurbished and they seem interested in providing the little touches that might qualify the place as as boutique hotel. At check-in, the showed us a map of the rooms and asked us if a corner room would be ok (they are a little bigger). Rooms: clean, well decorated. Our bed was a queen and comfortable. Flat screen tv, microwave, mini fridge, safe and coffee maker. We were on the second floor and the view was the main disappointment. A roof from a lower building extended just below our window (see pictures) and those windows were covered with a metal mesh (security, I assume). I pulled down the shades and blocked that view, but naturally it made for a darker room. So, ask for a room higher up to avoid this. Higher rooms might also get you away from the street noise, as the hotel is located on a busy intersection. We live in a city, so it didn't wake us up but I can see how it might bother others. Internet access: Wifi in the lobby but ethernet connections ($10) in the room. Staff: Everyone was helpful, especially the concierge who recommended several nearby restaurants. Location: As noted by the other reviewers, the location is great and not-so great. Located in the heart of downtown, it is just a few short bocks to the Gas Lamp district, full of restaurants and shopping. But, it is also next to Greyhound, a bail bond shop and the San Diego County Jail on the next block. So, if you are used to staying in urban areas, you probably won't blink an eye. If not, it might make an impression. All told, walking around with my husband, I did feel safe at night. Parking: We parked our car with the valet, who was really friendly.

There is a refrigerator, microwave and lap top size safe in the room. The decor of the hotel celebrates the history and we enjoyed checking out the many photos of the hotel in it's original form. We loved the location - Horton Plaza and the Gaslight District are in close walking distance. We found it easy to get in and out of the city from this location (close to 163/downtown). There is a small amount of public parking in the area but we used the valet ($25). The room was such a great price that even with valet it was a better deal than most hotels we looked at. We did not have very much interaction with the hotel staff but found them all wonderful and very helpful. The bar staff were very friendly and the restaurant serves a contemporary American Menu until 10 PM.

I received a corner room on the 6th floor with views of both sides of the hotel. The room was small, however nicely decorated with warm colors and a contemporary style. The bed was comfortable and the room was VERY clean. The hotel is not wireless unless you are in the lobby, and there is a $9.95 fee if you would like to connect from the room. The hotel is located a mere 3 short blocks from the Gaslamp District which is host to over 100 various restaurants, bars and nightclubs. My stay was fantastic and I wish I had more time in the city.

Therefore, we asked for the room on the top floor - 7th and were pleasantly suprised that the noise is subtle. The room itself is very small, but everything is smartly planned. The only problem that we experienced was the noise coming from the air conditioner. I asked the receptionist to see if we can check other rooms, but the noise is the same is other rooms as well. So, we did not change anything. The personnel is very pleasant and is willing to assist. The location of the hotel is great: walking distance to the center of the city, sea port (15-20 mins), mall, and bunch of restaurants. For the tourists, I recommend to take the bus tour: Hop on Hop off and to check online for the discounts possible before you buy it through the hotel itself. The bus stops 5 mins away from the hotel and its a great way to see the whole city. Also, recommend to take the ferry boat to go to the Coronada Island. The prices are though pretty high for the area and if you get a car and drive a bit, you can get better deals. for restaurants. Definetly try the sushi place located across the street from the hotel, they have very good sushi and prices. Overall, we were satisfied with the hotel, service and location.

The Sofia is a great value!", "Date": "May 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, CA", "Title": "\u201cOnly so-so\u201d", "Author": "TravelbirdSanDiego", "ReviewID": "UR7477712", "Content": "My husband and I recently stayed at the Sofia. This cute little boutique hotel has only been open for about 3 months, so there are still various bugs to be worked out. First: When we arrived to check in, someone had mistakenly cancelled our reservation. The young, nervous employee working at the front desk was polite and quickly attempted to remedy the error. We had booked a King room, and apparently he was having trouble finding us an available KIng, and asked if we would mind a Queen. I politely said no, that we really preferred a King, and he continued to look in the computer. Then he said \"I will try and upgrade you to a suite.\" Of course I assumed that he meant that the only KIng beds available were in suites, and that he was going to upgrade us as a gesture of goodwill to make up for the hotel's error. I thanked him for his help, went up to my suite, and found...a Queen bed. When we called down, we were told, \"Oh no, all suites have Queen beds.\" Grrrrr. Staff here is friendly but generally immature. One gets the feeling that they had to staff this brand new hotel quickly, and filled all the openings with young, inexperienced kids. Nice, friendly, polite, but ineffective. The other major problem, (which may not be a problem for some), was that the room had vents in the ceiling through which came a constant loud sound of air/machinery/water running...? A constant humming, like louder-than-normal \"white noise.\" After some investigation we learned that all the rooms have this noise, and apparently lots of people don't even notice it. SO if you are the sort of person who likes white noise when falling asleep, this probably won't bother you. For us, it felt like trying to sleep in a comfy (albeit Queen) bed on a 747. On the positive side: Good location, cute, clean rooms, nice toiletry products, nice soft linens, excellent hairdryer, flat screen TVs, no street noise (probably because of super-loud white noise!) Probably would not stay here again. Maybe in a few years, when it \"grows up\" a bit.", "Date": "April 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia", "Title": "\u201cSofia...Not as Good as it Could Be...\u201d", "Author": "vmsPhiladelphia", "ReviewID": "UR7434937", "Content": "Visited The Sofia in April 2007- The Good: 1) Lovely contemporary appearance, spa like environment, 2) convenient location (close to airport and all downtown sites such as Gaslamp, Balboa, Seaport, Old Towne...these are all an easy walk or quick bus/trolley ride). 3)Lobby area is very comfortable with a fireplace, plasma TV and very comfortable seating. 4) Common area with three computers for internet access in addition to the rooms. This also allows wireless access so you can use your own computer. 5)Housekeeping is very efficient, you don't often see their carts crowding the halls and they didn't seem to arrive at inconvenient times. The Bad: 1) VERY NOISEY! Regardless of which side or end of the building you are on, the noise makes it difficult to sleep. If you are on the back side of the building, you overlook a bus terminal. We had one of these rooms for 2 nights. You hear buses idling and squealing brakes all night long. Don't believe the people at the front desk when they tell you the buses aren't allowed to idle... they do. In addition, there are some commercial buildlings adjacent to the bus terminal...a trash truck arrives between 6:30-7:15 am to empty the 4-5 large dumpsters (skips). Not only do you have to listen to the back-up beeping (beep, beep, beep, beep...) you have to listen to the sound of the metal dumpsters being moved around, clamped in, placed back on the ground and rolled back into place. Over and over. It seemed like the process took 2 hours...it was probably more like 30 minutes. Also, there is a police station in the back area so every time a call came in (surprisingly many), you have to listen to blasting police and fire-rescue sirens. Ok, so after the second sleepless night, we asked to be moved to a quieter room. We were moved to the street side (Broadway). This is a major multi-lane street with non-stop traffic. Our third night was also sleepless. On our 4th night we discovered the alarm clock had background noise like rain, water, animals...we used this to block the street noise. Rain is the best for this. 2) No room service of any kind and the only place to get something convenient is Wendy's, a coffee shop that closes rather early or 7-eleven. That's about it. They have a sign showing a new restaurant opening Spring 2007...Current...a Scandinavian style place but it didn't seem to be too far along. 3) The gym in \"hidden\". 4) Many, but not all, of the front desk staff are very arrogant. Upon check-in, 9:30 pm on a Saturday night we inquired about a place to eat. We advised them we would like non-smoking (we forget Cali. is non-smoking). The person checking us in looked up with a sneer and said, \"We totally hate disgusting smokers!\" Now, I am not a smoker and I don't appreciate smoke in any way and avoid going any place that allows smoking but his attitude was very nasty. On our 4th night, we were watching TV at about 10:00 pm and someone attempted to enter our room...over and over...I peeped through the peep hole and saw people with a passkey that was obviously working but being blocked by the deadbolt angrily trying to force their way in. I advised them they had the wrong room and sent them back to the front desk. I called the front desk immediately and informed them of the situation. The young lady told me she would correct the problem Ten minutes later our phone rang and she started giving me the third degree about what I was doing in the room etc. I told her the story about switching rooms after the second night. She told me in a very terse tone, \"I plan to investigate this!\" and hung up. A few minutes later she called again and I once again explained the room switch and reminded her that we were in this room for two days. She cut me off and told me she would call me right back. I waited about 15 minutes and called her. She cut me off again and said, \"I told you, I'm investigating this.\" Thirty minutes later a gentleman called and once again asked me to explain the situation. At this point I was very frustrated and was a little short with him. He hung up. A few minutes he called back and told us he figured out what happened so the problem was resolved...he just hung up. No explanation, no apology...just hung up. 5) As others have said, the rooms are very small. There isn't any room to walk around or spread out. However, if you are single or a couple without children and don't really hang-out in your room, it isn't a problem. 6) The bathrooms are tiny. When you walk into your hotel room, you are immediately next to the bathroom sink...it is not in the actual bathroom. In an area the size of a closet you will find the toilet and very small shower with a 1/2 glass wall...horizontal not vertical. The floor is soaked after every shower regardless of how careful you are. We are small people but the amount of water on the floor looked like ducks were bathing in the room. To sum it up, if the hotel spent some money sound proofing the place ...(new window are a good start; still have the ancient windows with single pane glass), I would definitely stay there again despite the size and lack and lack of some \"luxuries\". The constant noise just makes it unpleasant. You feel exhausted by the end of your stay. Oh, by the way, if you haven't been to San Diego, be prepared for an onslaught of homelessness all around the hotel. You can barely take a step without tripping over someone sleeping on the street outside the hotel or nearby businesses.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cWow - what a Great Hotel\u201d", "Author": "WearyWorkTraveller", "ReviewID": "UR7430329", "Content": "Expensive (I was there during a couple of trade shows) - but well worth it.
