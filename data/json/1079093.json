{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved O-CE-N OUTRIGGER We stayed here for 2 weeks in September  absolutely loved it! The hotel was very modern - lots of glass  marble  our 2 bedroom apartment had 3 tv's! The hotel was very well located - lots of nice restaurants nearby  a short walk up the beach to Ku De Ta, La Lucciola etc.The pool snakes around the hotel  there's also a kid's pool overlooking the main one. We had no problems getting a sun lounge  you could order food  drinks around the pool.The bar/restaurant at the hotel was fabulous - very reasonably priced for a hotel,  we usually ended up having cocktails there at sunset.I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. The serivce was great  it was great having an apartment with a kitchenette,  a separate bedroom for the kids. We'll definitely be coming back!", "Date": "Nov 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560159044", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Popcorn49"}, {"Content": "Loved it! Booked this hotel at the last minute due to a double booking at our chosen hotel. I was a bit worried as it was not a real bali style hotel. The staff is excellent and made it feel like bali even if the hotel is not the traditional style. We stayed in a two bedroom suite for 8 days and loved every minute of it. It will make me reconsider staying at my usual bali hotel in the future. The only downside to the hotel is the airconditioning is a little undersized for the rooms so it would be better not to get a room in the direct afternoon sun. The location is fantastic, close to excellent restaurants and a short taxi ride to our favourites such as La Lucciola  Ku De Ta.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR980855420", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "loulou3199"}, {"Content": "Fantastic time at the OutriggerO-CE-N Legian The hotel is apartment syle, brand new, clean well appointed.Meals at the Restaurant were surpurb, same menu offered for Room Service. Always dilivered quickly fresh ingredients, a good mixture of International and some local dishes. Kids meals were also first-rate. (all loved the pizza's)Sunset Cocktails are a must, lounging around sampling the extenive list was a great way to watch the sun go down and reminisce of the days activities. The pool is great, runs around the Apartments with a fish tank full of baby sharks. The Kids' pool is well designed with lounges positioned so you can safely watch the kids play and relax! Only a foot and a half or so deep, even, our 18month old nephew who really enjoyed it, as he could stand. The pool attendants were wonderful, laying out towels per sun lounger, rolled up as a head rest. The Spa was very modern, the range of treatments extensive.We stayed in a one bedroom Apt, with our 4 year old daughter, the room attendant's, making a speacial point to set up a day bed for our girl! with great attention to detail. Overall the hotel/Apts are excellent, spacious clean, everything in working order. Well done to the Mgt and the staff at the OC-E-N Outrigger, it well run, everyone is attentive, and super friendly..Thank you.", "Date": "Oct 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR448718594", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "burger01"}, {"Content": "First Class Luxury on the Beach Our group of 15 people stayed at the Outrigger for 2 weeks during August. We occupied several 3 bedroom, 2 bedroom, 1 bedroom and studio style suites at the resort. I was lucky enough to be staying in an amazing 3 bedroom suite on the 4th floor - it had expansive ocean and pool views, a huge balcony and a stunning and spacious modern apartment. It is very difficult to assess the rooms without going to this resort as some have ocean views, some pool views and some rooms have no view of anything. All of the floor plans are quite different even if the room you are requesting has the same number of bedrooms (i.e. 2 bedroom apartments all have different floor plans) - thus you really need to have a look at your room before actually accepting it. Some of our group changed rooms 3 times because of their location within the resort and the room layouts, some rooms are much larger despite having the same number of bedrooms - very confusing!!!I found the resort to be very clean and the staff to be friendly and kind throughout the resort. Having a young child the cleanliness factor was quite important to me. The hotel was not booked to capacity and many people only checked in for a couple of days - whether this is due to the price or the newness of the hotel I am unsure. The hotel is close to some fantastic restaurants (Zanzibar/Lanai/Seaside etc) some of which do takeaway which is very handy. I love the location and find it to be quite central to Seminyak/Legian/Kuta areas. The pool is quite deep with no ledges to rest along when swimming - it is nice but abit strange compared to other hotels. There is a kids pool which is shallower. I found the pool area to be quite and relaxing - people didn't seem hang there for many hours in the day - alot of people were sunbaking on their private balconies.One of the people I was traveling with has a child aged 6 and thought the hotel was lovely but too quite - she wanted a kids club etc and would probably return to Kartika Plaza for this reason.One other comment - I would recommend staying somewhere in the middle of the resort - the left side (towards Seminyak) is quite noisy due to nightclubs and bars - again this depends on exactly where the room is located. Also keep away from the rear of the resort there are some noisy dogs at one of the houses over the back block.I would recommend this hotel and will definitely be returning :)", "Date": "Aug 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR799540545", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gypsyjupiter"}, {"Content": "Modern and stylish place! We stayed only for one night but chose the hotel after seeing how beautifully modern-zenlike the place was (sandstone, bonsais etc). Get a room with oceanview as it makes it more special. It just opened so everything is new (appliances, furniture etc). The best thing about it is having a drink on the sunset terrace. Only service could be a bit better but that's something you cannot expect in Bali...they're on island-time.

The brand new hotel is located right in front of the Legian beach. Very modern and impressive. When you enter the lobby there is this shark aquarium where you can see the swimming pool behind it (so you can see the lobby when you're swimming in the pool and vice versa). The rooms are very nice and my favorite equipment in it is the ipod docking - so you can have a pre party in your room with your friends before going out to the nearby clubs (dejavu bar is only 2 buildings away and bacio + double six + syndicate clubs are only a block away). Good food at the restaurant (breakfast comes as set menu and buffet). There is also a rooftop bar that overlooks the beach if you feel like watching sunset from the hotel. There is a circle K to the left and mini mart to the right of the hotel, so very convenient. Also some really tasty restaurants next door (zanzibar and tekor bali).

On the website it is saying it is not open but it is. This apartments are VERY modern and lack any Bali feel but being new it is very clean. It is built on a small amount of land so there is no gardens just lots of conctrete. It has absolutely NO PRIVACY as there are many units built in high rise style and lots of windows. We had to always have the blinds down as u could see straight in our 1 bed suite. This was actually one room but there were others that had the bedroom separate. Our room got morning and afternoon sun and only had one small A/C so the room was always hot. All rooms are self contained with either a full kitchen ofr kitchenette. There are some very poor fittings as it was a rush job to get the hotel finished. Our verandah door did not meet so the A/C just went straight out. We had a huge verandah with a spa so that was nice for outdoor entertaining. If you did not want to lie around the pool and get sun you could do it from your balcony and then just go down to the pool. The Pool area has limited seating and if it was full occupancy you would not get a seat. It is also VERY slippery so not great for young kids. The staff are lovely and are trying very hard but as it is all new there is still a lot of training that will be required. Breakfast was included and it was very nice. There is a great rooftop bar that overlooks the beach and when they have the official opening I'm sure this will be a huge hit. I think this hotel will be very popular with those who dont care about getting a Balinese experience. Some of the suites are huge so good for large groups/families if they will let u put extra beds in. Overall it is a nice, clean modern hotel.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR981250421", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "frannie0707"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d1079093-r21717832-O_CE_N_Bali_by_Outrigger-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "1079093", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
