Did not read reviews before I booked, mistake. Checked in, dropped off our stuff and went sight-seeing. Got back at night and wanted to take a shower. No water from the shower. Called front desk, a plumber came shortly. He checks the shower, dismantles knobs, faucets etc. After 20mins or so, he is walking out of the room (we are very much in the room) without saying a word. I ask him at the door if the shower is fixed and he says yes and he is gone. I go check the shower, water is now coming from the shower, but barely. Not even an idiot would say you can take a bath with water dribbling from that shower. It is past 11pm and we have an early morning snorkling trip booked. We weigh our options of calling the front desk and getting the same guy come again, obviously that shower was not going to work and then trying to get our room changed. After the long day we had driving and early morning plans we decided to go to bed without a shower. In the morning, I went to inform the front desk of the incident. The lady at the front desk (Marina Banciu) did not even blink an eyelid when I said the shower was not working. (Did not seem like an isolated incident to me) Next she asks me why I did not call again if it was not repaired. I told her, we did not want to have a whole drama late into the night. I just want to make sure that they were aware of both the room condition and also the way the maintenance staff responded. She said she cannot do anything since we did not call the night before. It seemed like the whole thing was somehow our problem. She never even apologized for giving us a room in that condition for $250 (Not fun, it was our 20th anniversary). I took her card, vacated the room and sent a feedback to their website, saying it appears front desk does not even feel it necessary to apologize for the incident nor offer to check why the staff behaved that way. Best part I get a call and it is the same lady. She now apologizes 6 times on the call and says she checked with the staff and he says it was repaired. Unbelievable! Not a single towel was touched in the room and I wonder if she now thinks that I am lying too. Wow! Iasked her if they had any checklist before clearing rooms for customers. She said they had, but could not explain why it did not work. There is no escape, no one else you can talk to. If there is no room available in the other hotels on Key west, I recommend you book a room in hotels on other islands. They are not far at all and it is a plesant drive in any case. Location is good and you may get away with a room with a working shower, but the hotel is very old (later I saw the patch work on walls and botched paintwork etc.) If you have a problem and a good chance you might), you are screwed.

The lobby was spacious and attractive, and led into the tropical courtyard with an outdoor swimming pool. Connected to the lobby was a good-sized breakfast area. The desk staff was welcoming, and the check-in process was prompt and efficient. There was also a concierge in the lobby to answer questions about Key West activities and assist with making reservations. Free daily newspapers were available. The guest rooms are accessed from the parking lot, and we easily found a place to park our car that was very close to our room. Although there was no elevator, we had no problem walking up the stairs to the second level where our room was located. Our standard room was spacious, attractive, clean, and smelled fresh. The room had all the standard amenities: cable tv, am/fm clock radio, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, coffee maker, room safe, soaps and shampoo. We appreciated being able to use our laptop computer with the free wireless high-speed internet. When we awoke in the morning, we recognized we were truly in Key West when we heard the crowing of a neighborhood rooster! The free breakfast included a nice variety of hot and cold items. The Old Town Trolley tour has a stop right next door, so we purchased tickets and enjoyed the 90-minute narrated tour of Key West. The trolley tour allowed us to hop on and off at several different stops so we could explore many parts of the town without having to drive and search for parking places. And at the end of the day, we rode the trolley right back to our hotel. Our check-out was quick and easy, and there were no complications with our bill. From the parking lot we pulled onto Roosevelt and turned left onto U.S. 1, heading out of Key West without fighting any traffic.

Pro's = Better than average breakfast with large, hot sausage patties to go with hard boiled eggs. You could make sausage and egg sandwiches. Low rates for Key West, especially if you book well in advance online directly through Choice Hotels and are AAA or Senior. Priceline has the lowest prices if booked well in advance. Good size rooms with two queens available, and there are about 6 mini-fridges that the director of operations, Sharon, for the \"same owner Comfort Inn\" next door and the Quality Inn says can moved to your room, if you request it early and one is available upon arrival. There is a Publix relatively close by for food/snacks. If you have your car or rent a car, the drive to Duval Street and harbor areas is only about 15 min., depending upon traffic. There was almost instant very hot water and plenty of it, and they did clean our room early as we requested every day. The bottom line is that I would stay there again now that I know what to expect, as long as I got a good price ($108 to $135 for early Feb.). Con's = No elavators to the second floor, so a lot of heavy luggage could be a pain carrying up those outside stairs. We had only one soap, so had to get another for the shower. Hotel claims that the poolside rooms are more desireable, and have a greater chance of having a mini-fridge in them, so they charge a bit more for them. I thought they would be more noisy, and some are on the way to the public bathrooms. Doors slamming shut close by are easily heard, but that can happen at most motels. The one desk clerk from Poland told me that there was \"No HBO\" when I complained about the static in the muffled sound that accompanied a decent (\"analog\" it said) Comcast picture. I checked another room and found the Comcast problem was in all the rooms. Sharon (Operations Mgr.) said that clerk should not have told me there was no HBO. That same desk clerk refused to move a second \"foldable luggage stand\" into our room when we requested it. No microwaves in the rooms, but one is in the front breakfast area (across from the front desk) available for anyone to use at any time. The bathrooms are small with no non-slip surfaces or rubber mats for the tub floor when taking a shower. As far as cleanliness is concerned, It is average, and I've seen worse, but the entire facility is old and most things have been \"patched\", like bathtub sealant, rather than completely remodeled inside.

It was a discount special for either AAA or because we're seniors. That's very reasonable for Key West. For a little more, we could've gotten a King room by the pool - but we figured it might be noisy by the pool. When we got to the hotel, the front didn't look quite as updated as the photography would suggest. But, we were okay with economy. Then when we got inside, we found out that the internet service was only in the lobby. Disappointing, but perhaps I didn't read the amenities correctly. Not a deal-breaker. We checked in, went to our room and were appalled. First, the drive to the room from the lobby was through a dark parking lot with uneven terrain or pehaps even pot holes. The room itself was adjacent to a laundry area with a bunch of large bins standing by and a huge laundry truck sitting in the closest parking space. The room was supposed to be nonsmoking but it had a stale air. I immediately checked out the bathroom and was appalled. The plastic tub/shower stall was broken in several places, and when I ran my hand over one of the cracks, I got a sticky dirty substance on my hand. Then I noticed the hairs stuck to the sticky stuff. We went back to the front and asked for another room. The desk clerk told us that there were no rooms left. That's possible but we suspect that there were just no cheap rooms left. Given the circumstances, she should have given us an upgrade if possible. She was unfriendly but ultimately agreed to refund our first-night's payment and cancel the reservation. My husband asked her to wait while we ascertained that there were other rooms nearby. As he put it, \"a dirty room is better than sleeping in the car.\" We saw that there was a Marriott Resort across the street, so we called Marriott. They had vacancies at that Marriott resort - which was oceanfront - as well as at Marriott Courtyard and at the Fairfield Inn, all within a couple of miles. There was no pressure to choose any of them - we were free to check them out and then plunk down our money.

The only problem was that the breakfast area is tiny and there are not enough tables making it a real struggle to comfortably serve yourself and then sit and eat. Another problem was a permanent puddle at the bottom of the stairs between building 1 & 2 which came from a constant water overflow which meant the bottom stairs were always wet and you got dripped on every time you went up and down.

She went like: C.A.R ????? (showing movements of the steering wheel with her hands) Yes, we did have a car and we can speak English, most probably better than she ever will. No need to treat us like idiots. At night we got bitten by several bedbugs and the pillow sheet was covered in blood ( of which we have photographs and video) We went down to the receptionist ( his name was RAD) who was not able to find another room for us as, (as he said) the hotel and entire Keys were booked out. He agreed to book a room in MIAMI. He of course didn't book anything for us but promised that the hotel will pay the bill next morning and we only need to provide our room number in the Comfort Suites in Miami. He refused to give me the manager on the phone even though he was speaking with her in my appearance. So at 00:45am we went to Miami. After 3 hours drive we finally managed to check in and got some sleep. Before that, the receptionist provided Rad with our room number as requested and went to bed. After a great night and breakfast we had In Comfort Suites Kendall in Miami we went to reception in order to check out. Guess what? The bill was not paid, no one even try to reach us in the hotel. So we called the manager (Sharon) - she did know about the bedbug problem and about the fact that the receptionist sent us to Miami middle in the night. Also she knew that he agreed with us to pay the bill. BUT - as she stated, her receptionist was NOT IN POSITION to agree such things with us. Dear Sharon - why should we care, who is, and who is not in position to agree such things or not? He represented your hotel to us. What he is in position to is not our business. And as I asked Sharon what is she going to do about the problem, she said: \"Well. I didn't charge you for the night\" Thank you, that you didn't charge us for the night we spend in our car driving to Miami all covered in bedbugs bites. That is what I call fantastic customer service. :/ However, Sharon refused to pay the bill, and I requested her Manager Mr. Steve Robins to call me back. Of course, Mr Robins just happened to be in a meeting, so Sharon, who actually called me back. Now as it seems, Mr Robins agreed to pay the bill when we send the folio to Sharon per fax. So we did. After 3 days no check received and we are still in Miami. But you know what is the worst thing? During that whole horror experience we didn't hear A SINGLE WORD of apologizing.

It is not easy access to anything on the island, you will definitely have to drive or take a taxi. We tried to rent bicycles through the group set up in the parking lot, but after waiting an hour, we decided to try our luck on Duval Street - glad we did, it was half the price and no deposit (the place at the hotel wanted a $50 deposit per bike). Worst part of the trip by far though was the second morning, when the wooden headboard fell off and smacked me across the face. I called down and asked for maintenance, they were very prompt. But when I complained about this to the hotel manager, all she would say is they could move me to another room if I felt unsafe but they would not compensate me in any other way. No apology, no checking to see if I was hurt and needed help. To me, that is really bad service. Continental breakfast was basic/fine, but the room fills up way too quickly and it is overcrowded.

The centre is about 10 minutes drive by car. There is a good Checkers burger joint a few minutes drive up the road into town, but the free breakfast is good enough, even if the dining area is hopelessly small.

The pool is large, clean and warm, there is a nice Pool Bar next door, the Visitors Center is on the other side of the Hotel and I really enjoyed my stay.

The free breakfast was great with waffles and good coffee. The pool is real old because its 8 feet deep (not many pools are that deep these days). But I think its fine. The worse thing thats going to happen is at the end of July 2008 is that they are due for demolition to this hotel and the other 3 hotels nearby (Days Inn, Holiday Inn, and Radisson), to make a 450 room hotel with a convention center at the entrance of Key West. To me its just ridiculous to do that because all 4 hotels are really well built and are renovated.

The Clerk said only our FIRST night was at the Booked Rate.The Clerk was nice thru-out the whole deal and got the Manager for us. CON 2 The Manager stated same thing, I showed him our Comformation from Choice and he gave us the rates we booked. Under the Choice booking and our spec-rate we were able under the Booking to extend up to 7 days at the same rate, This did not happen the Manager would not Honor our request for one extra night thru our Choice Program. He did however state the room was open if we wanted to pay as a walk in client at a Higher rate. almost 3 times higher than our booking rate. I think from reviews here and other webs This is a common trick this Hotel uses. Choice NEEDS to Review there Status. Our room was in the back of Hotel ground floor. Our room was not the clean room you would expect. There was a Hairball in the Tub Drain stopping it up so when showering it did not drain. Staff did respond and clear the drain.quickly I might add. Our sheets were Stained and smelled, They appeared to had been washed but still smelled. Room service DOES knock early like at 7 am so use the DND sign on the door if you want to sleep in. PROS Short of the Manager, All Staff we dealt with were Friendly Smiled and Housekeeping was pleasant also . I would not book this Hotel again due to there Booking and and up-rate Scams. We would sleep on a park Bench before getting ripped off. Rumors: We heard From Staff that this Hotel will close in April 2008. I would expect Service will decline as time nears. Cabs from Keywest Airport to Comfort Inn 2 people $11.00 + a tip Not too bad at all. Cabs However to oldtown range a lot more.

The Bus-stop just in front of Comfot Inn is the Orange line, You will need to walk 5-6 blocks just past Hwy 1 to the stop in Front of the VA Clinic to catch the blue, green and red lines. keywest City Bus System is in the middle of changing there routes at this time look them up on the web and print out a current route system if you plan to use there services.

Right next door is a shop where you can rent motor scooters and also pick up some refreshments and souvenirs for a much cheaper price than you will find on Duval Street. I urge you to rent a scooter, and see the island that way. Discount coupons are available in the hotel lobby. It is much easier to find parking for scooters, and you don't have to worry about parking meters.
