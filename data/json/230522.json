The staff was amazing - Genaro made us delicious cappuccinos in the morning and made us feel like family. We were there in November so were not able to have breakfast on the rooftop terrace, but the breakfast room is very nice. It was wonderful to be able to walk to St. Peter's Basilica, and we had no trouble finding taxis nearby. We decided to taxi everywhere due to Grandma's mobility issues, so can't comment about other transportation. Despite its being so close to the Vatican, our taxi fares around town were very reasonable. The only thing we did not like was having to cross the busy road outside the front gate to get to the sidewalk, but we had no issues with that either - the cars will actually stop if you are crossing the road.

Very peaceful setting, abundant floral vegetation around the property; right next to train tracks which were heard occasionally but never a nuisance. A/C in the bedrooms (huge perk). Our master bedroom had what appeared to be two twin beds (Europe sizes) pushed together to make a queen. Not the best rest, but we were so worn out each day from all the walking we fell fast asleep! Breakfast is over the top abundant! Service staff make to order your coffee/espresso; the buffet offers something for everyone: fresh fruits, pastries to make you die and go to Heaven; hard boiled eggs; cereals (our favorite was granola-by far the best I've ever had); breads; cheeses...you get the idea! It was easy to overeat. Breakfast is served on the top floor of building which provides a tranquil patio dining spot, excellent views! Be sure to look both ways when crossing the street to get to the sidewalk-you know those Roman drivers are FAST! A quick 5-10 minute walk and you are at St. Peter's Piazza! Finally, the staff are extremely hospitable-you can tell they enjoy sharing the gems of not only their property but also the city! We can't say enough great things! You can do laundry on-site-4 Euros; access is 24 hours. Very safe property-you are given a gate for the entry into the driveway/piazza of the residence and then the keys for the actual building & room!

Initially the cost was 160euro per night ($215.00)....but ended up getting the reservation for 112euro ($145.00). I was ready to book at the 160euro. On arrival we were \"upgraded\" from a one bedroom to a 2 bedroom unit. Since there were only 2 of us the upgrade wasn't very useful. But having a room to store the luggage and throw dirty clothes into was nice. The rest of the apartment consisted of a livingroom/diningroom/kitchen combination. Very spaceous. A tad outdated, a little worn. But in better shape than most hotels I have stayed in when in Rome or Europe for that matter. Our apartment was located on the third floor and had a large balcony with outdoor furniture. The biggest drawback is that the apartment/balcony was a stone's throw from the railroad tracks. We learned to live with the noise, but it certainly wasn't quiet. The apt. is very convenient for visiting the Vatican, just 10 minutes to St. Peter's Square. Entrance to the museum is on the opposite side so still a bit of a walk. The city center is a bit of a walk. Very doable. But could understand if someone thought it was still a bit out of the way. Easy to catch a taxi at St. Peter's as well buses. We were there 5 days and walked into and back from the city twice a day. The apartments are part of a complex where many of the apartments are privately owned. The apt. managers try to give it an least some \"hotel amentities\" with a part-time reception area and a morning breakfast buffet. It seems to work well especially if you are not needy and don't require the assistence of a hotel front desk for directions and recommendations 24/7. The breakfast buffet is very basic, but adequate. The best part is that it is served on the roof-top terrace. There is a view of St. Peters' Dome...but just a top view. The people who staff the reception area are very friendly and very welling to help if you need it. There are several restaurants within easy walking distance as well as places to pick up \"panino\", pizza, and wine if you care to bring it back to the apartment. Air-condition did not work very well. But luckily weather turned cooler and it wasn't necessary. Hot water tank was turned down so although plenty of hot water, it just wasn't very hot.

The service prior to my arrival and during my stay was incredible. Had difficulty booking room on-line, so used email to contact and the quick responses were truly impressive. In particular, Paula and Diana were an absolute pleasure to work with. Best service I experienced during recent trip to Paris, Rome and Venice. The hotel is located right by the Vatican, literally three blocks from St. Peter's square and the Basilica. Paula recommended a guide service for the Vatican tour, \"Little Angels\" that was excellent. Using the guide service, $50 Euro per person gave us so much more information and appreciation than if we'd gone unescorted. Our tour only had six people and the guide. At the end of the tour, in the Basilica, there was only three of us and the guide as some of our members peeled off to see other areas and one was not permitted entry as she had bare shoulders. Nice to know, \"tank tops\" on women are not allowed in the Basilica. There is good bit of traffic right next to the Aurelia Residences and apparently while driving in Rome, it is mandatory that one honk the car horn at any and every conceivable opportunity. There is also a Metro line located behind the Aurelia that makes noise however between 10:30pm and 7:30am the neighborhood is very quiet and sleeping was not a problem. I suspect the noise would be worse, at the downtown hotels. There are a number of bus lines that stop near the Aurelia, quite convenient, every three-five minutes. and it only takes five-six minutes to get downtown. We also took the Open Top Double-Decker Bus tour with hop-on / hop-off option and that was wonderful, very educational and a great photo opportunity. The room or \"unit\" was huge. After reading the reviews about the size of the rooms in Central Room, I decided to stay outside downtown and have some extra space. I am super glad I did. Huge living room, sitting room, dining room with attached kitchen and big bedroom with access to private outdoor patio was very nice. The bed was a little hard, the shower stall was a little small, but having all the space, the convenient location and the service was truly outstanding. There are plenty of inexpensive restaurants within three blocks of the Aurelia. The Aurelia provides an excellent Continental Breakfast and Francesca makes an great cappacino (no charge). Depending on the time of year, the Brkft is served in the main building, ground floor or up on the terrace with view of St. Peter's Basilica dome. This same Cont'l Brkft would cost $20-$30 Euro at most four-five star downtown Rome hotels, making the Aurelia Residences very affordable. I chose to have Paula / Donna arrange to have a car meet us at the airport and take us to the rail station at the end of our stay - and would recommend that. It's only slightly more expensive than a taxi, they pick you up in lovely Mercedes vehicles and the driver from the airport spoke english and provided great information/conversation. In summary - the Aurelia Residences are an excellent option in Rome. The services provided there are extraordinary.

It's fine for the Vatican, just 5 minutes walk from St. Peters/Vatican, but it's a bit out of the way for other tourist attractions in central Rome.

Other problem, the railway which runs behind the house. It does generate noise. I would not recommend the hotel for people who have difficulty walking.

We had a one bedroom apartment, which had ample room for our family of four. The staff (Ferdinand, Diana, and Paula) were extremely helpful and accommodating. They responded to my emails quickly and patiently responded to all our inquiries and requests for help with tours. The breakfasts that we got from Gennaro were the best out of the hotels in Rome, Florence, Venice and Paris. My girls were especially fond of the fresh fruit in the morning (didn't get that anywhere else) and the nutella pies. Gennaro also made the best cioccolato - very creamy but not gooey sweet. As it turned out, we couldn't get hot chocolate in Florence and Venice - they said they don't serve it during the hot summer months. We chose this place because it was a nice compromise between hotel amenities (fresh towels everyday, beds made daily) and the roominess of an apartment. I've read about other posters that have had bad luck with apartments and there were not as many negative ones, I didn't want to take the chance in ending up with an unclean apartment. The balconies were a nice plus - it would have been better if it didn't face the street - but on the other hand, it was a great spot to watch the people walk by. They also had a washing machine available for our use - what a great convenience. I am not sure if the wringer was broken or if the European machines don't wring, but it was interesting drying our clothes. Another great plus was having a refrigerator and freezer. We had frozen water (at least for the first hour) at the start of our walks. The location was not an issue for us - there were times when we wanted to be more at the center of the activity. But, as it turned out, we thoroughly enjoyed St. Peter's Basilica and square and had to be there, for one reason or another, at least 4 mornings for tours and mass. It was a nice treat to walk by the piazza in the morning and late afternoons when they were not crowded at all. Transportation from the apartment was convenient - there was a bus stop 2 blocks away. It was a 10 min. walk to St. Peter's and real close to gelato places (my girls decided Capitan Cone had the best cioccolato flavored gelato). Since we took the busses everywhere, getting to and from the hotel was not an issue for us. It was extremely hot when we were there and we didn't realize that the A/C was only in the main bedroom.

The decor of the appartment is tired and the bathrooms do have their fair share of cracked and faded tiles, plus mouldy grout. The appartments are spacious and comfortable, but dated.

Train noise until about 10:30pm in the track facing apartments or 2. the hairdyer effect from the Vespas in the road facing apartments. We opted to live with the trains as we were told this was the \"quieter\" side and we were on the ground floor, but they may be unbearable in the evening for upper floors! Ear plugs necessary! I doubt there are any truely quiet appartments. The staff were very friendly and willing to bend in many ways to make the stay enjoyable. Ferdinand was especially nice. This made a big difference at the time and made up for the decor. To be fair they were starting to renovate the appartment above us, so there should be one in the Michelangelo block that is brand spanking new! Breakfast was fine, with a limited choice, but fairly decent cappuccino (?). Enough to kick off for the day. We strongly recommend the fish restaurant just down the road, which only has one 'select' dish on the menu, but the night we went it was superb. The \"Grey Owl\" bar is also quite a cool place for a drink in the evening. Unfortunately our flight home was cancelled curteousy of Ryanair. In the midst of a mild panic at the airport, on a hot day we called the VA to see if we could stay another night.

As mentioned by others, the staff was great, kudos to Ferdinand and Paula. The apt was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. We ran into many people who stayed in hotels at comparable prices but for a lot less room. Why stay in a shoebox if you have Aurelia Residence as an alternative? Bus access was great, the neighborhood was nice, and even the walk from Trestevere was easily done. Yes, there was some traffic noise, but nothing that precluded you from sleeping well. The showers were fine. The location and all of the European characteristics made the experience all the more satisfactory. If it has to be perfect like home, stay home.

Far cheaper than an equivalently situated hotel, clean, comfortable, and with the most helpful staff ever. Thanks so much to Gennaro, Diane and Paula especially for telling us how to get places, recommending restaurants and organising a pick-up from the airport. Not only that, but they responded immediately to an email from me enquiring about an apartment, only a week before we were due to leave for Italy, and I was able to organise the whole thing the same day. In reference to one of the other reviews, yes the trains are a bit noisy if you have the windows / doors open, but none of the three of us found it stopped us sleeping or in any way detracted from our stay.

Diana, Paula, and Gennaro always do a great job and really do make you feel welcome. There is a bit of a problem with limited hot water. So if there are more than 2 in your party, you might have to have some people shower at night and the rest in the morning to ensure ready availabilty of hot water.

Their email correspondance in perfect English was commendable and they even secured a private car to pick us up at the airport and deliver us to Aurelia Residence at a 45 Euro cost to us. Once we arrived Diane was extremely helpful in her sightseeing advice and arranged tours and recommended restaurants and everything was wonderful. We stayed in the 1 bedroom apartment that had a large living room, separate area with a reading chaise lounge, eat in kitchen with fridge and microwave (handy for leftovers), and a large bedroom (King or queen sized bed). There was a lot of room for storage if you needed it. The bathroom was beautifully decorated with sunflower tiles and included a pedastal sink with 2 shelves built in above the sink (I dislike pedastal sinks because there is no room for my \"stuff\" so the shelves were very nice.) The bathroom had a spacious stand up shower, toilet, and bidet. In addition we had a small, secluded patio with table and chairs. The included breakfast was croissants, lots of fresh fruit (whole and sliced), yogurt, cereal, etc. All of this was for a reasonable price by hotel standards and a steal for the size and amenities. Things to know before you go: There is no CNN International on the TV, and no clocks in the apartment. Since the \"Front Desk\" closes after 7 PM and doesn't reopen until I think 7 AM if you need a \"wake up call\" bring your own alarm clock.
