The hotel is located center-Strip (great for if you don't rent a car), very close to City Center, Bellagio, Paris/Ballys, Trop, and MGM. It's a short walk through the Miracle Mile shops to get to the Strip, which I actually prefer over having to navigate through a huge, smokey casino like you do at most hotels. These hotels (PH/Elara) cater to a younger crowd--seemed like most people here and in the casino were mid 20's-30's--and the restaurants/shopping were all more reasonably priced than other mid-Strip casinos like Aria and Bellagio.

The location of the hotel is great. It's a very nice property, but there are a few drawbacks. The rooms are sizable, but are showing some wear & tear (cracks, broken window blind, peeling, etc.). My shower head was damaged, sending water in every direction. Check-in & Check-out is average and there's usually a line...sometimes it's long. The casino is one of the loudest in Vegas. I also found it to be smokier than most of the newer casinos. Some or our group complained about their rooms being loud from the casino and/or street noise. I really didn't appreciate some of the extra charges. They tried to charge me the $13.99 wireless fee twice for each day, since they charge it for \"each device\". So, if I use the wireless for my laptop and phone, I'm paying $27.98/day. Please! The $25/day fee for using the gym is very unfortunate, although I'm sure I could have researched that before travelling. It being a guys trip, we really enjoyed the racy approach to the hotel & casino. PH employs dancers as entertainers throughout the casino. The dealers at PH are also dressed to really play up the T&A factor. Cleavage is pushed in the casino as much as the drinks. One of the restaurants, The Strip House, is decorated with photos of naked women. PH definitely has a club scene style. All in all, an enjoyable place to stay. But, it's not one of the elite properties of Las Vegas. Like all Vegas properties, price varied greatly depending on when the rooms were booked. I may stay at PH on another guys trip, but I really doubt I'll be staying there with my wife.

I had booked a deal on the old PH Towers website: pay for a Studio Suite (standard room) and get a free upgrade to a 1 BR Suite. At present, the Hilton website has a similar deal, but the upgrade is only to a Junior Suite. I was a little worried that my reservation would get mixed up due to the PH -> Hilton switchover, but luckily those fears were unfounded. Arrival I arrived in a rental car, and there was free parking adjacent to the lobby. As you enter from the bottom floor, you take an escalator up to the 2nd floor which is where the lobby is. The hotel has a sleek/modern decor (compared to some of the more \"luxury\" decors at Venetian/Wynn). Check-in was easy and we were able to get our rooms at 1pm even though check-in was at 4pm. Rooms - 10/10 We had two separate 1 BR Suites; one on the 19th and one on the 20th. Both had nice views; one faced south towards the pool area and the MGM Grand, and the other faced north towards Paris, PH, and Ballys. The rooms were GREAT. Spacious living room and kitchen area, complete with a big leather couch, full sized fridge, and a table with seating for six with a flat screen TV on the wall over the table. The living room had floor to ceiling windows, another flat screen on the wall, and shades that came down at the push of a button. The real kicker was the HD projector mounted on the wall that used the shades as the screen. In essence you had your very own mini theater right in the room! We watched various sports games on this screen, and it's something I've never seen in any other hotel room. The bedroom was also spacious, with another flat screen TV, ample closet space, and a mini jacuzzi in the room. Finally, the bathroom had two sinks, a separate toilet area, and a shower stall. The bathroom was connected to both the living room and the bedroom, although there were two doors. There was even a washer/dryer in the bathroom under the sink. The rooms were large enough to easily accommodate 4 people, although we only fit 3 and 2 in the rooms. Facilities: 8/10 There was a gym which members of our party used (I did not); they mentioned it was sufficient, but lacked things that you would find at a larger fitness facility (such as an ab machine). The pool area was nice, but not as \"fun\" as other Vegas pools I've visited. They also had a bar out near the pool area which I didn't try. The lobby bar was also pretty nice, and I caught glimpses of a few sports games as I walked to other parts of the hotel. Location: 9/10 The hotel is adjacent to the Miracle Mile shops, which is an assortment of clothing and food stores between the Elara and the Planet Hollywood Casino. We had lunch in the complex a couple of times and it was pretty convenient. The Planet Hollywood casino is about a 6 min walk through the indoor mall. The hotel itself is across the street from the Cosmopolitan, although it's a bit tough to get there directly due to the Strip crossings (you have to go up escalators, then walk across, then down). It's easier to walk north towards Ballys and cross the street there. Other thoughts The listed checkout time is 10am. As a Hilton Honors Gold member, I expected to be able to check out a little later, especially since we checked out midweek when there's less demand. However, it was a bit of a struggle to get the checkout moved; we were asked to call the front desk at 7am, which would have defeated the purpose. Eventually we did get the checkout moved, even though it took a little back and forth. There was a hotel worker by the elevators checking room keys. It was kind of annoying at first but I guess they want to keep the rooms safe. Summary: I would highly recommend this hotel for a younger crowd (Spring Break / Bachelor / Bachelorette / Bday party. It's in a pretty central location and good for a younger crowd.

We went over to the Planet Hollywood casino and had a quick lunch at PF Changs and when we got back there were lines, separate for Hilton Honors club holders, they went pretty quickly and when we got up to the desk they were very helpful and gave us lots of information on what was going on with the change. He has a one bedroom suite and studio suite connected and we booked the entire unit thinking some friends might join us but didn't at the last minute so we had the whole place to ourselves. Wow, when we got to the rooms,they were spectacular! Full kitchen with a sit down table for four when you come into the one bedroom. A great view out of floor to ceiling windows with a leather sectional that you can watch one of the many flat screen televisions that are everywhere or choose to put down the shade that doubles a projection screen (15'x10') in the living room. The bedroom is spacious and has a large jacuzzi tub next to the bed as well as separate stalls for the shower and toilet. Also a floor to ceiling window for great views from anywhere in the room. There is a small washer/dryer built into the vanity in the bathroom for underwear or small items (if you can figure out how to use it) also the standard hair dryer and magnifing mirror mounted to the wall near the sink. The studio had a kitchenette with a small refrigerator and microwave when you walk in, large closet with safe same floor to ceiling windows with view, very spacious bathroom with separate toilet stall and a jacuzzi tub and shower combo. In both rooms there was a blender and toaster in the kitchen as well as stocked cabinets with anything you could need to cook in the rooms. It was decadent but nice to have both units to spread out in. Very deco/Hollywood vibe furnishings and artwork but comfortable and great mattresses but terrible foam pillows.

In the past year I stayed at Harrah's and the Flamingo. So my review is partially in comparison to those two stays. I thought the PH towers were very clean. This was a nice characteristic in comparison to my last two stays. I did however think the rooms were small. We stayed in the studio condo floor plan. I guess I didn't do as much research as I should have but I assumed that a condo would have a bedroom. I booked through a third party and didn't realize that a studio condo was an option. I had just saw the one and two bedroom condo floor plans. Just incase anyone else has any confusion on what a studio condo is, it is a hotel room with a few plates and bowls, a tiny fridge and a dishwasher. The location of the PH towers is ok. It is a little further south than I like but I like to be next to O'shea's and Casino Royal where I can play some table games with lower minimums. The food is was pretty good. It was a little chilly for the pool but one day it was in the 70's and seemed like it could be a good time in a few months.

Our flight landed in the morning and made it to the front desk around 11am, when I spoke with the girl at the reception area she informed me that check in was at 4 and they didn\u2019t have any open rooms at that time. We were able to check our bags at the bellhop and venture around the strip waiting to check in. I arrived back to the front desk around 2PM and approached the same girl at the check in, she was polite and remembered me from earlier that day. As she checked her computer for open rooms I explained to her that we booked a 1 bedroom suite but was hoping to get into a 2 bedroom since there were 3 of us staying. As she looked I handed her my ID and credit card with a $20 in-between. Without saying anything she took the 20 and pocketed it. After a few more minutes she asked if the 2 bedroom penthouse would be okay! Getting off the elevator we had a long way to walk because our room was at the very end of the hall. After opening the double doors to the penthouse we were greeted to an amazing view from the floor to ceiling windows in the living room. Both master and the 2nd bedroom were huge and offered plenty of space for 6-8 people. The master was situated on the corner of the building and offered floor to ceiling windows on 2 walls. The bathroom had an amazing Jacuzzi sitting right on the windows over looking the strip. This room was so nice it made it hard to leave (not bad for under $200 a night). We called for our bags when we walked in the room, they were delivered within 10 minutes. Maid service was also very good, they came every day and even asked every time I saw them in the hallway if they could get anything for us. The hotel itself is situated perfectly just off the strip but connected to the mall. This allows guests to walk to the PH casino or the strip without having to exit the hotel. We didn\u2019t use too many of the hotels amenities but we did sit by the pool on 2 afternoons. The staff was very nice, offered us towels, and checked a few times to see if we needed anything additionally. The only negative thing I can even think of is all the furniture is black and shows a lot of dust even if its is cleaned every day.

From the start our experience here was mainly very good. Check in midday on a Thursday was quick with no queue, although I noticed a lot more people waiting later that day. The room - 3915 I think-was very impressive- modern and glam- we had floor to ceiling windows in the (very large) sitting area and 2 glass walls in the master bedroom. The kitchen was great - we only used it for making tea and coffee and, unlike a lot of reviewers, we had a large coffepot. Only a small window in the 2nd bedroom and a much smaller bathroom but plenty of room for 2 people just not quite the same wow factor. We specifically went for a mountain view rather than a strip one on the grounds we would spend so much time out there! This particular room has helicopters coming towards you from the executive airport at the end of the strip which is quite a dramatic experience and large planes taking off left to right to the international airport. Nothing close enough to be a nuisance or noisy but the view in the morning is great - one day we had 3 helicopters at various distances away from us and 2 planes going across them! Thanks to jetlag we were all up early and as our room was so great the 4 of us ended up having early coffees there -two of us stretched out on a very dramatic zebra print chaise lounge, the other 2 propped up in a huge, very comfy bed and we never tired of the view which also included MGM Grand, Excalibur and the Luxor-lovely at night too with all the lights. Luggage took 4 phonecalls and just over an hour and a half to arrive but I rang for more coat hangars and they arrived virtually straight away as did a maintenance man when we were unable to work out the lights or aircon - instructions in the room would be nice . The wardrobes were surprisingly small - I'm presuming most people have short stays (we had 5 nights) and there wasn't a full length mirror in the place. The hallway cupboard had some broken glass in it - not a good housekeeping start but we had maid service every single day without having to ask which I know has been an issue with some guests. Basically we loved the place, we didn't have enough time to use all the facilities-probably wasn't quite hot enough for the pool and everytime we looked at it it was in the shade- but we would definitely stay there again. The location is brilliant, just a 10 minute walk through the Mall which was interesting every time as we window shopped the whole way! You come out onto the strip very close to the Paris hotel - breakfast on the Mon Ami terrace is great- and just across the road from The Bellagio. We were really disapointed that the Monet exhibition at the Bellagio was in the process of being set up so we couldn't see it. Security at the hotel is very good, lots of people were trying to convince security to let them go to the room elevators with no joy if they didn't have their room card. Taxis are very easy to get on the lower level and I noticed that they also had an airport shuttle arriving on a regular basis.

Unlike others, however, the hotel includes residential timeshare condos and was built in partnership with Westgate Resorts. This marriage has resulted in the only timeshare-slash-hotel in the world directly linked to a luxury hotel and casino. What does this mean for you? If you have your eye on a Vegas vacation, it means choosing ph Towers Westgate guarantees you will have the space of a condo with convenient access to a lively casino and all that Vegas visitors expect from that particular experience \u2013 the restaurants, shops, spa and shows. If you are considering a timeshare in Sin City, it means much closer proximity to the action than was previously available. Because ph Towers is a condotel, every room is a suite. I have stayed in many suites, some that I feel took a lot of liberty with the \u201csuite\u201d definition (i.e. the existence of a two-person couch at the foot of the bed and a mini-fridge in the closet does not make the room a suite) and some that truly have a residential feel to them. This hotel falls into the latter category with suites that could be lived in, even on a permanent basis. In fact, I have never stayed in a Vegas hotel with larger standard rooms. I always pay particularly close attention to room design. To me, a room needs to be beautiful, functional and have homey comforts in order to impress me. Ph Towers\u2019 d\u00e9cor is, fittingly for the Las Vegas locale, ultra modern. Rooms are decorated in tuxedo black, lipstick red and bright white in a particular style of beauty best described as glamorous. One-bedroom and two-bedroom suites have a full-size and fully-equipped kitchen with a table that seats six. Roominess aside, stand-outs for this property are the projection screen theater in the living area and the hot tub next to the bed. Another plus good enough to mention are the mirrors. They are everywhere. The hotel compensates for the areas in which it lacks by giving their owners and guests complete access to the amenities of Planet Hollywood. For example, although the hotel has a beautiful and sunny pool and cabana area, guests looking for a spa treatment need to visit Planet Hollywood. For guests who crave casual shopping, the Miracle Mile shops are ultimately well-positioned practically in the lobby. To give you an idea of shop proximity, while taking a self-guided tour of the main level of the hotel, I found myself suddenly (and happily) in the middle of the mall. Ph Towers Westgate is making its mark on the Vegas luxury hotel market because of its unique features. I recommend it for travelers who want room to spare without giving up casino action. Its glitz and reasonable pricing also make it extra appealing to a younger crowd. My husband and I have a YouTube channel of luxury hotel video reviews. Visit YouTube.com/TravelbyLori.

They wanted us to transfer to a regular room at Planet Hollywood with no compensation or refund of any sort (we did pay for a 1 bedroom suite you know). This happened to a number of people that day and 1 group packed up their things and headed over to the Venetian (which was probably a good choice). After some negotiating, we reluctantly hauled all of our stuff over to Planet Hollywood to wait in another (shorter) line. We checked into a room there for the night with promises that we could transfer to a 1 bedroom at PH Towers the next day. Fast forward to the following day, there was no room available to so had to wait again. Not only that, I realized that I was overcharged for my stay (they neglected the fact that in order to reserve my room I had to pay a deposit of 1 nights stay- they charged me for that again when I checked in). After a long wait and trying to explain to an incompetent employee about the overcharge, we agreed to just go into our suite and to deal with it all the next day with a manager. The suite was great; however, at a very random hour a maintenance man came in saying he needed to look at the circuit breaker for the suite next to us (all 1 bedroom suits have a connecting door the the suite next to them which is not ideal when situations like this happen).

Right when we got to our room, we noticed that the room looked a little odd, and realized that the room wasn't really clean. It just looks like it wasn't cleaned up well by the housecleaning staff. We started setting up the beds, and when we popped out one of the sofa beds, we found a bunch of the porn cards they hand out on the strip all stuck in the sofa bed! We also found a few glasses from the kitchen area that were not clean. Needless to say we were very disappointed with the room, but we were way too tired to make a complaint that night and went to sleep. In the morning, we called front desk and informed them of them problem. However, they kept on giving us the excuse that we should've called yesterday rather than the next day. I've never ran into this sorta problem before. We also asked if it was possible to change rooms, and again, we were giving the same response. In the afternoon, my friend that booked the room decided to go downstairs and make a complaint in person. They did offer to discount a certain amount of the rate for our 2nd night and provided $50 in-room dining credit. When my friend tried to ask for more credits for our troubles, it was then we found out that the front desk staff that answered our call had a left a note in our account that we were using heavy profanity, which is just an absolute lie! My friend that made the phone call was stern and impatient throughout the call, but never used any profanity. The front desk staff at the time also somewhat threatened to call security if we provided even more trouble. Straight up ridiculous.

We were there on a week timeshare exchange and we chose PH Towers because we wanted to be virtually on the Strip but without having to go through a casino to get to our room. Casinos are naturally noisy and full of people and we thought that it would be a hassle to wrestle with crowds to reach our accommodations or to simply rest since we planned sightseeing at the Grand Canyon and Death Valley, besides hitting the Strip. We stayed in a one bedroom suit with another couple on the 33rd floor overlooking Paris Las Vegas and Caesar\u2019s Palace in the distance and other friends staying in the Excalibur. Getting to the Strip is very easy-- just walk thru the Miracle Mile Mall which is also connected to the PH Casino. The types of people who frequent this hotel are timeshare owners during the week and young crowds including bachelor/ettes parties on the weekends. Hotel security is on the money and we did not witness things getting out of control during our stay. Yes we saw people being somewhat intoxicated especially on the weekend, but this is Sin City after all!! Check-in was a breeze and we found the Front Desk to be efficient, organized and helpful. The room was great just as per the description and pictures. Everything was well appointed and thought of. We requested additional pillows and blankets and Housekeeping delivered very quickly. However, they delayed our luggage by 45 min and brought it up only after I called the Bell desk second time. About Cleanliness. We found the room to be clean and well prepared and stocked with all necessities and toiletries. PH Towers were built recently, I think 2009, and so far the premises appear to be well maintained with minimal wear and tear showing. Sometimes it makes me wonder when other travelers comment on the amount of dirt/dust etc. under a bed, behind furniture, on top of cabinets etc. Do they go to hotels to perform a thorough property inspections or visit a particular destination to have good time?!? With our extensive hotel experience, both international and domestic, we are inclined to conclude that US hotels (even high end ones) when compared to hotels in other Western Nations appear generally dirty and in various states of disrepair and neglect. Over many trips we have observed that a significant number of hotel patrons visit a motel/hotel with the purpose to destroy property and leave the rooms in such a state that it will take an army to clean and put back in order. These folks demonstrate an arrogant and self-entitlement attitude with absolutely no regard for the property or respect for other guests. For example there was this individual, dressed in gym attire, in the PH Towers Lobby who was munching on sunflower seeds and spitting the peels on the floor!!! The Staff. We found the staff to be polite and genuinely interested in making our stay pleasant. One day we had to leave early for the Grand Canyon and during our absence housekeeping came for our midweek (we were on a timeshare stay) cleaning and upon our arrival later on we found the dirty dishes from breakfast to be washed! Also, I had to print and fax some work related docs and the Concierge did not hesitate to do this complimentary for me! During the weekend the Valet parking spots (which I think are reserved for Owners only) fill up pretty quickly so we had to self park Sunday. The Valet attendants were professional and quick and asked on several occasions if we needed directions, which we found to be a nice touch. We did not use the Room Service during our stay.

I ran into a few issues the first night due to it being Super Bowl (Stupor Bowl?) weekend, but they were quickly resolved by Scott at the front desk. A few issues I feel are worth mentioning: - If you self park, you'll probably use the PH parking garage, which is the weirdest parking garage I've ever used. I can't describe it because I still don't know how it is laid out, but basically it is easy to get confused when you go beyond the 3rd or 4th level. - I don't particularly care for hotels that give guests the means to be inconsiderate, and the rooms here include a \"audio cube\" below the living room TV that I think has a subwoofer. Let's just say that you'll hear when your neighbors decide to crank it up and party into the early morning hours. - The HVAC system seems to only work in the main room, not in the bedroom. Vegas gets chilly during the winter months and it would be nice if the heat blew into all occupied areas. Would I return? Yes, but not during any major event like the Super Bowl or NYE.

There is a short walk through the shopping mall to the strip but it is not too bad and for the price we paid through Virgin Holidays we were extremely happy!!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cDisgustingly Gross Hotel Room, filthiest property ever!\u201d", "Author": "MorganSM", "ReviewID": "UR123965374", "Content": "I am writing this review in response to a perplexing reply from PH towers corporate office and to make you aware of the unbelievably poor customer service we have received at the PH Towers in Las Vegas and unfortunately feel they are not taking the complaint seriously. My two friends and I travel frequently to Las Vegas and have stayed at The Bellagio on the three previous visits. We have become accustomed to receiving top-notch customer service at the Bellagio, but the PH Towers, Las Vegas hotel appears to be quite the exception. We stayed at the PH Towers, Las Vegas hotel for eight days from the 5th Jan 2012 to the 13th January 2012 and their housekeeping, front desk and cleanliness leave a lot to be desired. On phoning their front desk, they assured me that the room would be cleaned, bins emptied and towels replaced on numerous occasions. Upon checking at the front desk one particular evening at 9.30pm on the 11th January 2012, the same night I had phone at 8.30pm for towels to be changed in the room, which never happened. In fact, they assured me that they had a log on their screen and on our return they would have replaced the towels, unfortunately the cleaning of the room seemed to be out of the question? More than 24 hours had elapsed and the room yet again was not serviced and the towels still required changing! Astounding! The front desk said they would send housekeeping with clean towels, after I made a phone call again to them in the early hours of the morning and took no responsibility for the debacle. I also noticed that housekeeping was waiting for a tip as they delivered the towels, which felt very strange and disingenuous. Having to make numerous phone calls and also approach the front desk as the phone calls did not improve the service is unprofessional and really, quite embarrassing. Their electronic \u201cdo not disturb button\u201d on the door was not pressed on all day and I made the phone calls and also approached the housekeeping staff on the floor on numerous occasions. They never suggested or advised that the button was on? I understand that people sometimes make mistakes, but the fact we made numerous phone calls to their front desk to have the room cleaned and we also pushed the housekeeping button on beside the door, we are sure the front desk was aware as they admitted to logging some calls. I\u2019m not sure how many times housekeeping attempt to clean a room each day but I\u2019m really shocked that no one had the awareness to wonder why the refuse bag from the kitchen and bathroom we left outside the door, did not move from its spot for two entire shifts more than 24hs. Not one person made an effort to provide that basic level of a housekeeping service to our room over a 24 hour period on a few occasions. Housekeeping is a standard hotel service \u2013 the button I assume is provided for each customer in every room. This is not some extravagant perk that is only provided to Vip guests or on request? This is a basic service which I expect from any hotel that we stay at and is essential for any customer to enjoy their stay. I feel this company is not taking this serious and regarding \u201cOur electronic door system tracks do not disturb status on our guestrooms, and we note that both on January 9th and 11th their do not disturb light was activated\u201d we did not have this on 24hrs and did not explain why I made phone calls and also approached their housekeeping staff and I was standing waiting in the room with no light activated. Their response \u201cI personally followed up with our Front Desk Agent, regarding your check out experience. Unfortunately our large arriving guest reservations necessitated us regretting your request for a late departure at which point you expressed your frustration for cleanliness issues in your room. (Had I not made numerous phone calls and approached the front desk?) As a gesture of goodwill I do show that our Front Desk Agent removed an internet charge of 9.95 dollars from your room and you did check out at 12:30pm which is an hour and a half later than posted check out time\u201d Can I ask any customer seriously do they think this is a satisfactory response to complete and other rudeness over the telephone from one of their staff. We phoned as customers and the reply from their front desk was offensive. Their gesture of goodwill is an insult and should not warrant an approval from a customer. I have requested that they please advise us on the following as they seem to have brushed over the fact that Room 704 was unhygienic, the besides lockers covered in dust, the three glasses and cups came out of the dishwasher filthy, when the housekeeping decided to actually turn up. I had an encounter with one of the housekeeping staff on the floor and I would say she was not friendly at all, I returned to the room about 3 o\u2019clock on Friday the 6th January 2012 to go to the gym within the hotel. I received a knock on the door and explained to housekeeping I was leaving in 5 minutes as I was getting my gym gear. I went to the gym for 2 hrs and on returning to 704 and opening the door I looked in disgust dirty towels, unmade beds and could not believe my eyes. Every time we opened the fridge THE SMELL! It smelled like milk had sat in there and gone off and was never cleaned. Filthy rooms, a layer of dust that is horrendous for people with Asthma or any respiratory ailments, my friend attended the doctor on our return and was diagnosed with respiratory infection and she had a rash and bites on her body. She was certified unable to work for a week and a half. The bathroom was unclean and the bath/shower was very dangerous, the height of the bath and no rail to hang onto to assist you in and out. When the towels had not arrived I nearly slipped on the floor trying to put my foot out on the bathroom floor. The railing on the curtain, the bath and walls were grubby and the sink was gritty and encrusted with dirt. The room was not up to our hygienic standards as we all received rashes on our bodies and bites which later my doctor diagnosed as bites from bed bugs. My doctor informed me to wash all the contents of our suitcases in hot water on return to my house, in case we had bed bugs within the suitcase and the contents. I have to send 6 dresses to be dry-cleaned also. I was prescribed a cream for a rash on my face and body and I was diagnosed with stomach virus and swollen glands, which was down to the dirt in room and the filthy cups, glasses and cutlery. I was prescribed antibiotics, tablets to stop nausea, Buscopan for the cramps and Dioralyte sachets contain rehydration salts for dehydration due to the stomach virus. I have lost 7Ibs since returning home due to the illness and all three of us are bed ridden for more than a week. The third person was also diagnosed with a stomach bug and also bites on her body and a rash on her face. I have photographs off the bites on my face and cannot forward them or the doctors charge plus medication charges as they will not supply an email that accepts attachments please? I have also requested that they forward a report from the professional bedbug exterminator company they ordered to check the beds and room for the bedbugs that infected us when we stayed in your hotel please The standard plays an important role in the reputation of the hotels. One feels comfortable only in the environment which is clean and well ordered, so cleanliness is important for health foremost also for well being. Their accommodation is far from the standard we expected and we are appalled and exasperated regarding the dirt within the room, lack of housekeeping and the manner in which their front desk addresses their customers. We took a vacation and the last thought on your mind would be to expect to arrive home in need of medical assistance. They have greatly disappointed us with their reply Because of this, we are not sure that Casers Entertainment, PH Towers, Westgate is capable of providing basic services while staying in their hotels and we have already considered never staying at Casers Entertainment properties altogether in the future. We believe the only fair remedy for this unfortunate situation is to provide a refund of our total price of our stay, which they have declined.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious is an understatement...\u201d", "Author": "Trina-Atlanta", "ReviewID": "UR123944330", "Content": "This is by far the best hotel/condo that I have every stayed in since I started travelling at 5 years old!

Where to begin on arrival the reception area looks very promising we had initially booked and paid for the studio apartments consisting of one bedroom separate bathroom living area and dining area. When we arrived at our room we were shocked to discover our room was the sandbox in the corner. There was three of us staying together the room had 1 bed and a sofa that folded down into a bed. The room was no bigger than your average box room. The bathroom was hazardous itself wherein the bath tub was very high and the shower was in the bath itself plus there was no handrails a major health and safety concern there. The room was absolutely filthy it was covered in dust, the carpets were filthy. The fridge smelt like milk had spoilt and it was just left there it was absolutely disgusting. No matter how many times we requested room service i think they only showed up a total of 3 times and we were staying for 8 nights, it was impossible to try and get clean towels. The air conditioning unit was broke so the room was always freezing. The walls are literaly paper thin you could hear the guests in the next room conversations. We had asked front desk for a bigger room and was told we would have to pay an extra 500dollars on top of what we had already paid, on our last day we discovered we were charged for the larger room (although we did not have this room) apparently no matter what you book it was subject to availability. This was a disgrace. The hotel is in a good location but there is no casino and it's a ten minute hike to the casino which has free wi fi in lots of places the hotel charges its guest 10dollars a day to use internet. We had bites all over our bodies/face from the bed bug investation that was in our room, we all contracted gastric virus as well as one of us having a severe chest infection from the dirt and dust in the room. All three of us missed 2 weeks from work due to our illnesses. I have stayed in Vegas five times, i have stayed in The Bellagio four times and have never ever experienced anything like this, Bellagio staff would bend over backwards for their guests. I have also stayed in the MGM and again no problems. So word of advice do not stay here unless you like being eaten alive by bed bugs and want your lungs to be polluted with dust and dirt.

Key reason was the twin bedroom suite since we were two colleagues staying in the hotel it was nice to be able to have separate bedrooms and baths. First off: The setting. I would place this hotel in the category \u201cparty hotel\u201d It was mainly filled with younger crowd (21-30\u2019ish) and they all looked to have a pretty good time. It did not bother me and we could not hear it while in the room, but if I were to bring my kids, I would have picked another hotel. The d\u00e9cor of the rooms are a bit different. I presume that either you think it\u2019s tacky or you think it\u2019s really cool. I would categorize it as very masculine, rough and a bit extravagant. Personally I think it was cool. In the twin bedroom suite I counted 9 screens (LCD\u2019s and projectors) and it was pretty huge. The first word that usually came out of people who came to the room was \u201cwow!\u201d View overlooked some of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris Eiffel Tower. Stunning at night! Full kitchen, Fridge with ice cube machine and the whole-shabang! All in all a great room! The hotel is not ON the strip, but you can walk thru the Miracle Mile mall (even at night) so it really don\u2019t feel that far away.. A good 5-8 min walk and you are dead centre on the strip. The mall also has whatever you need in terms of shopping. Also plenty of stores that are different than the usual mix you find at the malls. Only downsides I would say is: For some reason the cleaning in the weekend we stayded there was really poor, but on the weekdays it was very good. No casino directly at the hotel (I would say this is a plus) but you have a great casino at PH in the mall only minutes away. All in all some small room for improvement, but I would definitely recommend this hotel!", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Room, View, Service, and Stay!\u201d", "Author": "jrjl2002", "ReviewID": "UR123560026", "Content": "This was our first trip to Vegas. It was just my husband and I on a Getaway for a week stay. We are timeshare owners so I researched all the places we could exchange. When I saw this one-bedroom suite online and knew it was where I wanted to stay. I had high expectations and without a doubt, all of them were met. Just a note, this is the Westgate Planet Hollywood Towers not Resort and Casino they are different places, but they are connected by the Miracle Mile Mall and both are awesome! We checked in and out on a Sunday. Both went super fast and smooth. (Fri-Sat lines looked long but to be expected) They have a separate line for owners, which was nice to see. We were met by Jolie (a spunky little woman) She was great we saw her a few times during the week. I always ask for the best room, immediately I was told I would get it. We were sent upstairs to Room 3917. There is a guard at the elevators that you have to show your room key to go up which is nice. Lightning fast elevators to hallways that were a bit dark but clean. The room looked just the way I expected. The Suite had floor to ceiling window views in both Living room and Bedroom. It was an awesome view of the North End of the strip (Caesar\u2019s,The Bellagio & fountains, Paris) and the mountains all around. The night view was lit up beautifully everywhere. I saw some reviews of the view below (being the top of the mall and parking lot.) I found it great for people watching, if you don\u2019t want to see it don\u2019t look down then. You\u2019re going to get that anywhere you stay. There were 4 flat screen TV\u2019s in the suite and the window shade comes down into a full screen overhead projection TV. It was cool but hard to watch because the couch was too close, if the couch were back 4 more feet it would have been better. Big leather sectional couch which was very soft and comfy for being leather. The windows in both rooms had small vents you could lift up for fresh air, which was refreshing. The heat in the room sometimes worked too well. The Kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, pans, flatware, blender, coffee pot, coffee, dish soap, dishwasher soap with top end appliances and granite counters. Nice big granite counter/eating area. Very big closet for storage of just about anything including a Vacuum, broom, and dustpan. The Bathroom was also stocked including blow dryer (not a wall mount). Everything was clean. Tons of towels for 2 people and enough for 4 if needed. On the first day we discovered out shower drain was clogged, I reported it and it was fixed within an hour. Great shower head and water pressure. The toilet was in a separate stall which was nice but no exhaust fan. MY ONLY MAJOR COMPLAINT: Beware of the 2in1 washer/dryer in the bathroom. Once you start a load you cannot stop it and it takes FOREVER. My clothes never came out dry. I put them in to get the wrinkles out and even on the just dry setting the water always seemed to turn on. It also has to cool down also before the door unlocks. Approx 3-5 hours! The Bedroom was awesome. Dresser, big closet, desk area w/ internet access. (Internet is not free unless you are an owner I asked Jolie a few days later she said to sign on and it would be taken off my bill at check out, which it was) Otherwise, it\u2019s 10/day, 3/20, and 40/week. Bedroom had a King size bed with big comfy pillows and big fluffy comforter. Honestly the best bed ever. I usually cannot sleep in another bed but this one I slept like a baby in. Nice chaise to relax on and view the strip. Lots of lighting options. Nice solid doors. The shade came down and made room very dark for sleeping. The Jacuzzi was nice even though we never used it. We did fill it though, took a while and even though there was enough hot water it still did not get hot enough for us. Minor disappointment. Once again pleased with Westgate accommodations! 9 out of 10! All week we went without any noise from anywhere, when Friday rolled around the place filled up and you could sometimes hear people in the hallway. As far as room noise it was maybe a bump here or there and very faint voices. On the weekend the elevators were crowded with lots of young people but hey it\u2019s Vegas. Nice location right on the 50 yard line of the strip. Great bar usually a 2 for 1 special. Nice lobby w/comfy seating. You can also print boarding passes in lobby computer. Too cold to use the pool in December but it looked very nice and spacious. The Lobby bathrooms were unbelievable. Very Clean. There was always someone cleaning everywhere we went. PH Casino ia a nice Smaller Casino. There is a great restaurant in the mall to the left called Ocean One. Good food, Great Prices, Great Service, we ate there 3-4 times during the week. Great Salmon, Filet Mignon, and breakfast. The PBR was also good place to drink and eat (during the week only though). You can\u2019t tour the PH Towers, but if you do Timeshare presentations for anywhere else (there is a Kiosk at every exit to the strip from the mall). Beware of free slot money they offer. You can spend it but not win anything off it unless it\u2019s the jackpot and you can\u2019t switch machines.

No cleaner was sent for 3 days and getting the room cleaned the day before we were due to leave just didn't make sense to me.

I feel that I was either ignored or downright deceived by the concierge on three separate occasions. Her rudeness and lack of concern, if not demeaning treatment, was uncalled for. It is not as if I would retaliate by not staying at your hotel again, but I feel that the responses I got were mildly insulting and unnecessary when the the person responsible was being paid to be helpful. I was essentially lied to on three separate occasions. First, when asked about any good values for dining on Tues. eve., she recommended the Buffet of Buffets which would cost about $45 and I could get about four meals out of it. When my family and I stood in line at the Spice Market Buffet for over an hour and a half, we were told that the total cost for four of us would be $216. Needless to say that after all that waiting we were exhausted and decided to pay it. If we were not deceived intentionally, we were deceived by neglect in this instance. The same cavalier attitude on the the part of the concierge was felt the next day, Wed., when I asked for two different driving instructions. First, I asked for the cross street on Spring Mountain Rd. for Chinatown where we wanted to eat breakfast. At first the concierge acted as if she didn't understand what I meant by \"cross street,' and after I explained what it meant, she said that I should just keep driving west on Spring Mountain, that Chinatown continued for miles and miles and I would eventually recognize it. This is, of course, not true. It was evident that the concierge was either too lazy or too disrespectful to help me out. The same is true when I asked her how I could get to the North Outlet Mall near Charleston. I'm sorry that I couldn't be more specific than that, but I think anyone would know which mall I meant. The concierge, however, didn't seem to know and rudely handed me a map of Las Vegas with two malls indicated at either end, north and south, and persisted in trying to get me to go to the one on the south end. When I asked her how to take the 215 freeway to the north mall and did not want to take Los Vegas Blvd., saying that I always get confused on Charleston, she told me (for the second time) to just take Las Vegas Blvd. and that I can't miss it. As anyone who has been to Las Vegas knows, the traffic on the Strip is horrendous and it would have been out of the way to double back to the Strip from Chinatown. These instructions were spurious to say the least, if not misleading. I feel that there was absolutely no reason for this kind of treatment and that it was mildly abusive. I don't know what might have led to her attitude; perhaps it was my age or race. At any rate, I feel that I will be more careful about asking for directions from concierges in the future. P.S.: I also remember asking for directions to Red Rock Canyon; she handed my a map and went over it which got me only to the 215 freeway but did not tell me where to get off, what direction to go, and how long it would take. We got there because I had an old Las Vegas map in the car; the visitor center doesn't have an address so I couldn't use my GPS device.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cWould rather stay here then main Planet Hollywood hotel!\u201d", "Author": "postcardsfrompeta", "ReviewID": "UR122799646", "Content": "As a travel agent, i sell this hotel the most, people would prefer their on private suite than a hotel room.

However I had room 645 and I didn't hear a peep at all while I was there and had a great view of the Eiffel tower and if you looked at the right time you could catch a glimpse of the Bellagio fountains! If you looked to the right the view was not as glamorous and you looked at the parking lot - see my pics but this was fine as my bed was positioned to look at the Eiffel tower. The room its self had the facilities listed with a studio but actually had a separate bedroom which meant it was a really big room (not sure if this is normal!).The room has a free safe which is not huge but you would be able to get most laptops in to it. Kitchen facility wise there is a fridge, kettle and microwave what more do you need! I know some have commented on finding the rooms dirty but I found everything to be very clean both in my room and in public areas. I liked that 24hours a day there is a security guard checking that you have a room key before they let you in to the lifts which is just an extra piece of mind which you don't get in most hotels. Location wise I was very happy with it, yes it will take you about 10-15 mins from leaving your room to get on to the strip but this is common in Vegas due to the size of the hotels. There are restaurants in the Miracle Mile so you don't have to go far to find food any time of the day and Fat Tuesday frozen cocktails were super yummy!! The hotel does offer a limited room service menu if you don't want to venture far.

While it had many positives, there were several little annoyances that made me question if I'd want to stay there again. First the positives: - Great location at the back of the Miracle Mile shopping center. There are tons of restaurants and great shopping locations just outside the hotel lobby. Also, the Planet Hollywood casino is a 5 minute, indoor walk away. This casino is very nice with high ceilings so it doesn't smell smoky. Also, PH is right in the middle of the Strip, in easy walking distance to other must-see resorts. - Self parking is shared with Planet Hollywood. The garage is huge and has access directly into the PH Towers lobby at Level 3. - Rooms are very new (the resort has only been open about a year). - Each room (Studio or Suite) has a small kitchenette with refrigerator (small), sink, microwave and dishwasher. Also, a few dishes, glasses and utensils are in the drawers. Although, why would you need a dishwasher? Not like you could make Thanksgiving dinner with that kitchenette. - Floor to ceiling windows. No matter which side of the tower you're on, you'll get a great view above about the 15th floor. Below that on the North side, you'll have a lovely view of the parking garage and/or the back of Planet Hollywood. - The bed is VERY comfortable and pillows are firm (which I happen to like). And the not-so-positives: - This hotel does require a lot of walking. Just to get to the Strip, you have to walk through the Miracle Mile Shops from the very back. If you're not accustomed to a lot of walking, this could be a negative. - Valet parking prioritizes time share guests. This property was built primarily to be a time share, but they clearly need to still book as hotel rooms to fill it up. As soon as the small valet lot is full, and if you're not a time share guest, you have to self-park. In ANY other hotel, as long as you're a paying guest, valet is never \"full.\" Self-park here is fairly convenient, but sometimes you just don't want to deal with it.....if you're a hotel guest, you'll have to deal with it. - Housekeeping during my stay was inattentive. They didn't replace the bath mat. They didn't give me any drinking glasses. They didn't give me new toiletries when they ran out. They're little things, but they add up. - The rooms lack that extra something you'll find in other new hotels on the Strip. Furnishings and decor are kind of sparse and gaudy (a lot of glitter in art on the walls, the toilet is black, the sofa is a not-modern style in red leather). - The bathrooms overall are pretty small. They have combo tub/shower and no separate stand-up shower (standard in most newer Strip hotels). They also have those gross plastic shower curtain liners which just look and feel cheap. The tub is plastic. - The upkeep seems shoddy. In the first room I was given, I woke up to take a shower and the fixture came off in my hand as I tried to turn the water on. They gave me another room (upgrade to a corner suite, which was nice, but I still had to pack up and move when I just wanted to take a shower!). Even in the new room, the shower curtain rod was falling off the wall. I happened to get a pretty good package deal that included this hotel. But their prices can usually be beat at other Strip hotels that are nicer and don't have the time share element. If you're considering PH Towers, I'd suggest looking at others, too.

Everything was looking to be a great hotel until we got settled in. As I have said in my last review at a different Las Vegas hotel I travel quite often and work in hospitality so I am used to certain \"standards\". The one thing I found very odd was there was no Hotel Directory or area guide whatsoever in the room! I thought this had to be a mistake since we obviously booked a hotel room and were in one of the most traveled cities in the world,so I called the front desk and asked if they may have forgot to replace one. Nope. Second I was on a phone call and needed to write a quick number down so I looked EVERYWHERE for a pad of paper and pen...wrong again not in this hotel. Speaking of cell phone reception was HORRIBLE and could not get a signal of any kind unless I was pressed up against a window. It could have been due to my cell company which is large in Chicago,but possibly not in LV? We ordered room service from their very limited menu for breakfast and it was average.Last but not least,our fridge ice machine would not work. It kept sounding like it was working and nothing came out. It wasn't until we opened the freezer that we discovered the ice that built up falling all over ice. On a good note the engineer came really quick and fixed it really quick. I heard a rumor they were purchased by Hilton the week we stayed and I hope this rumor is true,because this great hotel is missing a lot of things that travelers paying their rates are used to.

I believe wireless in general will be addressed within a year but PHTowers is not demonstrating a good guest experience by not providing. We were shown by the front desk where to go for free wireless (coffee shops in Miracle Mile Mall). Main point to make is that ratings on reservation and review sites are not based on independent evaluations (ie AAA Diamond) but on the average of user experience. If you are looking for a five star property - this is not it. People may rate their experience as excellent which translates to five stars but that is based on their experience and value for money. For $99, this was a very good hotel but it is not five star luxury.

He didn't bother looking, so we kept our 2 BR king suite. We ended up with a suite in the middle which faced the parking lot and had a view of a corner of the Venetian. The suites are quite nice. Reasonably recently made, the penthouse last year was amazing. The king 2BR (really a 1 BR suite with adjoining king room) was still fairly decent - projector, TV, single shower in the master bedroom (penthouse has a double-headed shower). Our room this year had a few small wear and tear issues. At some point in time, a group staying here had been quite rowdy. The front door, bathroom doors (in both rooms) had large cracks in the middle around the doorknob (like they had been slammed repeatedly). The TV speakers didn't always work and required some tweaking to keep a connection. Our safe also didn't work - it was out of batteries (two calls to security and the front desk promised a resolution when the locksmith was able to come.

We stayed at the PH Towers for my girlfriend's 30th birthday, and got a 2 bedroom suite to share. I can honestly say it's one of the smartest decisions I've ever made, and definitely the nicest place I've ever stayed in. We had a group of friends that stayed in a 2 bedroom suite here last year, and we booked the same room based mainly on our experience with them. Needless to say it's even better when it's your room! The room itself is well designed - it's effectively two separate rooms joined by a door from the 'second' room into the main lounge / kitchen piece, meaning you have separate entrances for each side if needed. The 'master' room has a spa bath and larger bathroom, while the second room has a small kitchentte and small lounge type area. The bed is quite possibly THE most comfortable bed in the world, to the point where I wanted to buy one of my own. There's a projector in the roof of the main lounge and a screen in front of the main windows (tvs in the bedrooms, lounge and kitchen), big fridge & freezer, plus limited cooking / eating utensils. Unfortunately our room looked straight into a carpark building - we were about 3 floors away from clearing it and having a great view - but friends of ours had a 1 bed suite well up (30th floor or so) and their view was fantastic. Also, the room our other friends had last year had a great view overlooking the pool. The staff are really helpful, polite and friendly, and there was a security officer at the lift lobby so only guests with room keys (or people with guests) could go up. Given the location (inside the shopping mall) I thought this was a really great idea and reassuring to know only legitimate people could go up. The pool is really nice, although we went at the end of September and the sun disappeared behind another building by about 4pm, so it cooled down quite quickly after that. However, during the summer months I'm sure it's less of an issue, especially being warmer anyway. We didn't eat or drink on site, other than at the pool-side bar (you can't take your own drinks or food out there), so not sure what the restaurants are like, but there is a fair amount of choice in the mall to satisfy all types.

While I had an overall enjoyable vacation, there are some things I wish I had known about this hotel and vegas in general before making my dicision. 1. This hotel does not offer casino comps. Because PH Towers is not technically affiliated with Planet Hollywood Casino & Resort (this is the timeshare, NOT the hotel), they do not offer any sort of casino comps. Is this importants? If you plan to gamble, most hotels will offer you a comp at the end of your stay based on the amount of $$ you spent in their casino. Since this hotel does not participate, there were no comps offered at the end of my stay. Since we did spend a pretty penny gambling, next time I will stay somewhere that I can get a discount when I check out based on this. 2. I'm not sure if I paid a resort fee but if I did, this did not include internet access. We had to pay an extra $40 to have internet access in our room for 4 days. Since we really weren't in our room that much, this was a waste of money. Next time, we'll use our iphones to access internet and will do it from the lobby where there is better reception. 3. I booked through bookit.com and they were offering a free upgrade for Sun-Thurs travelers. We were staying from Tuesday - Sunday. I asked if this qualified for the upgrade and I was assured that it was by bookit.com. I even called back, TWICE, and checked to be sure if this applied and both times was told yes. Of course when I checked in, I was told that I did not qualify for the upgrade. I got upset and called bookit, who told me there was nothing they could do about it, that it was a promo offered by the hotel and if they didnt want to honor it, bookit could not make them. I ended up speaking with a manager at the hotel and getting the upgrade for Tues & Wed but had to pay $40/night for the upgrade for the other 3 nights. 4. The upgrade wasn't worth it. While the room was VERY nice with a projection television and jacuzzi tub, we were NEVER in our room (being in vegas and all) so we didn't even get to enjoy the extra money we spent. Save your money - in vegas you will NOT be in your room so just worry about the bed. 5. Speaking of beds, the beds here were very comfortable. The whole set up of the 1 bedroom King Suite was comfortable. There was a nice view from the 32nd floor and we could see the Bellagio Fountains from our room. The tub was nice and (for the most part) worked well. We did have a little issue with the shower head but were able to fix it ourselves. The washer/dryer didn't work very well since it took an entire day to dry a load of clothes but that could have been user error as I've never used a machine that is both a washer AND a dryer. There was a full size fridge, microwave, dishwasher, oven, coffee pot, plates, silverware, glasses and even a blender in the kitchen so this was all fully stocked. There is an iron and ironing board. The projection tv worked incredibly well and my husband enjoyed this. 6. The emplyees were not overly friendly. A little snooty actually but not intolerable. All in all our trip to Planet Hollywood Towers was an enjoyable one. We will return to Vegas again but will stay somewhere that has its own casino.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent, UK", "Title": "\u201cFeel like a rock star!\u201d", "Author": "NM72", "ReviewID": "UR120954482", "Content": "We stayed in a great 1 bedroom suite on the 56th floor with amazing views towards the Stratosphere and part views of the Bellagio fountains.

A great bonus, and talking point, is the electric blind in the lounge which becomes a massive projector screen. We made a movie night of this which and it was great fun. Let downs and reasons for not giving the full 5 stars are that they tried to fob us off with a studio suite when we had booked a 1 bed. Also, having just stayed three nights prior in the MGM signature, the bathroom facilities were not as nice (MGM has larger more luxurious bathroom with bath & shower plus there is also an additional shower/W/C off the lounge), although the jacuzzi in the bedroom at PH does help to make up for it. I also advised the staff at the desk that our bathroom/bedroom door handle had a fault which meant the door would not shut properly and they failed to attend to this during our stay.

The towers themselves were about a half a block (that's a Las Vegas block - which can be quite a ways) behind the Planet Hollywood Casino & Resort - and connected by the Miracle Miles Shops.

This was our 2nd visit to Vegas but our first staying in PH Towers. On our first visit we knew we loved Las Vegas so decided to take up a timeshare in PH Towers so I must admit I was a little concerned at the time our trip came around as there was a number of negative reviews floating about, however, I needn't have worried. Check in was really straight forward, we even got in early at 9am and this wasn't a problem, our room was ready. We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 34 floor and it was amazing. From the views up the strip to the projector tv. We didn't have any issue with noise which I was slightly surprised at as we were on the same corridor as the demonstration rooms used for the timeshare viewings, but this was never a problem Really couldn't fault the place and didn't experience any of the issues others have pointed out i.e. dirty rooms, furniture damaged, etc. THe only thing that was a slight problem (and the reason I've only rated it 4/5) was that we didn't have any maid service while we were there, however, as it is a timeshare we were only supposed to have this once during the 7 days but it didn't really bother us as there were loads of towels and I really don't care if the bin wasn't emptied. The maid staff I encountered were all very pleasant so I'm pretty sure had I asked to get the bin emptied or towels changed it wouldn't have been an issue. Also loved the fact that it is a no smoking hotel as I DESPISE having to stay in rooms that smell of stale smoke. It really is great to get away from the smokey atmosphere of all the casinos and just relax in some clean air!!!

The email stated that they took out the first night deposit of around $170. Not bad I thought. So when our trip got closer, I called October 3rd and asked if our reservation was good to go and if there were any problems. The man I spoke to, \"saul\" said yes its good to go. I see you have booked a stuido.....blah blah blah\" I said, wait no.. i booked the one bed suite! I got a email and everything. He said there was nothing he could do since all the suites were booked up. I threw a fit and asked to speak to the manager. 5mins on hold, Saul came back and our orginal reservation somehow popped back up. Supicous???? So again, I asked for another email just in case. When we got there on Thursday Oct 27, the lady up front tried to charge us an extra $150. I asked what that was for? She said, \"that's the deposit money\" I said ohhh the extra $50 a night correct? Wrong! She said in order for them to book us, they needed that payment of $150 and the extra $50 a night for safety deposit which that part will be refunded. i said hold on! I have an email from planet Hollywood saying you already took $170 out in July. We have a bank statement. She said Noo, its not in their system. I asked to speak with a manager. 25 mins later, the lady comes out saying they looked through their computers again, and still couldn't find that they charged us. Once again, I asked for the mangaer. Waited another 20mins and she said there was nothing we can do except pay that $150 (on top of our $650 room). i showed her the email, ans she said she understood what it says on there but its possible that the hotel refunded the money back since we booked it months in advance. She said I needed to print a bank statement! Omg right! i only had my bank app on my phone which was not acceptable and I just totally forgot to carry my 10 pound printer everywhere I went. So i called my bank to see If there were any refunds from planet Hollywood. As I expected, NOPE! She said sorry, there isn't anything they could do. So i said, screw this. im canceling. She had the nerve to say to me, \"you sure? Its Halloween weekend and we are completly booked\" I turned around and asked her, \" if you're completely booked, why would you guys \"refund\" $170 back then but still keep our reservation if you were completly booked????\" She looked lost. She said, \"I really don't know. I'm sorry\" that was it. They did absolutely nothing. Our first time in Vegas, and planet Hollywood made it miserable. We booked months in advance for no reason, got email confirmations that apparently didn't mean crap to them and they wasted almost 2 hours of my time.

We were also told we didn't get access to Planet Hollywood's pool, their sister property, because this was a Westgate Resort. Ridiculous actually. 4. The location on the strip is great however, the side of our room faced McCarran International so we often heard planes and their flight paths to the hotel were too close for comfort. Maybe Westgate will invite us back to re-assess?", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat in principle , poor overall\u201d", "Author": "LeGrandeLondon", "ReviewID": "UR120433918", "Content": "If your a group crack on .

The jetted tub in the bedroom was a little scummy and required a thorough washing before use (and initially it didn't seem to work but I realized that there is a minimum fill level sensor that must be covered in water before the jets will turn on...one I filled to that level all was well). Lots of dings and scuffs in the hallways between rooms...little stuff like that that make the place seem aged even though its very new. Even in October the pool didn't have enough servers but it wasn't extremely expensive. Menu for the pool was a bit limited.

All vegas rooms are fab comparing to your average hotel room but you do get the WOW factor at the towers for the same price as a decent room in any of the 4 or 5 star hotels on the strip. Our room was 5316. You walk into a 1000+ sq foot space with huge picture windows overlooking the strip. You also get an open planned kitchen / lounge that can accomodate 6 easily with huge red leather sofa's and fully equipped kitchen. (See the small gripe about the kitchen further on). The kitchen and bathroom have Flat screen T.Vs as does the lounge (42inch) and the bedroom (42inch). If that wasn't enough the huge electric blind for the lounge window converts into an 8 foot projector screen for the lounge TV and you watch via the HD projector built into the ceiling anything you want to watch on the TV ( normal TV or hotel film library...:))). Then there is the 10 foot square jaccuzzi bath in your bedroom - I kid you not. A fully fitted bathroom the size of your average lounge completes the suite. Even has a state of the art washer/dryer hidden in one of the cuphaords in the bathroom. Without doubt the best suite for the money on the strip. We paid a thousand dollers for 7 nights. WOW. Checking in and out was a breeze, the valet and taxi areas are quiter than the more popular hotels so you get real personal service. So just a couple of wee gripes: Although you get a supherb fittet kitchen with double american fridge freezer / hob / microwave there is no kettle or toaster. There is also a lack of basics like wine glasses / wine opener etc - they try hard to make you eat out! So my advice would be to take a small kettle (you can use the coffee maker if you want) and/or a cheap toaster if toast is your thing and you want to save 50 dollers a day on breakfast. The suite is so great you feel you want to eat in there sometimes. Also take you fav coffee / sugar / condiments / cereal / corkscrew as there is NO shops anywhere near the strip apart from a 7/11. Would definately book the PH Towers again for the next trip - request a room above floor 50. Amazing. You can live the champange lifestyle for the price of a lemonade room.

The latter two are far superior to the former. The studio is just a basic room. Given you can upgrade to the 1-bedroom suite for a minimal amount more, it's definitely worth it - so you have a huge sectional couch, full kitchen, wall-to-wall HD projector screen for TV/Movies, and then a separate bedroom w/ a full-size jacuzzi tub in the room. The two bedroom suites vary in layout, and I would not recommend the end of the hallway ones as they are not as large as the two-bedroom suites that have connecting doors. It is a party hotel, but be careful. If you smoke or have too much noise, security will come and give you a warning. Now you are out your $250 non-smoking deposit. If security comes again, that will be your final warning. Just an fyi that there are a lot of parties given the size of the rooms and relative inexpensive price for the size, but you need to party within reason. As everyone else has noted, the rooms are a good 5-7 minute walk to the casino as you have to walk through the shops to get anywhere. Fortunately, there is a taxi stand directly below the lobby, so it's very convenient when wanting to head out to other parts of the city. Room service is very limited, and at select hours, but it is decent quality.

We paid $10 more to get a high room and were put on floor 51, we stayed in a suite which we got for $100 a night, bargain. The room was clean and very large, and we had a view over looking the strip and Paris and the fountains. I was very greatful to find a washing machine in the room as we were half way through our west coast tour and needed to wash stuff. The shower and large Jacuzzi were great and the bed was huge. My husband loved the drop down cinema screen and all the TV's in the rooms. The kitchen was stocked with dishes, glasses, and dish washer tablets, and the fridge with a built in ice machine and water was useful. The furniture was knocked about in a couple of places but It didn't make the room look bad or worn out at all. Unfortunately the couple next door had a massive argument which we could hear every word of, it sounded quite bad so I called reception and security was up in a minute. The only thing we 'HATED' about this hotel was Westgate, and the really horrible timeshare meeting we got dragged into, DONT DO IT!!!! We knew that we wern't really interested but done it to get Peep Show tickets for only $20 each. The young guy that we met was friendly and the deal was actually quite good, but when we said we would think about it other reps started coming over, the price got a lot lower and when we said we still wanted to think about it, a Horrible older male came over and ripped up the paper work in our faces and said we couldn't think about it or come back, we were gob smacked. I had to stand up from the table and demand our show tickets we'd already paid for, it took 2 and a half hrs not 90 mins like the rep stated and we didn't get breakfast or lunch. So please don't go to this horrible horrible time share, it really gave us a bad opinion of Westgate. There are lots of shops in this hotel and it was really lovely, we'd definitely stay there again, it was in a great location and had a good atmosphere. Also go and see Peep Show, im a Holly Maddison fan, and it was a fantastic show, the dancers and singing was fantastic, we were sat at the back but its only a small theatre and we still had a good view.

Projection screen tv, jacuzzi tub in the bedroom, and full kitchen/dining area. I liked being able to keep a bit of food around, and my fiance liked the projection tv... and those automatic black-out blinds are amazing. It felt like our own apt. instead of staying at a hotel. We stayed from Saturday to Thursday and i am a very light sleeper and didn't have one noise complaint. We even ordered room service and they were very fast and the food was excellent. Everyone who came to our room loved it too. I think our only issue was the annoying washer/dryer combo... never seemed to do what we wanted it to do! maybe that was us. It did get a little old having to cut through the shops sometimes if you were in a hurry, but at times i actually liked having them there as we didn't have to venture out on to the strip every time we just wanted a small snack or a souvenir. So it depends.. the mall downstairs can be annoying or convenient depending on your day. Although I realized to do anything in Vegas it's going to take longer anyway because everything is huge. so add on a half an hour just to walk to a hotel that is just 'across the strip'. You need to show your keycard to even get to the elevators which is nice, and we returned to our room while the maid was still there and she made us swipe our card which she apologized for but i told her i'd rather them make sure the room actually belonged to us then to just let anyone in. With a quick and easy check-in (& checked out over the phone) and a service for holding your bags after check out... and of course the amazing 1 bedroom suite, I would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone.. couples for sure, girls/guys trip, or even families with children", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kelowna, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCompletely filthy!!!!\u201d", "Author": "maddie40", "ReviewID": "UR119419420", "Content": "This was our second time staying in the tower, first time was shortly after it opened.

The only real complaint I can register is that if you are a gambler, and I am, and, if you are over 55, and I am , you might not like the PH Casino because of the extremely loud music played there. Seriously, it really fried my ears. I complained to the pit boss, and he told me that he lost his hearing a long time ago from the music. There was nothing he could do as the casino hires a DJ to pump the music throughout the casino bars and floor plan. I think they're shooting for a hip vibe to attract the 20 and 30 somethings...

That did not happen. We arrived at 12.30pm a room was ready for us.

Check in at hotel was easy and quick (probably because a Monday at midday). Bear in mind that if you get a room with odds numbers, you will be looking at the car park at level 9 or below (which is not very appealing). Therefore, make sure if your room is level 9 or below it is overlooking the pool. The room suite has everything what you have read or expected from the Hotel website. Probably the most significant features are the Jacuzzi (photo) and the big projector (photo). It does not feel that you are in a hotel room, it feels homely. One of the pros of this hotel is the nice pool (photo). It is very lively, good atmosphere and good music to spend the whole afternoon or early evening.

A horde of 18-year old teenagers invaded the place for seemingly no other purpose than to party for the entire weekend. In no time flat, the \"kids\" occupied the halls and the elevators all carrying a can of beer. The parties went on till about 6:00 AM on both Friday and Saturday night. I presume the little darlings sleep all day to rebuild their strength. This seems to be par for the course at the Westgate. I assume it's the same every weekend and throughout the summer and (shudder) during Spring break. One of the things you'll notice at the elevators is a guard that asks to see your key card. I assume this is some sort of failed attempt to control the partying. On the other hand, it all makes sense. Where else in Las Vegas can you get a luxury suite at very reasonable price where you can cram in 20 or so of your friends and party all night?

We stayed from September 28 - October 5 and overall the hotel was quiet. My Mother heard noise on the last night and found the walls to be very thin. We stayed on the 52nd floor with a view of the airport. Check in was on a Wednesday afternoon and was seamless. Within five minutes of check in we received pots/pans and linen for the pull out bed. There is no toaster or kettle in the room and a lack of dishes, but overall was maanageable. The room was nice and we really got a lot of use out of the fridge, cook top and microwave. There is no oven in the room. This is a hotel for young people and would not be one that I would have chosen had my neice's wedding not been there. Overall, I was happier than I had originally thought. I was very apprehensive about the ratings, but our experience was fine. I do recommend that you bring some Clorox wipes as we found they came in handy. There is a shortage of light bulbs and lights in the room and we didn't have a remote for the kitchen television. The pool was enjoyable, however, It is not a place for children. I heard some shocking conversations and saw some questionable behaviour while at the pool!

The majority of the two bedroom suites are the studio connected to a 1 bedroom configuration, but they do have a few units that are actually true two bedroom units(without a connecting door). The check in clerk told me they reserve these for the timeshare owners and was going to try and upsell me, but I wasn't interested. The living area was larger, but the bathroom in the 2nd bedroom looked considerably smaller than the studio bathroom. Our room was a nice size and a good value for a two bedroom suite. Unfortunately, as many previous reviews have pointed out, the place just isn't maintained. It was built as a timeshare property and has had very slow sales and it seems as if they don't have the maintenance fee income to run the place properly. In our room the shower light was burnt out, the safe was broken, and only one remote control worked. These things aren't a huge deal, but there is no need for these not be taken care of unless you are severely understaffed, which I believe they are. From the other reviews, this isn't just one room that isn't maintained, it is every room that isn't maintained! Our room wasn't filthy, but it definitely wasn't a great cleaning job. What really irked me was all the crap in the hallway from the elevator to the room. There were little bits of tissue and other little bits of trash all throughout and it was never vacuumed the whole time we were there. I did see the cleaning lady every day, but she was only one person and apparently that wasn't one of her duties. We didn't use the pool while we were there because it was cool and rainy, but the pool area did look nice. It is adjacent to the lobby and kinda like a fishbowl for everyone walking through the lobby. It seems as if it was built to attract attention and be focal point for timeshare sales. The location in the mall really didn't bother me. The casino, and the mall and restaurants just seem like an extension of the hotel. I have stayed at many hotels in Vegas and most of them are so big you do a ton of walking even if they are right on the strip, so to me that was kind of a non issue. You can see the MGM, which is on the strip, from one side of the hotel and it extends farther away from the strip than PH Towers does. This is a good place to stay if you are traveling with friends. I wouldn't pick this place if it was just my husband and I, but I might return with a group again - but only if it is in the next year or so. This place is only two years old and is already looking worn. It will be a total dump in a few more years if they don't get a grasp on things soon. Also, noone called us about timeshare sales and it was never mentioned. I can't imagine anyone wanting to buy a timeshare here if they looked too closely, but maybe they actually vacuum the hallway where the sales model is! I book through Priceline a lot, but I booked this time through Southwest Vacations to get the two bedroom.

What we didn't bargain for with this hotel was it is quite a \"party\" hotel. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for couples, or people looking for a fun but relaxing stay. The check in process was fine, we were given the 33rd floor - one bedroom suite. Our first impressions of the room was total amazement, projector screen, lovely views of Paris, the fountains, P hollywood and more. You cannot fault the room design, the jacuzzi in the bedroom was also fantastic! BUT...... scratch beneath the surface and you find quite a dirty, worn out room. Our jacuzzi had a green line running across it, the dishwasher was full from the previous occupant (with added spaghetti) and was also very dusty along the surfaces, in particular the bedroom. I also found 3 old socks in the closet, that wasn't my husbands! We obviously complained about the dishwasher in particular and was asked if we wanted housekeeping to send someone to our room to clean the dishwasher\" NO What I meant was for someone to come and empty the dishwasher of cutlery that wasn't even ours to begin with. We were assured that it would be done, we went out and came back to find that a dishwasher tablet had been placed by the side of the sink, the dishwasher had been put on and had the same cutlery still in it!!! Let's just say it stayed that way for 6 days until we really got complaining. The housekeeping staff are not that great! You have to show your hotel room key every time you go to the lifts to your room which I thought was really good. The Pool area is really quite rubbish and dirty, the only member of staff that impressed us the most was a young lady called Kayla/Macayla - she seriously was the only one that worked her butt off to serve the customer. I found that this hotel is mainly run by a lot of young people, and I think this is part of the hotel's problem. Please do not go to the pool with the intention of getting some peace, you will not get any! They play pumping music from 9am right through till close- they also have a DJ playing music at the weekends, as well as inside across from the reception. Drinks are very expensive - $8 for 2 small cola's $7 for a bottle of miller lite, you are not allowed to bring in anything from outside, not even from PH's own shop. They will search your bag before entering the pool area. So beware! Water is fine. This is very much a party hotel, I get that Vegas is fun, yes. But if you do want some relax time, this is so not the place for it. As soon as you come away from the main PH Towers reception and through to the Miracle mile shops you are harassed by various different vendors, people trying to sell you shows, and guest lists for the clubs. Spice Market buffet is great, and cheap $15 each for breakfast. Once you reach the casino, you are greeted by scantily clad girls EVERYWHERE dancing on the casino tables which is fine if your a load of bachelors, but a bit annoying when your with your partner, it's funny the once, but then it becomes a bore.

The TV in the bedroom did not work, the safe was broken and the ironing board was so mangled it looked like someone has been using it to play Guitar Hero. Also the hot tub did not function correctly and did not turn on. We reported this to the front desk and the lady wrote down the list of problems and said she would get someone onto it. When we returned in the afternoon we had a new ironing board but all the other reported faults were not fixed. Now if there are electrical faults I'm not expecting them to be done the same day but at least a message from front desk offering another room or aknowledging that someone would be along soon for each problem. But we didn't hear a thing suggesting to me that they have similar issues in many rooms. You can see why this is a party location. The rooms have a huge refridgerator, a massive projector screen, hot tub e.t.c. and if you were here to re-create the seens from The Hangover then I guess a few of these things not working would not be a huge issue.

I have been to so many different properties that I like to try a new one each year. My preference is quality and value. That order. This property I would have to rate as a 4 out of 5 but I had some Issues. First off we checked in on a Saturday so I didn't expect everything to go smooth with a great room and all. Had this been midweek I would have expected better. Anyway, if you arrive by car on a weekend you don't have access to valet parking, Owners Only. This was more a problem than I would have thought as trying to find a parking spot proved rather difficult in the self parking garage ( This was strike one). Next I got one of the three checkin staff who probably was the new guy. Our friends had checked in ahead of us an gotten an upgrade to a very high floor 53rd at no charge. We were offered the 5th. then the 4th then I offered to pay more and got the 20th. Then that room was taken so i offered to pay more for a 1 bdrim suite but then that was taken. I will spare all the details but 45 min later and multi attempts at finding a room I got a 39th floor room (a bit of an upgrade) and was content. I forgot to mention they lost my res for a bit (found it only after I showed a conf. letter so I wonder what would have happened if I had lost it). This would have been strike two but the room was fine and it was a weekend. Strike two, its a Long walk to the Strip and easy to get turned around. There was no strike three so this was my last real complaint. The room was nice, a bit worn but a Bedroom with a small Lv rm attached. Bathroom was nothing special. The maid kept it clean so no complaints. It had a tiny kitchen. There are multi room layouts for this property so you could end up with about anything. Views were nice but you are off the strip a bit so they aren't really as great as you would think. Pool. I didnt go as it was poor weather but the pool is right out front of the lobby and not really that nice compared to other properties. Still overall this is not a bad place. My issues were the lack of parking, Poor front desk help. Mediocre Pool. The Good: If you can keep the rate around what a hotel room costs in a 4 star, this is a great value. I didn't like the long walk through the Miracle Mile shops to get to the strip but some might like this. You will have a chance at a amazing room for a reasonable rate if you show midweek.

This was our second time staying here and both times we loved it! Everything was great. We stayed in a studio suite which is their regular room. It was really nice and the rooms are the nicest I've stayed at in Vegas. Large ceiling to floor window with an automatic shade that you can close with TV remote. We had a decent view on 30th floor of part of the strip and the mountains. Nice 42 inch TV and comfortable bed. NO bedbugs which I check for every time I stay at a hotel. It had a small kitchenette with toaster, microwave, fridge, coffeepot, coffee, dishes, corkscrew, can opener, etc. One thing that's hard to come by in a Vegas hotel room is a coffeepot & fridge and we loved having these amenities free with the price of the room. The bathroom had the toilet in a separate room with a sliding door which was great. It had a leather couch that folded out into a bed and coffee table as well. Everything was black, red and tan brown which looked really nice. Even a black toilet!! Our room was cleaned every day and it was nice and quiet. NO resort fee like most hotels in Vegas charge when you get there (Except Harrah's properties, they don't). The whole hotel is smoke free which is great because I have allergies. The location is great! It is attached to the miracle mile shopping mall which has tons of shopping with decent prices and tons of restaurants to eat at. To get to the strip you walk through the mall which takes about 4-5 minutes tops. The mall is attached to Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino as well so even though PH Towers doesn't have a casino right in it, it's a 4 minute walk to this one. There are 2 ABC stores in this mall as well which have 1 litre bottled water for .99 cents and cheap liquor. Really handy to stock up and take to the room. At other places in Vegas it can be very expensive. Some restaurants we really liked that were right in the mall and PH resort were Panda Express, Earl of Sandwich, Ocean One, Spice Market Buffet and Cheeseburger Brand. The pool was great!! Water wasn't too cold, it had tables with chairs and lots of loungers to lay on. In the pool there was 2 platform areas that were 6 inches deep where you could sit or lay around right in the water. This was great as it was super hot out! They played great music, not too loud during the week but on the weekend there was a DJ and they turned it up louder which was fun. It's Vegas! I can't think of anything we didn't like about this place. The only thing I noticed was the room was a little dusty in places that weren't cleaned often, sometimes you had to flush the toilet twice for it to go down properly and on weekends it was alot busier with people partying but it gets like that everywhere on the weekend in Vegas. These things were minor. They do have great security though and you have to show your room key every time you go to elevator or pool. This is good because it's safe and it keeps everyone else from crowding the pool that's not staying there. You are allowed to bring guests to your pool though which we did. Staff was friendly too. I would definitely stay here again for a 3rd time!

Upon speaking to the staff, we were informed that for Timeshare units, we would need to request services for housekeeping and that they typically clean the room on the 4th day of occupancy. Who Knew? After we requested services, the room was still never cleaned. The houskeeper stated that she had no record of the room requiring cleaning services. My wife then stated that the room needed to be cleaned whether she had a record or not since we had already been in the room for 4 days. No paper products etc...We also contacted 2 different staff members (concierge) who stated that this was not acceptable and even outrageous that this would occur and that they would ensure the room was cleaned. Never happened. Instead both of the staff members were more interested in selling us \"discounted\" tickets to some shows. Our concierge even tried to set up a \"mandatory\" meeting with us so he could put us in front of a Salesperson who tried to sell us an upgrade to our unit..Unbelievable!..Upon checkout, my wife explained our concerns to the front desk who stated \" Oh well, what are you gonna do?\".

Quick check in, easy to get around inside since there is no casino, non smoking rooms, easy shopping in attached mall, easy access to other hotels, fully stocked kitchenettes, awesome wall of floor to ceiling windows in living room with motorized roll up/down shades! Starbucks is a little walk thru the mall to PH hotel, but worth it after a long night out (wish they had one closer) Very clean, nice decor! The pool is exposed thru a wall of windows to the lobby and bar and pretty small. We rented an area with a lounge bed and 2 chairs for the day at the pool and we found it to be a decent price for the space and service we received. Good security at the elevators so random persons can't go up unless they are with you and the key. The bed was really comfortable and the room and bathroom were very spacious. The 1 bedroom also had a pull out bed in the living room couch which could come in handy. Food - we hit up the buffet at the new M hotel which is south of the airport about 10 to 15 minutes. It was good, includes unlimited beer and wine in the $16 lunch bufett price which was totally worth it! BBQ nachos at PBR Rock Bar and Grill in the PH mall were yummy but pass on the spinach dip. Pizza at the NYNY hotel is the best, downstairs in the middle by the dueling piano bar, eat while listening to music you can't help but know the words to!

I asked if they could deliver the package to our room since we were getting ready to go to lunch and had not planned on a 45 minute wait. They said no. I asked why they would have called us down to pick up the package under these circumstances and the response I received was, \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\" The housekeeping staff and engineering staff were pleasant and friendly but you can tell that the management does not care about you unless you are a timeshare owner. Even the Westgate sales rep told us this. He said the resort is managed by another company and not Westgate, but in my opinion Westgate needs to step in and put some standards in place.

It didn't take long to get there from the airport (on a Thursday afternoon) and the short walk through the miracle mile onto the strip meant it was very central. When checking in we decided to try offering a $20 tip for a high room with a good view of the strip. The receptionist told us this is what she had given us, so we gave her the tip. Upon entering the room we were very disappointed to find we had been given a room at the back of the hotel with a view of the car park, not the strip, although it was a high room. We immediately went back to see the same receptionist since we'd given her the tip and she found us another room but said it was way down the corridor. This next room was perfect for us, it was on the 54th floor with an excellent view of the strip from the dining/sitting room, and from the bedroom we looked onto the Paris hotel & Eiffel tower. The rooms were very spacious and comfortable. We found the rooms to be clean and only on one day housekeeping missed us out so we had no clean towels. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a fairly large TV in the bedroom and in the living room. We couldn't find any info on the hotel's services or amenities in the room and that would have been helpful. The kitchen seemed ok although we did not use it except for the fridge. We could hear our neighbour's music on an evening but this didn't bother us, it wasn't too bad once the doors were closed in our bedroom and we were always too tired for it to keep us awake! Because of the central location of this hotel we were always close to many restaurants, shops & casinos. For breakfast we walked about 10 mins to the nearest Denny's. Most of the staff around the hotel were very friendly but we found that concierge was often very busy or there was no one at the desk. We tried to avoid the timeshare desk. We visited the pool pretty early in the day so always got a choice of were to sit, there was a nice atmosphere round the pool, with music and waitresses walking round to serve drinks.

When we got into the room and unpacked everything, we discover that we just had 1 glass in the room. As we were 2, we asked if we could have another glass and also coffee cups. A guy came into the room to check if there was only one glass. When he was in the room we also asked him about the noisy weaseling draft of air coming under the door. He said that it was not normal and He was going to call an engineer. After a while the engineer came to fixed it so we left the room for him to do it. We came back 4 hours later at 11:30 p.m. to find out that it wasn\u2019t fixed and we still have only one glass in the room. We called reception again to ask if they could send us a glass as we had a very special bottle of wine to celebrate our arrival in las vegas and we couldn\u2019t. They send us 2 plates and 2 breakfast bowls. As this was getting ridiculous we went downstairs to see if there was something they could do about the noisy weaseling draft of air as there was no way anyone could sleet with that noise. the answer we got was to put a towel under the door and that could help as there was not much they could do. they were sorry about the glass as they run out of wine glasses. We were not really happy that after over 4 hours for then to fixed they said put a towel on the floor and it may be better. We asked to get another room that we could sleep as we were really tired since we came driving all day from San Francisco. The answer we got is that they were quite busy in the hotel and no other room was available. I demand to do something about it as that was unacceptable. She went to talk to her manager and after over 10 min waiting she came back to give us another room that was not as nice as our original since the view was on the other side. We didn\u2019t take it and asked to have one on the same side that the one we had as it wasn\u2019t fair for us. She said, sorry no other room available as we are really busy tomorrow monday. I don\u2019t really see that as my problem so I asked if could I talk to the manager myself, she left again for another more than 10 min. this was already 12.30 AM and we were extremely tired, and she said that there was nothing else they could do. Again I said that I would like to talk to the manager and she said that he just left, I wasn\u2019t happy with that and said that I wasn\u2019t going anywhere until he came to talk to me. 2 min later he was there. He said that it was really weird that we had that problem as it was something really unusual, (the girl said really quick to put a towel so I guess they have it all the time) and that he could give us an upgrade to a very nice suite. We went to see the suite and there was no upgrade, the windows were less than half of the size of our first room, and the bedroom was half of the size of our original room, there was an annex sitting room but not very useful for us. Also to move to that room we had to pack everything again go down the lobby and up again as it was in the other side of the hotel. We decided to sleep in our original room, with ear plugs. At around 1.30 AM we finally went to bed and of course we couldn\u2019t even have a glass of wine as they were out of glasses.

The first room we were offered was on floor 9, the receptionist seemed to hint that there were possibly other rooms, but they were so busy at the weekend. Then my husband mentiond that we were in Vegas for our 10th anniversary, and that we were married actually in Vegas, and suddenly there is a room on floor 34. It was an owners room, and had been converted for a disabled owner. This meant it had wider doors and a few handrails in teh bathroom - great for hanging all the towels on ! The room was as amazing as all teh photos portray - no issues with stains or leftovers from previous stays - maybe because it was an owners room ? No problems with us for housekeeping, room was cleaned every day, bins emptied, toiletries restocked, dishwasher loaded up, bedding changed etc There were a few bulbs out, but when a ftting has 4 bulbs, one being out is not going to make me write a bad review...... Bearing in mind I travelled with an 8 year old, I was a bit concerned about the party atmosphere. Firstly, this is very evident at teh weekend. Lots of drinking beer in the pool. But they didn't bother us, and anyway, during a 42 degree LV heatwave, 8am round the pool was plenty hot enough, before the partying began and the loud music started (about 10am). In our room, we heard a very small, distant amount of partying at about 1am one day and 10pm the next (well, the same one actually) but it only went on an hour max. We never actually saw anyone else on our floor the entire week we were there. All in all, there were far more good things about this hotel than bad, we had a great time there as a family and there were plenty of other people with kids. It was great being handy for the mall, ABC is ok for last minute stuff, but Walgreens out on the strip is cheaper. We travelled with Virgin, and really cant complain at all. Although next time, I think we would choose somewhere with a pool complex. GReat shopping - I would recommend buying a 3 day ticket on the Deuce bus and going out to the outlets.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wash DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "Bre007", "ReviewID": "UR118204247", "Content": "PH Towers Westgate (1 bed room 55 floor) I was there Mon-Thur (the weekend maybe a little different) ***Pros 1-The hotel is in the middle of the strip. You are close to everything or a cab ride away. 2- Connected to the mall which has two (ABC stores) Liq stores and other goodies and tolities. So if you forget something there is the mall. 3- Very nice hotel pool was not crowd while I was there 4- The rooms are spacious and have a full size kitchen and washer and dryer and a projection screen. This is a hotel/timeshare. I did not do the timeshare talk. 5- Room service was prompt and the food was good. ***Cons 1-As some may have said the housekeeping is a bit lax. Not sure if it is because it is a hotel/time share and they tend to not clean the rooms every day. The one day I did see housekeeping they were nice and friendly. So your level of housekeeping may vary. You may require a little less or a little more. If I were traveling with a group I would have required more attention (toilet paper, towels etc.,) 2-Yes the walls can be thin and I could hear the guy in the next room snoring. The snoring maybe a problem if you are a light sleeper. It was not an issue for me because after hanging out I was tried and quickly feel asleep. ***Meeting in the middle 1-Overall it is a great hotel with a good location. The staff was helpful and nice. I would stay again. I like the idea of it not feel so hotelsie (ok not a word but you understand). The full kitchen a was a big plus and save us on spending. ***Other stuff 1- Incase you do the tram/ monorail you can get a three day pass for $28 worth it. But here is the deal it is not easy to get to as you have to physically go inside Bally\u2019s to get to it. The Paris stop is closed. 2-Las Vegas on a budget breakfast: place in the mall has 3.95 breakfast and other places that have dinner/lunch under 5.99 or less 3-The PH @Westgate is a short walk to the regular PH 4-Try to get a high floor facing the strip it is worth the upgrade 5- Find yourself an online deal 6- It\u2019s about 3 miles from the airport Hope this helps", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Devonport, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWe had a great time\u201d", "Author": "Kim004", "ReviewID": "UR118174268", "Content": "Stayed here for several days and had a great time.

The decor was ultra-modern, with a zebra striped lounge in the bedroom, black, white, and chrome or red bedding, granite floors and counters, a big L-shaped couch, and a full kitchen with full sized refrigerator. The bathroom was all glass and granite, with double sinks, and the room had electronically raised/lowered shutters that blocked out the light. The view was not so good, mostly of a parking lot and the back side of other hotels along the strip, but the Planet Hollywood complex was huge and full of shops, casinos, restaurants, bars, even a couple of ABC stores from the chain in Hawaii.

We had originally booked a Studio Suite but when we checked in, they offered a One Bedroom Suite Upgrade on a higher floor at a good rate so we decided to take it. I was especially excited for the jacuzzi! WELL...we go up to the room and the view is absolutely stunning. We walked around a bit and right next to the bed noticed a stain that was very obvious what it was. Gross. We put a towel over it for our entire stay. I decided to take a bath right away in the jacuzzi. The faucet didn't work...only the sprayer so it took forever to fill. The light in the shower did not work and the lights in the bathroom are placed oddly so you sort of do need light in the shower. That night we went out a bit and then came back with bottles of water for the fridge...we opened the fridge and OH MY GOD THE STINK! It smelled like milk had sat in there and spoiled and was never cleaned. The room stunk for a good while afterwards. Initially we would try to open the door quickly to grab the water but eventually just gave up on that. It was unbearable. Finally, we attempted on numerous occasions to order room service and were never able to. The one time we did get through, the woman gave us a wait time of close to 2 hours...really?!? Every other time it sounded suspiciously like someone was picking up and then hanging up. Anyway, my boyfriend and I don't really enjoy complaining so we let this stuff slide and then went downstairs to the front desk a day before we were going to check out to let them know about everything. The man at the desk could not have been more rude. He basically told us that because we didn't tell him earlier, that he couldn't do anything. NEVER apologized. He initially picked up a pen and halfheartedly wrote down our first complaint (the stain) and then didn't write anything else down after that (so for whoever gets this room after us....sorry! We tried to have it fixed for you.) In all: gorgeous view and would have been a very nice stay if everything had worked. Front Desk was AWFUL. Room Service was non-existent.

NO Blender or Toaster in ours. It is a nonsmoking hotel- so if you smoke pick a different hotel. The gym is free to use for guests which is great since most hotels on the strip charge guests a hefty price to workout. It is not the best nor the worst hotel gym. About 6 cardio machines, some free weights and about 10 weight machines. The hotel lobby bar closes early but has a great happy hour special. The pool is really nice and relaxing and the pool bar serves lunch daily! People complain about the walk to the strip, but to be honest it is no farther than walking from the back of caesar's of MGM. You just walk through the mall instead of a casino. The wireless internet that we had to pay a steep extra charge for never worked efficiently.

As most reviewers have noted, this is like a perpetual spring break at this place. Drunks kids are EVERYWHERE, which I don't really care about, but they could be hazzardous on those 10 inch stilletos they totter around in. It's noisy before the clubs open with everyone getting ready to go out. Again, not a bother since we don't mind loud music. The room was really nice and big. We didn't have any issues with cleanliness. Beds were super comfy. We didn't use the jacuzzi that was in one of the bedrooms (our daughter threatened us with death if she heard it come on). I didn't particularily like the glass doors for the toilet room and shower as there was no stop-gap to keep you from slamming them shut. I was terrified I would smash them to pieces every time I closed them! The only gripe about the room was that they promote there are tv's everywhere in the room, but for us, there were only 2 tv's out of 4 that worked due to the fact that the remote controls laid out for them did not match the brand of the tv and wouldn't work. We tried to see if maybe they were just mixed up, but no. Then my hubby figured out the projecton tv........................but there was no sound and it did not ever work. It stinks to have it advertised, pay nearly $500 a night for a room with malfunctioning equpiment. Now, about that customer service. We arrived at 5:45 p.m. on Friday night. We were told our room wasn't ready yet, but that the check in clerk would see if they could give us something equivalent. Now, I know this is Vegas and you always run the risk of losing the better room to someone that arrives earlier, but to be told that they would \"try\" to get a similar room was ridiculous - especially since we'd already paid for one night! For that price the room should have been ready and waiting without any questions. When that whole thing got straightened out, the credit card machine wouldn't work, so they did something else to run the card and sent us on our way. Finally checked in, we took our first trip on the elevators which are just shy of Disneyland's Tower of Terror ride (LOL). Your ears pop and it will make you nauseous. You literally feel like you are going to float off the ground - these things are FAST. Got to the room, everyone was very excited to get our night going so we decided to eat in through room service dining. They selection on the menu isn't vast, but suitable enough for what we were wanting. My daughter called to order and.................................they told us that we weren't shown as being checked in so we'd have to pay by credit card when the server showed up. We figured it was a busy hotel, and they probably just hadn't gotten their credit card machine up and going. When the food was delivered the server spent an additional 10 minutes in the room using the phone to call \"downstairs\" to run hubby's cc. The next morning, once we'd all woken up we again decided to use room service as nobody felt like getting dressed and going out to eat. I called down to order this time, and was told that we weren't shown as being checked in. And when I say this, imagine a rather accusatory voice teling me this. I asked to be connected to the front desk to straighten it out. When connected I explained that we were trying to order room service and they were showing that we were not even in the stinking hotel. The front desk clerk tapped away on her computer and said that SHE had us as checked in (what a shock), and that she would let room service know. So I was transferred back to room service, where both of them got on the phone and told me that their computer systems were completely different and that we'd have to pay cash in order to eat! Never mind that we had a credit card on file and they'd taken extra money out that they told us could be applied to a room service bill (as long as we didn't trash the room, I assume). This is Vegas. How many people wake up with cash in their pockets? I don't, but lucky my husband had enough to pay without running to an ATM, so I called back and placed our order. Now on their menu it had buttermilk pancakes listed. This is Vegas where it seems like whatever you want to eat you can get it, so I asked the woman, \"Can we get a fruit topping on the pancakes instead of the syrup?\" She paused then said, \"I don't even know what you mean! Fruit topping? What? We don't have fruit.....\" Oooooooo kkkkkkkkk.....bring the syrup. Which they did...with strawberries on the plates. So they DO have fruit - it's a miracle! (BTW, the food was very good, but was standard IHOP fare.) The day we checked out, my hubby called down to the front desk to do the quick check out. When the front desk clerk brought up our room charges she quoted him a price that was TWO NIGHTS price that would be charged to his cc. He reminded her that we had already paid for one night so there should only be one night left. She returned with \"You checked in on the 26th and are leaving today, the 28th - that's three nights.\" He kept trying to explain to her where she was wrong, and ended up having to talk with a supervisor who corrected the problem and checked us out. That was the straw that broke the camel's back for us. PH Towers may be a top rated facility in Vegas, but after we left we wished we spent our money at the Bellagio, Venetian, Wynn or Encore. The service level was really bad and irritating for the price we paid and all the hype this hotel has around it. I guess when your early twenties and looking to throw a few back and party this stuff doesn't bother you, but it made us write PH off forever.

I had never been to Vegas before, and wanted to stay on the strip, and PH Towers was perfect - its at the heart of the strip, right beside Paris, and across the street from the Bellagio, Ceasar's, and the Metroplitan. It might be the best location in Vegas!! The hotel was built as private residences / timeshares, and is well appointed, although not as opulent as the Bellagio or Trump (I checked all of these out on my stay), but for downtime after a night of indulging in Vegas, it's excellent. Planet Hollywood Casino and the Miracle Mile Mall are right there, as well as the entire Strip experience, but you can also just lounge about what might be one of the most luxurious yet unpretentious and relaxing pools in all of Vegas. Security is excellent but not overbearing, and the concierge was very helpful if you are Vegas neophyte (like me). The rooms have great views, but the higher the better - get above the 15th floor overlooking Bellagio and Paris. The kitchenette was very handy, although you wouldn't want to try and cook full on meals. Save money and stock up on adult bevvies and munchies at the local ABC in the Miracle Mile so you have more bun for the fun! The staff were friendly but not pushy, and there are lots of options for food and entertainment right at your doorstep - although I also recommend you head down to the strip and see a Cirque show. Overall, I felt like the PH Towers was a very upscale oasis from which to indulge and explore Vegas - luxurious, but not to the point where an average human would feel out of place.

We thought it was great last year but it only got better. Check-in was pretty quick. Our flight brought us in pretty early but we just slipped out to the pool to enjoy buckets of beer and the sun for a few hours until our room was ready. The bartenders at the pool bar are really fun people and they treat the people on their deck really well. Our first year we took the 2-bedroom suite which was great; this year we decided that a 1-bedroom suite was enough for us. The suite was clean and with the high-floor placement we had a great view that included the Bellagio fountains. The floor to ceiling windows and wall sized projection screen are awesome features for a hotel. The rooms are also really quiet. We had a few party people in the room beside us and we couldn\u2019t hear a thing from them once they were in their room. At the same time we also had our music playing on our room\u2019s sound system (mind you not crazy loud) and you couldn\u2019t hear a thing from the hall. It does take a few minutes to get to and from the actual strip but it\u2019s a pretty easy walk through the Mile\u2026 I am a fan of their pool. It is a lot more calm than some of the other party pools in Vegas but still has a fun enough scene making it a solid place to hang out. We normally hit up the bigger pools for the main chunk of the day before returning to the Towers to finish the off the sun. When you stay with PH you also get access to the Planet Hollywood pools as well \u2013 a big party scene on Saturday afternoon. The staff were very friendly, the building felt safe (attendant now at the elevators 24/7), for the size of the room it\u2019s a heck of a deal, and it\u2019s in a pretty good spot on the strip. One thing to be aware of if you plan on taking cabs back to the hotel a lot is that the light to turn in takes forever.

In all my stays at hotels in Las Vegas I have never stayed in line that long. Finally we came into our room which was awesome and no complaints about that. Then when we left the hotel and came back at 1am to park our car, the valet said that the valet parking is full. So I told him I will wait, I waited 30 minutes and saw him take out about 5 cars and I went to see for myself that there was enough parking in the valet before I tell him something, there was about 15 extra spots and when I asked him if there was any parking spots available he said that they are for some kind of production crew, then I called the manager and she said it's for timeshare owners only. I don't think 15 timeshare owners will arrive at 2am in the morning so they should a least park a car for a customer that waited 30 minutes for nothing. I've been in this hotel 6 times and this was the first time I hear that. I pay for a 5 star hotel and I want my car parked at the valet because the self parking is so far that you need to come in all the way from the mall. I told the manager that I will never come back to this hotel if I don't have my car parked. She told me to never come back! So basically had to walk through the whole mall to get to my room at 2am in the morning. At the same day I called to ask for a late checkout and they told me that they can't do it, I asked for a least to leave at 1pm, the check in for another person is at 3pm so they still have 2 hours for clean up. Every 5 star hotel that I have ever been too gives a late check out. Then we had our do not disturb sign on all the time so we don't get bothered by the cleaning crew, the lady came in 3 times and opened the door with the sign on!

I totally would like to give this hotel a ZERO star if i could. I felt so regret that I did not listen to the negative comments in tripadvisor. Everything LOOKS nice in the room, but WHOLE PLACE DOESNT FUNCTION. I checked in on a Sunday evening and i waited for more than 30 mins, which i accepted. ( there are more than 10 check in desk with only 3 staff. Totally unstaffed hotel ) I paid $20 tips for the staff and ask for a \"complementary upgrade\" and he took my money and gave me a room at 26th floor. Well its a King bed studio which is EXACTLY what i booked. Okay its fine for me (even he took my money) but when i started unpacking and open the closet mirror door it ALMOST FELT OVER on me. Somehow that heavy mirror door was not even INSTALLED PROPERLY. I was kinda upset and went back to the front desk and asked for a room change. The guy apologize (which is the ONLY apologize I have received so far) and then got me a room on 52nd floor. Well the room on 52nd has better view but thats all. The room is not totally clean I found used tissue in the side table drawer. I went out for dinner and came back around 11pm and I realised there was WATER LEAKING ALL OVER THE BATHRROOM and the WALKWAY. The floor is those kinda shiny tiles so it is SO SLIPPY and dangerous. I went back to ask for a room change and a different woman staff told me she could gave me a room on 7th floor or got me an engineer to check it. Well I dont want a 7th floor room facing carpark so I waited for the engineer to come at the MIDNIGHT and HE COULD NOT FIX IT. He basically did not know where the water came from and swipe it with the towel and left. OKAY I accepted it as an one time incident but IT HAPPENED AGAIN on the second night/ third day morning. I woke up at 6am for bathroom and I JUST SLIPPED because the \"magic water\" appeared AGAIN. This time I went to the front desk and express my concern and the woman said nothing for apology except gave me a room on 51st floor and asked for my number to be contacted by the \"manager\" Well I am in my third room now and THERE IS STILL PROBLEM.

We literally sat in our car for 20 minutes with absolutely no acknowledgement from any of the 4 valets. We finally went up to one of them who advised valet is full and we would have to use self-parking (which is what we wanted to do anyway, but it would have been nice to have received instructions on both options when we arrived, not 20 minutes later after being ignored). Walking through the lower level arrival lobby, the white leather barcelona chairs were filthy and already worn out looking (remember this is only a 2 year old hotel). Then went up the escalator to the main lobby and check-in line, which didn\u2019t have the usual roped corrals to keep the line organized. While in the check-in line up, there were 4 staff working the \u201cVIP/Owners\u201d check-in desk, which was completely empty the whole 45 minutes we were waiting in the regular line. They periodically came over to the regular check-in line, asking \u201cVIP/Owners?\u201d to bring them, if any, to the separate check-in desk. In any other hotel, the VIP desk chips in to help the regular check-in desk when they\u2019re not busy. Not the case at PH Towers. They literally stood around the VIP desk chatting amongst themselves with nothing to do and their backs toward the big regular check-in line. When we finally got to an agent to check-in, we expressed our frustrations with the parking issues. Her only reply was the hotel was built with only 50 valet stalls and they were already full. Not the point. We simply would have appreciated direction from the parking staff on valet and self parking options upon arrival, not 20 minutes later. We also commented on the long wait to check in. She replied telling us they had 600 check-outs and 600 check-ins that day, hence the extended wait time. A hotel this size wouldn\u2019t have this problem if sufficiently staffed. Then we entered the elevator to go up to our room. All the elevators had some damage to them e.g. signs ripped off, floor numbers scratched off, etc. We then got up to the 25th floor for our room. The hallway walls were all marked and gouged up, the drywall with large chips in many places (again, this is only a 2 year old hotel). Finally we entered our room, which at first glance looked great, and huge. It was the 1 bedroom suite and around 950 square feet. But as soon as we started unpacking we noticed many maintenance and housekeeping issues e.g. gum stuck in the carpet in 2 places, carpet not vacuumed (potato chip crumbs all over the place), crumbs on the kitchen bar stools, bedroom drawers extremely dusty/had hairs, practically every single wall had greasy hand marks from floor to ceiling, the headboard had some kind of splash marks all over it, cupboard door for the washer/dryer combo unit in the bathroom vanity didn\u2019t close properly. Overall it didn\u2019t feel comfortable due to the dirty state of the room. We called housekeeping and a manager came up right away, who promised to have the room re-cleaned thoroughly while we were out, which they did, but was still a marginal job. Then finally at check-out returning our room cards at the front desk, we overheard another couple beside us also complaining about several things wrong with their room, similar to our issues i.e. dirty, things in disrepair. The front desk agent was writing down an extensive list.

This hotel is aimed at young singles and couples and i would not advise families or anyone wanting a peaceful experience to stay here. The Hotel is situated in the heart of the strip and has good access to shops, restaurants, other hotels and shows. The low points of our stay were the hotel staffs customer service as when we checked in we provided our credit card details as a deposite. This information was lost by the hotel and my wife recieved a phone call asking to provide it again. As we were on our way out my wife said she would bring it to the check in desk in the morning. When we returned we were locked out of the room and accused of not paying for the room. We were spoken to in a rude manor, embarrassed as they said infront of a que of people our card had been declined and yet the next morning the card was accepted and we payed for the room in full. After all the the confusion around the credit card we spoke with the manager, who was very helpful and quickly refunded our international calls to compensate for the mix up. Another area that lets this hotel down is the cleanliness of the rooms. We did not have our room changed and made up daily, we were left short of clean towels and the room was not dusted or hoovered for the entire stay.

It wasn't as big as I thought it would be. Oh its was a one bedroom suite. The two bedroom suite was a lot more spacious. The bathroom was pretty neat with the stalls one shower and one toilet. The bed was amazing, we found the pullout just got in the way and ended up taking the mattress out and putting it on the floor. ALOT more room that way. It wasn't too bad in price.

This was to be a three day getaway for my 18 year old son and myself to regroup and plan for the next chapter of our lives. It's a five hour drive from where we live in California to Las Vegas (well, it's really a six hour drive for those who obey the speed limit). As we drove straight through we were anxious to get to our hotel and get settled. I found it a bit irritating that the valet service at PH Towers is reserved for timeshare owners only. It took a bit of time to figure out the self park garage but after a few trips up, down and around we realized that you DON'T have to walk through the shopping mall to get to the garage! It took about 30 minutes for us to locate a decent parking spot, roll our bags to the hotel and get to the front desk for check-in. Checking-In was rather painless. We waited for three people in line before us and it all moved fairly quick. Upon presenting my confirmation paperwork to the clerk, I asked for a quiet non-smoking room as I have terrible allergies. The clerk advised me that the entire hotel is non-smoking. I inturn advised her that I am a world traveller and know from experience that people smoke in their rooms no matter what the policy. She told me that there was a $200 fine for those who do. I responded politely and asked that she assure that the room she assigned us was clean, quiet and clear of smoke. She upgraded us from a lower floor to a fabulous 50th floor suite at no charge. Kudos to you, Ms. Clerk. The Suite: I wish I'd had my camera out when we opened the door to our one bedroom suite. As we entered, the room darkening shades automatically raised to surprise us with an awesome view. My son about dropped to the floor in awe (photo opp!). The livingroom was clean and orderly with a giant L-shaped leather sofa and two comfy easy chairs to enjoy the large flat screen TV or projection unit which shows on the 8 foot screen that doubles as a window shade. Also, an attached kitchen sporting full size refrigerator with ice/water in the door, dishwasher, microwave, electric cooktop, toaster, blender and coffee maker. Dishes, pots and pans, glassware, utensils and cleaning supplies were also provided. Dining table seats six with another flat screen TV to enjoy while eating. In the bedroom, FABULOUS furniture including super-comfy king size bed with tons of pillows, contemporary chaise lounge placed by the floor to ceiling window to enjoy the view, large spa tub, tons of drawer space, big closet and an electronic wall safe to protect your valuables when not in the room. And...another flat panel TV! In the bathroom, double sinks, lots of light, separate toilet and shower stalls and tons of towels. There's even a European style LG washer/dryer unit hidden under the vanity and yes, a small TV mounted on the wall! After all this, we did experience a few hic-ups with our room but nothing to complain to the staff about. We understand the meaning of GREEN and were absolutely okay with re-using our towels and cleaning up after ourselves for the short length of time we stayed. On the downside: In the kitchen, the dishwasher was beeping as it was stopped mid-cycle prior to our arrival. It took about a minute to figure out what the noise was but an easy fix by simply closing the door and allowing the cycle to finish. In the livingroom, no sheets or blankets on the hide-a-bed. We had to call for linens but were surprised at how quickly they arrived after phoning one time using the ANYTHING/ANYTIME button on the suite telephone. In the bathroom, the BLACK toilet (yikes, thought those went out in the 80s) was low-flow and did not flush away all toilet paper the first time. Not a big deal but a little annoying. The shower door did not fit properly so water did end up on the tile floor creating a slip-n-fall situation as there was more water than the towel that we used for the missing bathmat could soak up. Again, no big deal, just a little annoying. In the bedroom, the carpet just inside the door from the bathroom was pulling up ever so slightly and created a hazard for tripping. There was no iron or ironing board in the closet as advertised on the website where we ordered the room, not a bother for us as we were all about jeans for this trip. Lastly, there was no telephone book or writing supplies in the suite. Internet was available for a charge of $19.99 for three days. We thought it should have been included. We did not use the pool, business center or fitness room so we cannot comment on them for this stay. We did eat at a few of the restaurants in the adjoining mall and enjoyed them all. The ABC liquor store in the mall had everything we were looking for including moderately priced spirits for me and snacks for my son. The store was organized and the clerk was helpful and nice. We are not big shoppers but we did look in the windows at many of the stores and boutiques in the adjoining mall and were surprised by the number of people exiting with purchases and treasures. Certainly these shoppes must have moderately priced goods as the number of people walking around with multiple bags was surprising! All in all, our stay at PH Towers was a nice one. We didn't come across any pushy time-share sales people, loud parties, falling down drunks, nasty staff or inconvienient walks to and from parking, shopping or casinos. What we did experience was a reasonably priced hotel that stood up to our expectations and a great three day turn-around to our favorite city in the west.

CONS: It's a young, less-than-desirable party crowd (of course - because the big rooms are inexpensive!) Everyone at the hotel had one of those neon yellow yards of daiquiri in their hand at all times.

The PH Towers are connected to Planet Hollywood by the Miracle Mile shops which is great for a day, but then gets old. There are no really good eateries in the mall either. The pool was a ZOO. Don't get me wrong, it was a nice pool, had a pool bar and a DJ, but you had to fight for chairs. Overall, it was perfect for what we wanted.

As far as some of the comments on parking are concerned, it was actually a very short walk from the Self-Parking garage to the PHT check-in desk and high speed elevators, especially as compared to a typical strip property. HINT: You can enter the Miracle Mile Shops parking garage from Audrie Lane, which is 1 block off the Strip. Park on the 3rd Level, and then walk over to the Southwest corner to get to the PHTower. You don't have to walk through the Miracle Mile shops, unless you want to. The super large Projection Screen TV was very cool to have, although we didn't watch much TV while we were staying there. I could imagine watching it a lot more during NCAA Football season, or the March Madness basketball t ournament. For a screen that big, the resolution was pretty good. The kitchen had a full size stainless steel GE refrigerator/freezer, microwave, and dishwasher. There was a table for 6 with really nice chairs. I counted 5 TV's including the projection screen TV. If you can find a decent deal on-line, I think you will absolutely love this place. We got our reservation and a good price through BOOKIT.com. We will absolutely try and stay there again.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Artesia, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and fantastic room\u201d", "Author": "L_tween_mom", "ReviewID": "UR116029508", "Content": "Mom came with my daughter and a friend of hers.

Great positioning in the middle of the strip and only a short walk through the shopping area while keeping cool to the strip. Some reviews have said that there was a long queue at checkin but we had no such problem just a couple of minutes wait at most. The only problem that I encounted was a blown light bulb which was fixed in a short space of time. I must say that all the staff I spoke to were lovely and kept us entertained throughout our time there. My brother was staying here at PH Towers with us for the first time and he has stayed in alot of other hotels on the strip including some of the big names.

Also, so many things like the large screen TV and the fridge with filtered water were just added luxuries! However, so many other things are wrong about this hotel. Check in was a longggg wait, with only 2 employees on. We were there when the Miss America Pageant was being held, and the contestants stayed in the PH Towers. BOOOOO! These young ladies were loud, rude, drunk, annoying and barfing/passing out. Of course the hotel catered to them ($$$$ signs in their eyes). If you enjoy this environment, this is the hotel for you! One evening I arrived at the Tower elevators to go to my room, to be greeted by Police, Paramedics and tons of Hotel Security. That same night around 3 a.m. Security opened the door to our hotel room with a pass key, called out Hello till we were all awake and all answered, and then ordered us to put on all the extra security locks! To say the least we were not impressed. How safe were we? The other issues are no taxi's are ever available. No doormen work the door. They have no staff. Also the pool was honestly, awful!!! Not a speck of shade to be had, and any umbrella's they did have they took away from people and placed in the areas they rented for $$$$$. And there they sat, no one using them. The pool manager was the rudest man EVER! He took an umbrella from two elderly ladies sitting under it and was absolutely arrogant towards them.

I read some of the negative comments after I booked the holiday and thought I would review exactly as we found our holiday and comment on it thereafter. We arrived close to midnight and were dropped off by taxi at the main entrance which required us to go up one floor (by escalator or elevator) to the main lobby (some comments had suggested that you have to walk through the mall to get to the hotel, this is simply not true). We were attended to by a very polite and helpful check-in clerk and were on our way to our room in less than 5 minutes, there was a security check and the person on duty was very polite but did ensure that only guests that were staying at the hotel were allowed to the rooms. The room was amazing, the decor is red and black but looks (and is) really high class and is definitely worthy of a 5 star rating, the electric blind was amazing and the views were great (we were on the 37th floor). We have an 18 month old son and every day of our stay we were in the swimming pool (and the spa pool too), the swimming area was very good and I was very happy to see at least 2 lifeguards around the pool at all times. The attendants on duty at the pool were very friendly and after being to the pool a couple of times they even greeted my little boy by name. I found the hotel very clean and had a wonderful atmosphere. The hotel is linked to the mall which allows you to do all day shopping, get food 24hrs a day and if you are going to the strip an air-conditioned walk along the way. We loved the Spice Market Buffet and went there very often during our stay and found that it had a great variety and was good value for money. This morning we checked out to return home and were able to do the check out on the TV, very efficient. Our stay was 5 star and we will definitely return to the PH Towers Las Vegas again. I think it is good to give feedback on positive and negative trip experiences but feel the majority of us only give negative feedback when we feel we have not had great service, I feel some of the negative criticism is unfair and would encourage more people to review this hotel.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, British Columbia", "Title": "\u201cTime Share Beware\u201d", "Author": "dillydally77", "ReviewID": "UR115919185", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the PH Towers in July 2011. The hotel is a time share property and we were targeted by the time share staff the moment we entered the lobby. Time share people have a way of smooth talking and purposely not stating their motives up front. Think used car salesmen. Do not trust the time share people and try to politely avoid engaging in conversation with them unless of course you are genuinely interested. We stayed in a studio suite and the rooms were modern and spacious. There was a comfy king sized bed, LCD TV, living room area with a sofa and coffee table, bathroom with double sinks, tub/shower combo (the tub was jetted but it was small and the cleanliness of it was questionable) and a toilet with a sliding door to seperate it from the rest of the bathroom. Conveniently the PH Towers were connected to the Miracle Mile Shops through the lobby and you could walk to the Planet Hollywood Resort which is also connected to the mall (5min walk). The Planet Hollywood Resort is where the actual casino, restaurants and buffet were. The hotel is also centrally located on the strip across from Aria and Cosmopolitan and beside Paris and MGM. Eventhough we didn't want room service and had the 'No room service' light turned someone had clearly entered the room while we were out and cleaned our room. This happened every night. So remember to put your valuables in the safe even if you aren't expecting room service because they most likely will come in. In hindsight we probably should have complained about this because it was rather annoying. Another thing that should be mentioned is that we noticed that the general age range of the hotel guests was twenty-something. So if you're out of your twenties, which we were, you may feel a little out of place. All in all the hotel did have nice, large, modern rooms and the hotel itself is situated in a good central location on the strip and reasonably priced for what you get.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cRecommend staying here.\u201d", "Author": "jovanar", "ReviewID": "UR115918538", "Content": "I stayed here for my friends birthday last weekend.

We had a car for 2weeks so the day we arrived we went to Walmart and stocked up on water,beer and wine along with other bits and bobs. We ordered a pizza carry out one night from a leaflet which was put through our door. Be prepared to wait but it was worth the wait. We had our breakfast in the room most mornings which saved money, but I must recommend the Spice Market Buffet in Planet Hollywood. We went there twice and was not disappointed..We went down to the pool area the 2nd day and there were towels on all the beds and as it was quite early thought they cant be all full already as this was a Thursday, but my husband went to check and they put the towels on the beds for the people to use which is a good touch, but a lot of people thought the beds were taken. We also took water to the pool and they have drink fountains where you can fill your bottles up. It does get busy on a Friday and Saturday but it did not bother us.

To start with, we checked in pretty late since our flight was 5 hours late so it was close to 10pm we waited for like 15 min, and got excellent service, I tried getting an upgrade to a 1 room suite but they were all booked, however i got offered a room on the 54th floor for 10bucks extra a night and it was worthy, the view was amazing. I have no one complaint about the room, or the service, bed was confy and the room was pretty big (we had friends staying at Monte carlo, flamingo and Mandalay bay and our room was by far the best), we decided not to get room service the first two days and we just kept getting calls from the staff to see if we needed it, got it the third day and it was great. Its awesome how its connected to the mall, we found breakfast for 6 bucks a plate, cheap booze at the ABC stores, great sandwiches at Earls of Sandwich, and theres is this sports bar there called Blondies where we paid 20 bucks for all the beer we could drink and played beer pong (best deal of the trip, I think they do that every thursday) The walk to the strip is not bad, I didnt mind it, not even when I was drunk. We went to the pool once for like 30 min and it was pumping, great music lots of young people partying it up. If I had to say something bad about the hotel, it would be that I did walk by the lobby at 3pm and the check in line looked big, not sure if people had to wait long, it just looked busy. Also I read reviews where people complain about the walls, we didnt have problem sleeping any of the nights, but the lady staying beside us kept knocking on our door i guessing telling us to keep it down, but it was 10pm, not 2 so we didnt really care. We also got room service one night, and it was a bit pricey, and took long since it was coming from the PH hotel, but it was pretty tasty, awesome food.

From the outside, especially at night, it looks fantastic, but that is deceiving. First strike was driving up and finding valet parking only for \"owners\". Was forced/corralled to drive around and get lost for 30 min trying to find a spot to park. Turns out you have to haul your luggage through Magnificent Miles shops to even reach the front desk. There, almost an hour shot. The lobby looks like it started off as a nice concept then the money ran out - seating areas were unclean and one even had a group of what looked to be homeless men sitting around drinking cheap whiskey and gin. Arrive at the room hot and sweaty from hauling the luggage through the mall and expecting to be Wow\u2019ed, but never happened. The Embassy Su*tes we stayed at the night before was cleaner and more upscale than this room. The bed skirt was all grey and crooked and the only piece of furniture besides the bed and sofa was a dinged up tiny desk. There were not even any drawrrs to organize gear. And the closet had an iron but no ironing board. If you want ice, prepare for a hike \u2013 ice machines on only the 5th and 50th floors, and both broken, so you\u2019ll need to venture out to the Miracle Mile shops and buy some at the ABC store. The description said separate bath and shower. Nope. The shower/tub combo even had chunks of trim missing. Heaven forbid you should turn on the jets \u2013 you\u2019ll just end up filling the bath water with goop that has been building up in the plumbing that is obviously not maintained. In my room, you couldn\u2019t even turn of the jets. The switch was broken. We had to have a repairman come up to our room at 11:30PM to turn the darn thing off. Needless to say this ruined the romantic mood. Strike 2! And when I explained to a manager, she made it sound like they were doing us a favor by sending someone to fix it. (BTW, can you imagine the roar of water jets in a small hotel room all through the night? That was what we almost had to endure.) The next night we came back at 2:00AM after a fantastic show and expensive dinner to find that housekeeping didn\u2019t bother coming to make the bed and change out towels. So after hearing the phone ring at least 30 times, I tried calling on my cell phone as if I was calling to make a reservation. An operator picked up on the second ring while I still had the hotel phone ringing in my other ear. Amazing! I guess they figure once you are there and paid your money, they can mess with you and send you on your way without ever having to talk to you. So going through the reservation line was the only way to get someone to hear. Housekeeping came up with more towels and again, romantic mood ruined. Strike 3! Again, I am so disappointed. I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy! Incidentally, I stayed at the PH main hotel back in December and it was great. Must be different people running this Tower hotel. Oh yea, there was one good thing: you don\u2019t have to walk through a casino to get to the elevators. Also, if you like blaring music from the pool coming into your room on the 25th floor, you might like this hotel. But if you try going down to the pool, you are on your own. No attendants (plenty of cocktail waitresses) so all the chairs have towels and you can\u2019t tell which ones are free to use. Stay Away from this place!

The customer \"service\" people I talked to were either rude, dismissive, or flat out insulting. At one point, I spent 40 minutes on hold to get in touch with a manager.

Check in at the Towers was quick...no wait at all (by contrast, we accidentally got dropped off at Planet Holywood hotel. Line there had hundreds of people in it!) We had a free upgrade to one-bedroom suite, which was a very nice deal. One bedroom suite has large living room with L-shaped sectional couch (folds out to queen size bed) Two side chairs, coffee table, large flat-screen TV on wall. Full-wall floor-to-ceiling window with electric black-out shade. The shade doubles as screen for projector in case you want to watch movies. Kitchen has full size fridge, microwave, dishwasher, stove-top, oven and dishes/glassware etc for 4. Personal size (one cup at a time) coffee maker with supplies; dish detergent, dishwasher detergent included. Fridge has filtered water/ice maker dispenser. Bedroom has a king-size bed, large chaise lounge, desk/extra large dresser combination, flat-screen TV, very deep whirlpool tub. Bathroom includes a washer-dryer machine (one-load box of laundry detergent included.) Bathroom amenities are nice products (shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, bars of hand & bath soap, shower cap.) Place is ultra-modern, glitzy decor (lots of mirrors & polished surfaces, black/white/red color scheme, Hollywood icon pictures. We had a Warhol-like Marilyn Monroe print on the wall in our living room) Furniture in Living room & kitchen is comfortable and functional. These are meant to be time-share suites, so it's a full kitchen & living arrangement. Gorgeous view from our window (to the left was the main Planet Hollywood hotel, and just beside that we could see most of the Eiffel Tower (gorgeous to see at night, lit up) and off to the far right ...we could see planes landing at airport and also see the mountains beyond. We were far enough away there is no airplane noise, though. We had a great price on the suite (abount $130 night, booked through BookIt.com) Public Areas are very well maintained...security is good (you have to show a room key or time share owner ID to even get to the elevator hallway at the Towers) Employees are all friendly and helpful. Maid service was timely, and very helpful...asking if we needed any extra supplies. Now for the downside...noise levels not good here. You can here people walking by & talking in the hallways when you're on the far side of the suite. You can here every bit of partying in the suite next door (was a batchelor party of some-such going on one night...got to listen to the chugging music way too long. Was really thankful I'd brought my white-noise machine!) Two of the nights we were there, a family was staying in the suite above because we could here the kids both nights playing in the living room. I think we were very lucky that the Towers were not near full...most of the time we were there I don't think anyone was in the rooms on either side of us other than the one bachelor-party night. But if this place was full, the noise from other rooms could have been a constant irritant. And really not much privacy insde this suite either...none of the doors quite cover the openings...bedroom door is this massive, highly polished, 7 ft tall, 3 ft wide glamor deal...looked like a wood safe or something...very \"Hollywood\" looking...must have cost a pretty penny. But it had big enough gaps around the top of the door that you could see the ceiling of the next room. Same with bathroom exterior doors -- solid wood panel doors, but gaps tops & bottom. The Bathroom is decorated in black & white (toilet is black...ug. Did not care for that at all. No way to see if the thing is clean!) The bathroom is huge, with a walk-in double shower, and a separate toilet compartment. But the doors on these two areas are glass, and do not actually cover. Fan in bathroom (if there is one) is totally silent and the entire bathroom is tile so all \"personal\" noises are shared throughout the suite, sorry for TMI, but I think it's silly these hotels build these beautiful looking bathrooms that fail on function! Speaking of which...there's a television built into the bathroom. But you can't use the outlets in the bathroom without blowing the circuit breakers (low wattage curling iron that works fine everywhere else we've ever gone...tripped the circuit breakers in this bathroom.) There is a blow dryer in the suite which can be run on the bathroom circuit, but it was very difficult to use...cord is about 18 inches long so you have to tilt head at odd angle to use the blow dryer because cord is so short. And worst of all...the nasty sewer smell coming from the sinks in the suite. We called about it (started out as a small smell that grew worse day to day) They sent a maintenance guy. He seemed to know right away what we were talking about and said he had chemicals to put down the drains that would take care of the issue immediately. So he left to get the stuff...dumped it down & it seemed to work. He also noticed a burnt-out lightbulb & changed that while he was there. By the next day, I thought the smell was coming back, but others did not. Turns out, it was. Was bad enough the others could smell it the next day. We called again about it, but actually got checked out before anyone showed up. Don't know what the issue is with those drain pipes, but dumping some liquid drain deodorizer down them is not fixing it. The pool is nice here, well-maintained with plenty of lounge chairs, full bar and some food service at the pool bar...BUT the pool is only open from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM. In other words, during the hottest part of the day when the sun is beating down. Was 90 F at 9:00 AM...and 110 F. at 3:00 PM. Hubby and adult daughter would both have loved to go swimming in the evening -- once the sun was no longer directly overhead, and the worst heat was past (though it was still in the 90s at 7:00 PM) But everthing at the pool was stacked up/locked up tight in the evenings. Obviously they want people in the casinos & restaurants in the evening, not enjoying the pool. Location of the hotel is good...Planet Hollywood Resort/Casino is directly on the Strip, next to Paris Las VEgas & across the street from the Bellagio...the Towers are connected to the main Planet Hollywood building by walking through the Miracle Mile Shops. Lots of restaurants in the Miracle Mile Shops, and in the Planet Hollywood hotel, as well as several theaters with typical Las Vegas show offerings. Bottom line is...we wanted so much to like this hotel.

I have to deduct 1 star due to the loud music and young men sleeping on the sofas in the lobby. I considered booking elsewhere after reading reports of the service here. I am so happy we stayed. Checked in on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend at 5PM, plenty of hosts at the desk. Our experience was fast and easy. There was a mix up with our reservations, the clerk checked the back office for a few minutes and everything was cleared up. I did not hear any customers complaining at check in and there were several of us there. The room was just as pictured on web site, and it is very large. The room itself is 5 stars. We were on the 16 floor, looked over the pool, toward the MGM and the airport with City Center to the right.. We were constantly looking out the window. We kept the due not disturb light on the whole week. Housekeeping left voice mails (they do that without ringing the phone) to check that we needed anything or to schedule a cleaning. We let them in on Wednesday to change beds and replace towels and a mild cleaning while we were there. They checked on us daily but we were happy just spreading out all over the room and did not want to neaten up for the maids. Concierge was very helpful with scooter and car rental. Pool was very nice, you could sit in the part that had about 6 inches of water, hang your legs in the pool and read. I spent ours there with my nook. Liked it better after the first day, I brought earplugs. This is where I realized this pool is for the young crowd. Loud music, and not my choice of music. But these young people were all considerate and well behaved. No loud mouths, and quite interesting to listen to. Location gets 5 stars. We walked to almost all the other hotels, a few a day. We enjoyed the walk through the mall in the morning (except for the loud music) but it did seem longer at night when we returned. There are a lot of hawkers at this mall trying to grab you at the kiosks and some stores. There some very interesting stores and art galleries. I think we were in ABC everyday for water, qtips, blister bandaids etc. Ate at PF Changs, Earl of Sandwich, both very good. Breakfast every morning was next door at Mon Ami Gabi, on the patio. We just loved it there in the morning. I am very happy we stayed at PH Towers this trip, it was perfect location and huge room for 6 days. I would definitely recommend with 5 stars to anyone under 40. Over that, I would tell about my great experience and suggest earplugs at the pool. We never heard a sound in our room during the night. The music is at the pool and lobby and mall. You could hear the pool music in the room Friday afternoon as it started to get busy and the party atmosphere was getting started, but we knew it closed soon and wold not go on all night. I still don't understand why there was always young men sleeping on the sofas in the lobby late at night.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cLOVED IT!!\u201d", "Author": "JoJobah", "ReviewID": "UR114387022", "Content": "PH Towers was amazing.

One of the great things about this room is that it has a mini kitchenette that comes with a dishwasher, a tiny sink, fridge and a microwave/convection oven combo. It was great! we picked up a few groceries and a made a couple of meals ourselves which saved money AND calories! The walk from the hotel to the strip is NOT 10 mins as some reviews claim. We are both in our thirties and walked a normal pace. maybe took us 4-5 mins at the most. It was great because when my husband wanted to sleep in, i would go down the to the Starbucks and walk around the mall. It was very convenient being right in the mall. Drinks at the pool are expensive!!! $29 for two drinks (margarita and a pina colada), you can get them charged to the room. Checkout was fantastic! So easy. You can check out on the TV. Wifi is not free but it is at the Starbucks downstairs in the Casino. The fitness room is bright and clean, The only downfall of the gym is that there was no sanitizer for the equipment.

A young lady(I will conceal her name for her protection) helped us and I decided to try the $20 sandwich trick. Gave her my id/$20/credit card sandwich and didnt say anything about it. She upgraded us from a King Studio to a high floor King One Bedroom w/ strip view. Her attitude was friendly and she made us feel very welcomed. The room: Everything you see from their website. Modern decor, lots of HDTV's, & kitchen. The bed was soft and had lots of pillows. A safe is in the closet and easy to use. The room was huge! BTW when you leave you can check-out on the TV it is supper easy and should become a hotel standard! The staff: Everyone we encouterd was extremely friendly. The maid was cleaning the Penthouse unit next to our room and let us walk around and view the room. Our room was cleaned well, towels were replaced, and my personal items were left untouched. We left $5 tip everyday with a note to housekeeping thanking them. I think its nice to be friendly to the people who pickup after your sloppy mess. We never encoutered timeshare sales people. Unless your a Vegas rookie you should know how to blow off pushy sales people. Swimming pool: Wet Republic its not. But that is a good thing. We did the pool partys Ditch Fridays, and Hardrock. At the end of the day we would have one last drink and dip at the PH Toweres pool just to relax a little bit Location: Cant beat center strip.

After reading all the reviews here, I must admit that I was pretty nervous. But DON'T listen to the picky reviews. Expect a mid-range hotel, which is what I think it is. The lobby is contemporary, modern and clean. We checked in around 12:30 pm with NO line up at all. The front desk girl was lovely and offered us an upgraded room on the 51st floor (at an additional charge) which we took. The room was perfect size for us with a spectacular view. The additional charge was worth every penny for this view, we faced Wynn from the master bedroom and Paris from the living room. We had no problems with housekeeping or front desk service, however when Friday came around of course the hotel is going to be busy. Give these people a break, the hotel is BUSY, of course service will suffer a little bit....it's the weekend in Vegas, what do you expect?! The pool was fabulous and because we were there midweek it was quite and perfect, again once the weekend rolled around it got very busy. Location is phenomenal and we loved that it was connected to the mall, it was a break from walking outside because it was melting hot. All in all, this is a great value for the price. Go with an open mind and remember that these people that work in these hotels work HARD. We would definitely go back again. I would not hesitate to tell anyone to book here. *Tips: if you rent a car, park on the 3rd floor in self parking lot and to the left is an entrance directly to the lobby so you don't have to walk through the mall.

We had the suite plus the studio. Very nice and large. Really like the modern look. Could tell from our first trip that housekeeping is not doing as well as the first trip. Carpet was wet in a large spot. Not sure what that was. Was not as clean this trip. Hair on the floor, something had ran doen the frig and not wipped off. Remote would not work. Found out a part of the TV was unplugged from wall. One missing remote. Just not the cleaning that you would expect from a 5 star. Hallways could be cleaner too. Called to report issues had to get a little up set for someone to come check. Someone very kind came in less than 10 mintes. Was there for 3 nights, housekeeping does not come by. Make sure you hang up your towels and clean up after yourself. Did not want to wash on my vacation. These things are really not that bad. Here is where the BAD TASTE comes from. Went to the time share presentation. Not wanting to purchase at all. 4 hours later we had bought at one of the Floriada properties. Only becuse I was told that an all inclusive week vacation would not cost any extra. Only the fee of the international travel and disconnected airfare. I asked this question I know 4 times. Was told yes that is all you have to pay. Out right lied to by Krista Smith sales manager. Our sales rep agreed with Krista. (Joe Dandy) Why do people feel like they must lie to you to sell a product. If what you are selling is for real it should sell it self. When I got home within 2 days I emailed Krista, twice. Do you think she took the time to answer me NO!!!!!! I made many phone calls for her to return a call to me. As a matter of fact no type of management will call you back or speak to me. Makes you think that they all do business in lies to people. Take your money and run, guess that is their motto Checked out the reviews on the property where went bought our week. ( Westgate Blue Tree) The reviews were not good at all, doesn't sound like a 5 star property that Westgate said all their property were. Another lie to us!!!! WOW. I wanted Krista Smith or someone to price out an all inslusive with air leaving from my home airport. No responce from anyone on this. Have asked this of Westgate personnal maybe 6 times. I want my money back and cancel this fraud of a timeshare. So skinny of this please don't waste your time n Vegas going to their lies of a presentation just for some show tickets. Go pay for yoru ticket yourself. Check out tickets 4 2nite. Lession well learned on my part. Have been to many presentations over the years wonder why I thought this one was different??????

We literally just got home. If decent service in a hotel matters to you, then absolutely do NOT stay there. This is a long review, if you don't want to read the whole thing just read points # 6 & 7. That should be reason enough not to stay there. My husband and I went for a short 2 night stay to get away and have some fun. We are a laid back couple in our mid twenties and this hotel is geared for people our age. We like to consider ourselves pretty well traveled for our age, and always stay in 4 or 5 star hotels (because we believe you get what you pay for). This is by no means a 4 star hotel. I did the Priceline Bid, typed in 4 star hotel or better for $80 a night and ended up with the Planet Hollywood Towers. I never would have chosen to stay there, but I figured for $80 a night I couldn't complain. Man was I wrong... 1. When we checked in we were bombarded by a woman trying to get us to sit in on a presentation for free dinner vouchers. When we politely declined she gave us major attitude and made checking in an annoying process. 2. When we got to our room, the smell of the cleaning supplies was so bad my husband could literally taste it in his mouth and his nose was burning. There were no cups in our room, we had to call for them, and when they arrived they were dirty! When I held them up to the light I could see lipstick marks! We found a bra next to the couch and a stash of naked hooker cards in the nightstand drawer. Gross. And the outside panel on the bath tub was completely broken, you could see all the electrical stuff for the jets inside. (I didn't complain about anything because every time we called downstairs I would be put on hold for 10 minutes before I got to speak to someone, if they even picked up in the first place. I did not want to spend my 2 day vacation waiting on hold on the phone!). 3.We really wanted to see a show, but the entire time we were there the Concierge was bombarded by people. There was only one person working the Concierge the entire time. When I tried to call down to the Concierge (about 10 times) I never got an answer. I left messages only to never be called back. We never got any information about shows and therefore we didn't see one. In my opinion a 4 star hotel should have a much more attentive Concierge staff. 4. We needed toilet paper yesterday and called three separate times to get it. Finally someone brought it up after an hour... 5. We ordered room service for some appetizers before we went out (which stops at the Towers at 2pm, and after that, they are sending it over from the Planet Hollywood) and the chicken wings were so disgusting they were inedible. The chicken quesadilla was good. I'll give them that. 6. Housekeeping barged in our room at 10:30 am this morning and yells \"When are you checking out?\" ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! We had the do not disturb light on!!! Checkout time is 11am!! We were naked!! Enough said on that one. 7. They shut down the elevator system at 1:00 am last night because someone had sprayed the fire extinguisher all over one of the elevators. I understand that this was out of the hotels hands, but they had NO ONE over by the elevators telling their guests what was going on. There was a crowd of drunk people (us included) that just wanted to get to our rooms and were being given no information! When we went over to the front desk to ask where the stairs were, they couldn't tell us where they were! Three different people at the front desk didn't know where the stairs were. We waited around for 30 minutes until we decided to take the second set of elevators to a different floor and then walked down 10 flights of stairs. I happened to see many disabled guests in the hotel, and I wondered how they were being taken care of in a situation like that... completely unacceptable. 8. There was no ice machine on our floor (19), we had to walk down to the 5th floor to get it, and last night it was broken. A couple good things I will say about the hotel: The rooms are kinda cute, beds are pretty comfortable, and the TVs are nice. We went and ate at Koi last night at the Planet Hollywood and it was amazing! We had a great time when we were outside the Towers ;) We ended up talking to the manager when we checked out because we wanted them to know how unhappy we were. If maybe one or two of these things happened during our stay, that would be understandable. I wouldn't be making a big deal. Not every hotel can be perfect. But the fact that it was just one thing after another was upsetting. The manager credited me back the room service charge for $60.00. That was all he could do because I had already pre paid the hotel through Priceline. That was nice of him, but I still felt that he didn't really care. He kept interrupting us when we were trying to tell him about our stay. So, overall, there are much better places to stay!

However the other way might face the multi storey car park, so get the pool, main road side! HOUSE KEEPING - They were almost gagging to clean the room, and even left messages on the phone to check you didnt need it cleaning, they knocked on the door, in the afternoon, and spoke in person on the phone to make sure we were happy for them to not clean etc, also security fixed our safe that was broken within 10 mins of calling down to the front desk. Thus very helpful staff. LOCATION - If you come to Vegas and expect your room to be almost on the strip, then you will be mistaken. Vegas is massive, and you need to walk places! 10mins approx to the strip through the shops. Taxis can be got downstairs, you might need to wait a few minutes at times though. A good tip is to get the bus tickets for $7 for 24hr travel up the strip to freemont and the premium shopping outlet, it stops outside or near to all the major hotels and if you not too rushed it saves you a lot of $. The pool at the hotel was nice, lots of towels and sun beds available etc and all NO extra cost.

Takes about 5-10 mins to get to the strip depending on if you're a fast walker like myself or a senior. Really not a bad walk and scenery on the way. Best thing is you get to pass a ABC store (Mini Convenience store which sells Liquor ,souvenirs, basic food and such at great prices) and Earl of a Sanwich (best Hot/cold sanwiches for $6 ever) on your way out.

We were suppose to stay 2 nights here and 3 nights at Planet Hollywood. My gf wanted to stay here bc of the size of the rooms which looked nice and big online. So we got off our flight from Canada on May 28 10:30am which is Memorial Day weekend so everyone knows. We knew Vegas was going to be busy. So we arrived at the hotel at around 11:15am. Waited about 20 mins the 1st time, got to the counter and before I could open my mouth, she says \"Not checking anyone in until 4\". So there we went downstairs to the bell man to have him hold our bags for 4 and a half hours. What do you know.. One guy working a crowd of about 50 people checking bags early. The line just to check our bags took 30 minutes. So all this will never ruin Vegas for me because I'm here to have fun with my gf and friends. So back we came at 330pm to check in. Line took an hour to get through because 1. They are slow and 2. This is a timeshare hotel we learned and every owner (which means nothing as Vegas is so cheap) gets VIP service. The line got heated after about 30 mins with people yelling and complaining at the staff about this. The staff had no answer except that this is what they are told to do. So they had 4 people working a line of about 150 people and 4 people working a line of maybe 1-3 people max at a time. The customer service is terrible. I notified the guy at the counter that I will only stay one night and stay the Sunday and 3 more nights I had booked at the Planet Hollywood Hotel right next to it. Eventually he canceled free of charge because the line was gettin too big. Rooms were nice just like advertised. Had the view of the parking garage but I wasn't even in my room until late. And to top it all off someone knocked on my door at 9:10 am to let me know checkout is at 11am. Had enough, got our stuff left. Planet Hollywood Hotel was amazing.

Mandalay bay and Paris were both cheaper and over the top in comparison. Didn't deal much with the hotel staff just at check in and check out the latter completed on the TV so very painless. When I left to find a taxi I discovered that PH towers doesn't have any waiting ala PH itself so I would just hike over to PH and grab a cab there. They both share the underground parking and it's the quickest route to get there. 25 people standing in line at check out time for a cab and one staff member frantically trying to flag down a cab on a side street didn't work out. Take the hike to PH. Other than that I'd suggest something other than a sunday check out, the elevators were jammed on sunday people riding them up since they were full for an hour going down at 11 am. The stairs got a lot of use on Sunday. Anyway I found it a good place to stay and got a good laugh at the drunk teenagers that seemed to inhabit every floor the elevator stopped at.

This hotel is great! We arrived early in the morning on May 24th (around 10:30am), the desk clerk told us it was a little early to check in but she double checked the computer to see if anything was available at that time. She told us there was a suite on the 4th floor, but warned us that we would not have a view. We opted to wait. When we returned around noon, she found us a suite on the 19th floor - facing the airport, MGM, excaliber, etc. The view was great! If you are used to staying in regular sized hotel rooms, the studio will suit you fine! It was larger than the average hotel room - not really sure why I would need extra space! The room was exactly as the pictures showed. Clean, neat, and very trendy! The bed was a huge king sized bed with 8 pillows! Automatic blinds, room and maid service - all with the press of a button. You could also access all room amenities through the TV - which was pretty cool. Air conditioning kept the room very cool. The walls are thin, but most of the time you are either too tired and sleepy to notice any noise. The only time we were kept up was the Friday of the Memorial Day weekend (understandably), and we had to be up by 5:30 to catch the shuttle to the airport the next morning. It was a little annoying, but no biggie. Time share people were not as bad as some people have indicated. Just steer clear of them at the main entrances of the Miracle Mile Mall (they are wearing red shirts and will probably ask if you're married if you're there with a spouse). Just ignore them completely. The pool was great! Wish it was a little deeper, but it is great to cool off and enjoy a cool beverage! Lots of loungers....the big ones with red cushions are available for daily rental (around $50). A lot of cabanas too - but I didn't see anyone really using these as they are set back from the pool itself - and probably cost a pretty penny. If you can, bring cash to the pool bar - if you charge your drinks to your room, you will be charged a tipping surcharge on your final bill.

It took me 1/2 hour to check in at about 6 PM and more than 1/2 hour to check out at 10:30 PM. Why was I checking out at that hour, beacuse I had an early AM flight and was afraid that it would be just as bad in the early morning. I should point out that the staff was nice, they are just understaffed. My guess is that because of the ownership arrangement, they really do not care if visitors return. My second day in the hotel I left at 8:30 in the AM and returned at 9 PM to find that my room wasn't made up. It seems to me 13 hours should be enough time. And no, I did not have a \"do not disturb\" sign up. When I called I specifically said please do NOT come for 20 minutes because I need to wash up and change clothing. Yep, they came in 5 minutes while I was naked. When I told the chambermaid to please come back in 10 minutes, she said she's going on break and can't come back until after 10 PM. I'm serious. Want wifi? An extra charge $21 for 3 days. Come on. How many hotels in the US charge for wifi now-a-days? Like a pen or pad in your room? No luck. I like a bar of soap and the sink and in the shower. I could not get that second bar. All silly little things, but indicative of the overall feel of the place. The worst part of this property is that it offers virtually no traditional hotel conveniences. Want breakfeast? You have to walk to the attached mall and go searching for an open restaurant. Also note that it is a long walk through the mall to LV Blvd. Count on 15-20 minute hikes to most to most everything. I do not consider this convenient. My room was decorated in Hollywood decor, this is part of the Planet Hollywood complex. I had floor to ceiling windows, but it faced a roof top which was at the same level as my floor.

This suite does not have a full kitchen, just a GE Advantium microwave and small fridge, and no cookware. It also does not have a projection TV. The second time, we were in my timeshare suite, which is the larger one-bedroom suite, with a full kitchen. The cookware was about the cheapest budget cookware one can get; the certainly stinted on that. Maintenance was poor; the door was falling off the dishwasher, and a few light bulbs were burned out. A call to the concierge got the light bulbs replaced, but the dishwasher was not repairable, and they couldn't replace it. Other than that, I had no problems with the suite. All the windows were floor to ceiling, and the width of the rooms; the shades were operated by wall switches (the shade in the living room doubles as the projection-TV screen.) or from the TV remote for that room. One nice feature (in both suites) is \"turn the room off\"; it lowers the shades and turns off the TV and the lights. Although PH Towers is owned by Westgate, it is operated by Ceasers International (formally known as Harrahs), which owns the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino (and maybe Miracle Mile). They staff the registration counter and the maid and maintenance services. Westgate runs the time-share presentations (from a round service counter in the lobby) and the concierge. The only maid service, though, for timeshare stays is a cleanup on the fourth day of the stay. I understand that people staying there at hotel rates get maid service daily.

Funniest 'fact' of the day had to be that the interval brochure is only printed with a Westgate feature in it. I wish I had mine to hand so I could have shown him our Marriott version.

Thank you, Carlos! This is a great base camp for a large group. It's connected to the Miracle Mile Mall, which contains the ABC convenience stores, which sell relatively cheap booze and mix. So whatever faults the place may have, proximity to the ABC is a huge plus. Additionally, the hotel is located smack dab in the middle of the Strip, and across the street from the glitzy new Cosmopolitan. Also no casino to walk through in the lobby, which is nice if you're already overstimulated. Pool was beautiful but drinks there were expensive. The black toilet made it hard to inspect your leavings, and it was ultra low-flow and hard to get flushed properly. Only one trash can in the suite. Views from the suites are great. I felt like the hotel had few amenities--no where handy to go for breakfast, for instance. It's also something of a hike back through the mall coming off the Strip. And it's filled with young party-goers, so if you need a lot of uninterruped sleep, probably not the best choice. Be sure to bring a jacket and lip balm.

I was happy that the front desk did offer to upgrade my 2 bedroom suite to the penthouse for a reasonable price, but when I found out that the only difference was that the living room was a little bit bigger I graciously declined. It just wasn\u2019t worth the money but was still pleased that the front desk did offer and I didn\u2019t have to ask. Once up to the room, the bright, modern d\u00e9cor followed from the lobby. Unfortunately then we started to find some problems: light fixtures had blown out bulbs in them, yes there are multiple Tv\u2019s in every room but remotes were missing batteries, the whirlpool tub jets did not work, and on the slide door from the bedroom to the bath the lock was missing. Later tried to call housekeeping several times, for an extra blanket, and no one even answered, had to call the front desk still took atleast 5 mins to answer then when we asked if someone could send up another blanket they said \u201cwe\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d No blanket arrived that night or the next night when we called again. The pool service was awful, we had a cabana w/ bottle service the one day and then a circle bed with table and bottle service the other day, both times it took about a \u00bd hr to get the 2 bottles and mixers. They try and make it seem as if all the cabanas and beds are taken by putting reserved signs on them, but for those two days we were the only people there in a cabana and the other day there might have a been another 2 couples on the beds. There just are not enough pool servers for you to get your drink in a reasonable time. If you wanted a drink you were better off just walking up to the bar yourself because it took half the time.

The black carpet did not appear to be vacuumed and after showering, we found the tub drain was clogged. We notified the front desk, who arranged to have the suite vacuumed, the bathtub cleaned and the clogged drained cleared. However, the ceiling vents were never addressed so the dust in this room remained problematic for our allergies. In fairness, we didn't have the same housekeeper each day so some cleaners were better than others, Still there should be a standard all cleaners follow. In the early morning the day after we raised our concerns, we were awakened at 4:15 am by a housekeeper talking on her portable radio while vacuuming the vacant adjoining room. Shortly after she left the suite, two maintenance personnel entered the adjoining suite and began hammering and drilling what they claimed was a broken door knob. When asked why they were there so early, one replied, 'This is a 24 hour operation. If you don't like it, you can make a complaint at the front desk.' Two enquiries at the front desk with first Kelly and then Liz resulted in a static comment, 'We are a 24 hour operation. The room has to be cleaned for the weekend.' For the record, the day in question was a Wednesday. We were there one week and at no other time did we see or hear the housecleaners before 7:30-8:00 am. We are seasoned travellers. We don't think it is too much to expect to have your room clean when you arrive and maintained throughout your stay. You shouldn't have to go looking for toilet paper or tissue. The workout room was another matter. It smelled like sewage. Beyond that, there was no water, no mats, no exercise ball, no exercise posters, bare walls and limited exercise equipment. Here again, there was no evidence of the room or the equipment being cleaned. So, although Westgate is billed as a luxury hotel, we would rate it much more moderately. The size of the room and the view were the savings grace. If you decide to stay here, don't expect a newspaper or bottled water or a fridge stocked for your convenience.

What's even better is that they have two ABC stores located in the mall that are almost like mini-Walmarts. Big bonus with that is they sell beer and alcohol there that is much cheaper than constantly buying drinks from the bars. Pre-flight baby. That's my motto. Checking in took over twenty minutes. Got to my room and was initially impressed with the style and decor of the room. More like a small apartment since it had a full sized kitchen with very modern appliances. Fully stocked with pots, pans, plates, cups, and silverware. A tv in every room including the bathroom. Then I started to unpack and that's when I noticed some things. Bathroom counter was dirty in the corners with dirt and hair. The floor was clean in the middle but not under the cabinet area. The toilet was clean under the lid and the seat. There was some kind of crusty stuff behind the lid when you put the lid down and on the bowl area. There was the same crusty stuff in streaming lines down the front of the toilet bowl down to the floor. I'm not sure what the heck it was but I then started to clean my own room starting in the bathroom, bedroom to include the jacuzzi, living room, and finally the kitchen which was the cleanest of all the rooms. I never realized that for paying $200+ dollars a night for a room there that I would be given the bonus enjoyment of spending the first hour in the room cleaning it. The hotel overall is nice. Would I stay there again? Yes. But the next time I'd either contact the front desk or just bring my own cleaning supplies and ask for a discount for doing my own cleaning. I forgot to mention that the glass coffee table hadn't been dusted in a very long time. Not the glass on top but the surface six inches underneath and fully open to being cleaned.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the woman who was supposed to be our \"host\" for the week. Our greeting was barely a smile from all we encountered. We were never given the \"welcome pkg\" that other guests were toting around. When we received it after 3 days, it was instructions on how to operate the washing machine and a booklet that I could have picked up in the mall at any kiosk. We were given a room overlooking the parking lot and told that a \"strip view\" (that we were promised \"upon availability\", but was apparently not even an option), was solely available only if you \"bought\" the 4 BR unit. The \"host\" left us waiting in our room for an hour to go downstairs to \"search for a room for us with a better view\". Finally, I called HER and she had no idea that she even left us hanging. After 24 hours, they offered to switch us to a lower floor view of the airport. Our host said to us, \"Well, you ONLY paid $999 for the week\". I politely explained to her that my husband and I don't rob banks for a living and worked very hard to save the money for this vacation that we had made plans for a year and a half prior. We very unhappily stayed in our original room. We were shocked that there was NO DAILY MAID SERVICE. We were told somebody would clean the room on DAY 4, because we were OWNERS. (We purchased a 7 night time share, and I would hardly consider us \"owners\"). Why did others get it and we did not? Day 4 arrived, and the only thing they did was make the bed and smear up the bathroom counter. The dust was still the same dust (and then some) as the day we got there. We had to request more towels. One afternoon I called for toilet paper. When we had returned at 11pm, still no toilet paper. Repeatedly, they referred to PH Towers as \"a resort\" and not a \"hotel\", and this is what they do at \"resorts\". Ridiculous. I travel quite extensively throughout the world. There is always the option to check out the evening before. When I saw this on the TV at 2am, I decided to \"check out\", since we had to check out by 10am. My TV shut immediately shut off, and when I called downstairs, I was asked if I were leaving my room right now (2am?) and that I am offically \"checked out\". It took 45 minutes to get my TV service re-established. The front desk person was not very nice. Ridiculous. My husband and I are still trying to figure out how on earth they could ask us for $110,000 for a one week time share stay at this hotel. The supposed glitz and glamour of this hotel is out-weighed by its sub-standard, very disappointing service. Seems to me that the clientel is geared to people that have never traveled before and do not know a good hotel from a not-so-good one. Do not be misled by the \"cool stuff\" like the washer-dryer, the full kitchen, and the projection tv...How many times are you really going to use this stuff? I would have preferred they spend their money on better customer service instead of useless amenities. At the time share \"presentation part 2\", we were told that there are not even any units available at PH Towers, Las Vegas, and that the only thing they could offer us to purchase was in Orlando. Just what 2 retirees need...7 nights at $110,000 to see Mickey. On a good note...the bed was very comfortable. Needless to say, we will be staying elsewhere on our return to Las Vegas.

Hotel is very nice and modern, easy to get to the strip (either through the mall or just walk up the road, really it is not all that far) and pool area is lovely. We did have a few issues though, so this hotel might not be for those wanting to get some sleep! 99% of the rooms in this hotel are adjoining so whilst the walls seem to be well soundproofed, unfortunately you can hear exactly what is going on next door as the noise filters through the adjoining door. We arrived on the sunday late afternoon after a long 11 hour flight so was in need of a good sleep that evening. Forced ourselves to go get some food and came back to the room next door having a party. They soon went out and we thought that was the end of that. Unfortunately, they came back around 3am with extra people to carry on their party! Security was called who told them to keep the noise down which to our relief they did. During the week it was a bit more quiet, beware the 24 hour maid service as some of them like to put on music whilst making up rooms and we could hear every conversation through their radio. Took 3 calls down to security before they realised what was going on (they kept telling us the room was vacant). We got $100 dollars for food for our troubles, but we changed this for a late check out and this came in very handy. On the Friday the hotel was taken over by young americans who are in the mood to party (also seems every male believes he is a gangster so you get a load of attitude from them). The people next door started their party around 4pm with drinking games, but went out leaving their music blaring! Security had to go in and turn it off. After not sleeping most of the week we couldnt take any more and asked to be moved. It is worth bearing in mind that if security get 3 complaints about noise the people will be evicted, which is a good system however we didnt have the energy to put up with any more, making phone calls and waiting for security to make the long trips up to the room. We moved down 3 floors which was a bit better and managed to get sleep for the remaining 2 nights (was there 7 nights in all). We found the hotel staff really pleasant and helping. They understood about the noise as they do receive complaints from those who live at the hotel (timeshare) and we were really pleased with how efficient they were. As mentioned before, the pool area is lovely, although the pool bar is a little on the expensive side for a small can of beer. You can take in your own water, but not alcohol or food. Also, the pool opens at 9am and shuts at 6pm. The hotel do close the pool if they dont think the weather is right which was annoying as sometimes it would have been nice to sit outside for some fresh air instead of the air con. By going outside it didnt mean we were going to get in the pool but the staff wont let anyone outside even to use the jaccuzzi/hot tub. The rooms were lovely, big comfortable beds but the showers were not all the powerful. Seemed to take forever to wash out shampoo. The baths are jacuzzi but make sure the water is filled way above the jets before turning it on! Lol. Floor to ceiling windows, big tv's so would have made a very lovely stay if not the for noise. Free safe too which is a bonus! Get a fridge, miscrowave, coffee machine, toaster, plates, glasses, cutlery and dishwasher so we had breakfast in our room every morning which was nice.

However upon arrival there was 2 desk agents behind the counter so checkin took an ENTIRE HOUR!...all i wanted to do was get in our room change and get back down to the casinos...that wasnt happening very quickly. When arriving to the room we were very surprised of the 2 bedroom suite we booked. Very big and inviting. The LONG walk from the hotel to the actual strip was pretty annoying, but after we got the hang of it it was not so bad. The gigantic MOTHS in our guestroom after a night out was not what we expected when returning to our room after a late night out. When I called down to the front desk i was transferred about 8 times until I finally got someone who offered breakfast for us in the AM and to have someone from HSKP to come up.....Very nice I thought, but when the HSKP never came my frustration level continued. For the remainder of my evening my girlfriends and I spent our time killing bugs....GREAT VACA RIGHT!...Next morning we woke up very early to walk around and really absorb all of Vegas..upon returning to our room once again probably about 6pm to get ready for the evening we walk into an UNMADE ROOM...no beds made, no towels replenishe, and just an overall disgrace of service. We called down yet again to have someone come up. Fed up at this point that while I am trying to get ready I have a HSKP walking around trying to clean which should have been done hours ago.....Pretty much how the rest of the weekend continued....After all of this we received a COMP night back good for a year... - YEAR later arrives and I think lets try this place again with the BF..maybe it was opening year and they just went through some issues....My issues started at bookings. It took about 20 emails and 5 calls to the west coast to actually finalize this booking. The person I was speaking to would never return my emails or calls and at one point it was an absolute joke...After almost a month of trying to book a 2 night stay I finally got everything in order. Upon arrival at 12MIDNIGHT to las vegas checking in was once again another joke....The desk person DID NOT HAVE A ROOM FOR ME...he had my booking just did not have a room immediately available...R U KIDDING...it is midnight and i have flown all night and this is what I walk into. About 30 min later is when I finally got my room...(there was notes on my reservation for having an bad stay prior, but you think they gave a crap...NOPE) About 5 min into the room we receive a call from the desk person saying the manager would like to see me if I had a chance to welcome me...I though ok let them redeem themselves....So as I walked down to the lobby again to head to the casino i waited at the front desk for about another 30min until the manager came out....she shook my hand and said how may I help you?????? WHAT!!!!!! You called me here....the manager basically had no idea why i was there...yet again terrible service.... I have written so much I wont bore you anymore, but the checkout was even more horrific on this stay.....

The V Theater, which hosts many shows, is only a 2-3 minute walk. Very close, easy access to City Center, Paris and Bellagio.

Our room (which can be booked separately as a king hotel room, or as a second bedroom to the suite) included a small kitchenette with microwave, mini frig, coffemaker, blender, dishes, plus a comfortable sofa, desk and chair. Housekeeping was lacking. Maybe just because this was a time share, I dunno. But we had no housekeeping service for the first 3 days. Ran out of toilet paper, coffee packets, soap, etc, and our trash was beginning to overflow. On the fourth day, our room was made up . Sheets were not changed, just made up. Used towels were replaced. The carpet was not vacuumed. A malfunctioning lamp, which we reported, was not fixed during our stay. The deadbolt on our door was broken. The closet door didn't slide properly and emitted a horrendous screech every time we opened or closed it. We were disappointed to experience these problems in a fairly new property.

The girls could shut their door and have privacy when they needed it and we could all hang out in the living room and kitchen together when we wanted to do that.

The rooms were clean when we got there and were kept clean by the maids throughout the stay. We were happy enough with the rooms for what we paid for.\u00a0 The front desk wasn't a great help, rarely saw anyone at the concierge desk if you needed anything.

Taxis by the way are extortionate in Las Vegas, especially in the evenings\u00a0 The location was very good, no more than $15.00 from the airport including tip which in moderate traffic is about 10-15min drive. Our top tips: 1. Take the express bus located right in front of the Paris/Bellagio to take you up and down the strip. It's final destination is at the cloths outlets on either end, this is the best way to travel on a budget. 2. Enjoy the Bellagio fountains over a meal in KOI Japanese restaurant, access through the casino in PH. You can request the seats if you get there early or make reservations. 3. $1 blackjack and roulette only in the Sahara, expect to pay minimum $5 anywhere else on the strip. 4. You can get free shows if you are approached by the timeshare guys in PH miracle mile shopping center. You can bargain for the shows you want, really push them, and all you have to do is spend 90mins viewing a couple of there properties. Handy if you're on a budget... 5. There's free wifi in the restaurant Ocean One located in the miracle mile shops. There isn't free wifi in the towers but the price isn't too bad, \u00a0just remember to only use one device or you'll be charged for any extra that you hookup.\u00a0 We had great weather on the strip until the last couple of days when it got really windy and cold but no rain. We flew to the south rim for the day which was absolutely bitter cold but beautiful and enjoyed fantastic weather at the hoover dam on another day.\u00a0 We would recommend it for it's value but overall it's not the best quality inside, certain elements brought the place down but because it's all so new, it can get away with it but I'd say that the rooms are not going to age very well!

But I got a great deal on a one bedroom and for the price I could not pass it up. And it turned out to be a great decision. Got to the hotel a few hours early and they happily checked us into our hotel room early.. there was no wait to check in and for only $10/night they upgraded us to an upper floor and we had a great view. The room was amazing and especially for three young guys it was an awesome room to have a party in because of the full kitchen. Our kitchen was fully stocked with dishes and utensils and even a blender. The room was very clean and the bathroom was huge and included a washer/dryer which came in handy. The living room had a very comfortable large couch that was also a fold out bed. I know some of the reviews said they didnt clean the rooms but ours was cleaned every day of our trip. Also we called down to the front desk a few times for extra things and they were so helpful and nice and responded very fast. The room is quite amazing and has huge speakers and curtains that are automatic. There are tvs everywhere and I think we counted 5 total in our room. We had a view of the strip and at night it was amazing. We loved the location of the hotel because it conncects to the miracle mile shops and is right in the middle of the strip which is convenient. The beds were very comfortable even the fold out one in the couch. We had three guys in a one bedroom and there was plenty of room. The bathroom had a huge granite stone shower and seperate area for the toilet. The room had mirrors everywhere which was very helpful when your trying to get ready. Parking was very close, just park on the 3rd level as that connects you right into the hotel. Overall our experiece was one of the best I have ever had in Vegas and will definately stay at this hotel again especially for the price.

On our previous stay in Las Vegas, we were suckered into attending a Westgate Resorts Timeshare presentation and actually enjoyed it. . . we bought a Vacation Traveler Package which is basically a trial run to see if you'd like a time share. We thought it would be fun to stay in this hotel with our timeshare since it is brand new. Because of this, we were treated like owners, which I think is where you get treated better. We were allowed to check into our 1 bedroom suite about 3 hours early, which was great. First impressions of the room were great. It was very modern with many amenities that were excellent and that we didn't expect. The blinds are all automatic and the living room window converts to a movie screen with projector. . .it would have been even better if there was a DVD player hooked up to it. . . The kitchen was fully stocked with all the dishes we would need. The bed was great and the jacuzzi tub was awesome. Because it's a time share, housekeeping doesn't come everyday, at least that's what we were told, the truth is, we were there for 3 nights and housekeeping didn't come at all. Our garbages were overflowing and we ran out of clean towels. The suite had a washer/dryer machine in it which we used but it really didn't work very well and none of our clothes would dry properly. There is a large block of elevators that are super fast. We were on the 34th floor so we took the first set of elevators. They were actually very scary. For a brand new hotel, the elevators made all sorts of creaking and weird noises that made you think it was going to plummet at any given moment. They also went so fast and stopped so fast that it felt like you were going to vommit nearly every time. . . not so nice. By the end of our trip we were just grateful that we wouldn't have to ride those elevators again. We were told that, because of the vacation package we were on, we'd have to meet quickly to sign a paper saying if we wanted to buy a timeshare or not. They said it would be a quick \"yes or no\" answer. Up to this meeting, they treated us like royalty but we were in no position to actually buy a timeshare. We went to this meeting where they repeatedly pressured us for about an hour and a half until we nearly stormed out of the room. The timeshare price went from over $100K down to $6K. Pretty funny! They even got rude with us after a while. . . I don't even know how many times I actually said no in that meeting. . .it was a lot. So after wasting a bunch of our time we finally got out of there. They stopped treating us like royalty and our view of the hotel changed at that point. We realized that it really wasn't for us. It was nice that it was non smoking and non gaming. The location, connected to the miracle mile shops, was also really convenient. The hotel room was way too big for 2 people to stay in. It would have been better suited to a group of people. We spent most of our time in the bedroom part (which is actually the size of a normal hotel room). I would recommend this hotel to groups of people who need lots of space. If you were going to party in your room, then this would be great since there was a fridge, sink, cups, etc. We won't stay here again.

We were asked EVERY time we walked through the lobby (no way around it) if we were staying there by employees attempting to sell time shares. It made us uncomfortable, but we ignored them and kept walking every time. The bed didn't have a comforter, so until I noticed the blanket in the closet, I froze. Also, the bed was so hard that we slept terribly the entire vacation. The good points...LOCATION! LOCATION! LOCATION! Mid-strip is the best! You do have to walk through the Miracle Mile, but it's short and totally worth it. In fact, we enjoyed walking through it each day to the strip, casino or restaurants. It was nice to be so close to an ABC store, too! Our room was modern, fun and had amazing views! We were facing the north side of the strip and had a partial view of the Bellagio fountains. We had booked the studio suite thinking it was just one room, but it wasn't. We had a living room with a couch, large tv, closet and kitchen. In the bedroom we had a king size bed, large tv, hot tub, mirrored closet doors (helpful!) and large bathroom. The shower was a stall, but beautiful with glass tiles all around and a wonderful rainfall showerhead. There were two doors to the bathroom accessed from the living room and bedroom. The roll down window shades were great blackout curtains and I loved that they were set to a control on the wall. We loved the Planet Hollywood Casino. The ambiance, the people, the machines, the staff, etc. were great! As for food, I would absolutely recommend Earl of Sandwich. Our favorite new fast and easy restaurant in Vegas. Planet Dailies was ok, but I wouldn't recommend it. Our favorite slushy is in the Miracle Mile at the taco place and they'll refill ANY cup. Try the Moonshine.

Driving in to Las Vegas at night is exciting with all the lights coming at you. We left our car with the valet in the garage and headed to the check-in. This went smoothly and we were advised as to how the Towers worked. The room is initially clean and it will not be cleaned again for 4 days but if you need anything, like more towels, just let housekeeping know. Our suite was at the end of a very long hallway on the 35th floor. The 2 bedroom suite has 2 other rooms that adjoined to it. Opening these rooms made the suite a total of 4 bedrooms. One was a standard room with a pull out couch and the other adjoining room was a one bedroom studio which had a sitting room with it. All in all we had plenty of space for 8 people. The main room in the suite was decorated. Red, white and black with a Marilyn Monroe motif, which included floor to ceiling windows, a projector and screen for your viewing pleasure with a fully appointed kitchenette. The long sofa in the room was red leather. Not quite my taste, but as my family kept reminding me, \u2018this is Las Vegas, and everything is over the top\u2019. We were told during out trip that we had over 2,500 square feet of space with all the rooms we had attached. I will admit, we were not climbing over each other with 4 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms. But that\u2019s where the fun ended. The room was dirty and dusty. I believe nobody had stayed in these rooms for weeks. The automatic shades in one room were not working. It actually took engineering to have to come to take the device apart to get it to work. You don\u2019t want the early morning light coming into your floor to ceiling windows in the morning. The night we checked in we had 3 maintenance people in the room. Housekeeping needed to come to supply soap, towels, sheets for the pull-out sofas and toilet paper. Slow drains and standing water in sinks needed cleaning. Dust was everywhere and it appears that the last people who stayed in the room were part of a golf tournament, evidenced by the 2 golf balls that were under chairs when we got there and remained there upon our departure. We were promised that housekeeping would come and clean but they never did. Other than the room itself, the hotel was a fun place to stay. It was connected to the Miracle Mile Shops and the Casino and we barely spent much time in the room. The Concierge was helpful and there were plenty of places to eat.

When I went here I had a great stay. I will start with us first off having a terrible travel time with Allegiant Air and a whole gong show of mechanical issues with the plane having to be redirected and having to return to GFK and losing a day. However it got better. Once we arrived at PH Towers at the downstairs valet to the hotel sure enough there were the prostitutes there, but not a one of them said a word or annoyed us our entire stay. It seems security might have been around a bit more as my girlfriend was asked at one point to show her keycard to security to verify she was staying there which is a plus since it meant they were cleaning it up a bit. Anyways, where was I. When we got to the desk we explained our joyful begining of the trip to our deskman and he gladly upgraded us free of charge to the 56th floor 1 bedroom suite vs the regular room we were otherwise getting. The view was quite nice and we got to see half the bellagio fountains which was better than the alternative which would have been overlooking the parking lot and been a terrible view. While we were there housekeeping asked us a couple times if we wanted more towels and what not but we declined and were content simply having it uncleaned for the 4 days we were staying there. As for cleanliness the rooms were clean and we had no issues, but for a single day there was an odd odor almost like a mildly backed up toilet. Not entirely sure what the hell it was, but the smell was gone the next day. Also in addition to this one night while we were trying to get back up to our room on the last night we stayed the hotel elevators stopped working for whatever reason for about 10 minutes. Not sure what happened but we were able to catch it from the 2nd floor (3rd on the elevator listing, banquet/convention floor) Other than those two little issues I would say it was a great stay and because of it and its perfect location would very likely stay again.

It was literally a 2 to 3 minute walk and they have everything there and the prices are reasonable (750 ml Sky Vodka for $19.99, pretty good).

It was a notch below our skylofts experience for a much smaller price tag. we hd 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms a large lounge with projector, full kitchen, dining room a laundry in the main bathroom (took us a while to find it). we found it to be a great size for two couples. There were only a few down sides but bthey were only minute. The first was the scary lifts as mentioned in prior reviews, none of us ever had a problem with the lifts but they did sound scary and were often out of order \u2013 our first time in the lift the alarm was going!!! The second was a loose cable on the back of the sound system in the room, meaning sound would cut in an out at times, although alot of the time we just used the tvs in our own rooms anyway. The timeshare people are at the information desk \u2013 they tried to collar us with the promise of free show tickets but we knew it was timeshare presentation so we just said no thankyou and we had no other problems.

Incredible views, great beds, tons of space, great showers and tubs...and the 8+ foot HDTV was incredible for wildcard weekend. You can't beat the location on the strip and it's a short walk from your suite to the Miracle Mile shops or the PH Casino (which is highly under-rated and one of the most fun casinos around).

Was apprehensive based on other reviews, but check in was smooth, the room was mostly in good order and the hallways were not as dirty as others have found. The elevator area is like a wind-tunnel and a friend on 50th floor had to put towels under door to keep lamp shades from swaying in draft. Very spacious room and bathroom, including a huge couch and coffee table, and a Jacuzzi whirlpool tub in the bathroom. Toiletries included shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and lotion plus shower cap (thanks to the management for not making me call downstairs to ask for one). Liked this place because it is quiet/no casino and totally non-smoking! If you want to be in the action, it's a short walk through the attached mall to attached Planet Hollywood Casino. I would definitely consider staying here again on a future trip because of location -now a short walk across street bridge to new Cosmopolitan Hotel and City Center complex and the non-smoking/low key atmosphere. The pool looked nice, but was closed for winter/too cold anyway unless you are a member of the Polar Bear Club. The info desk in lobby had helpful staffers that provided maps of Strip area, shopping options in the adjacent mall as well as nearby to hunt down some items I needed. Wireless access could be purchased for $19.95 for 3 days, a better deal than by the day, but still a rip off considering that many hotels provide it free. No resort fee charged since room rates were jacked up (3X to 4X the usual rate) for CES. Room had a microwave, Fridge and dishwasher, plus dishes for two people which was great to make breakfast in the morning. Skipped the overpriced hotel gift mini//mart and went to the ABC store in attached Planet Hollywood Miracle Mile shops for bargains - fresh pineapple, hard boiled eggs, cereal and sodas/water to provision the room for 3 days at CES. The housekeepers must not read English because I left several notes asking for feather pillows (the foam pillows in room were plentiful but very hard/uncomfortable), and the lamp was broken/always on and unable to turn it off or unplug it due to broken switch and plug being behind a built in cabinet. Pulled out bulb and then had to drape towels and my coat around lamp base (also illuminated) to darken the room. On Day Two of stay asked front desk to send engineering to fix it, and upon return the lamp was at last turned off. Great blackout shades are electric, but hard to adjust if you want some light in the room. My minor issues with this hotel: the hallways were somewhat shop-worn with dings/dents and scrapes to door ways and hall areas that could easily be fixed. There was a bit of trash/litter left that stayed on 23rd floor most of the day...guess nobody checks. I did hear adjoining room guests coming in late in the hall, but loud drunks are loud drinks. Also heard water running in adjacent rooms and a shouting match from upstairs guests that could be heard in the bathroom. Didn't need earplugs to sleep with the heat fan on high. It is a 15 minute hoof to the nearest monorail stop at Ballys Casino. Monorail is for tourists only and not much use during large events because it is too small, holds few people, and requires a schlep to the bowels of casino hotels to get on/off. Did use it to go to Convention Center on two days and lines were long, not enough machines to buy tickets. Due to long taxi lines and quirky entrances/exits for cars in and out of casinos, suggest wearing comfortable shoes and walking the strip if you have a trip of 15 - 20 minutes which was faster than waiting in cab lines and then shelling out $15 to go a few blocks.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "arizona", "Title": "\u201cWill be returning..\u201d", "Author": "texaschick87", "ReviewID": "UR92244870", "Content": "Our stay was 23 Dec-26 Dec.

It's our little getaway. We look around at the various resort/casinos to compare prices and availability before we book - we don't just dive right in. Since we were bringing 2 friends with us we decided to book the penthouse suite - but when we called to book we were told that if we booked the 2 bedroom suite instead, when we arrived we could \"upgrade\" to the penthouse for only $50 more per night (cheaper than if we booked the penthouse that moment). We were assured that there would be a penthouse available - seriously, I asked the woman at least half a dozen times if she was SURE there would be a penthouse available. She said there would be, \"without a doubt\" - verbatim. Awesome! (we thought). When we arrived we were very impressed. The check-in lobby area was beautiful. So beautiful that I didn't mind waiting 15 minutes in line to check in. When it was our turn we went through the usual check-in stuff and told the clerk we'd like to upgrade to the penthouse. After clicking around on his computer for a bit the clerk told us there weren't any available. \"You've got to be kidding\" - my words, verbatim. After double and tripple checking we gave up and the clerk assured us that our 2 bedroom suite was still very nice, still very roomy, and that we'd be satisfied with it. We weren't - and because I'd be here all night if I wrote about each way we were not satisfied in detail, I'll just list them here: - The 2 bedroom suite is not actually a 2 bedroom suite. It is a 1 bedroom suite that is linked to a basic studio suite. - The master bath is a shared bath (1 door in the master bedroom, 1 door in the living area). - \"all day\" room service is not actually 24 hour room service. Yeah, I don't get it either. It doesn't list their hours on the menu but we called at 11pm to order a late dinner and we were told they were closed. - The wireless internet is not free (which is okay, I guess) but you have to pay $9 per DAY for EACH DEVICE that connects to it! In our case: 4 smart-phones + 3 laptop computers = nearly $70 per day. We assumed it was just $9 per day for unlimited devices because we have had to do it that way in several hotels...but not at this place, and at check-out time, BOY were we surprised. - The walls are paper-thin. Especially in the bathrooms where the acoustics are better. I could hear people talking (very clearly!) the entire time we were there. - We were kept awake by the click-clack-click-clacking of people walking in the room above us. We were on the 22nd floor but it sounded like these people were walking on tile...not carpet. It was that loud. - The beds are covered with 2 sheets and 1 thin blanket, even in the winter when it's freezing! And don't bother calling down to get another blanket at night because no one will answer the phone. We called 3 different times between the hours of 12 and 4am. Ring...ring...ring...nothing. - Although we were told we'd have a great view, our view was of the parking garage. 22 floors up...but still of the parking garage. - Watching TV while winding down at night was very frustrating. Click any button on the remote and only 4 or 5 seconds later will it actually register on the TV. - the silverware in the kitchen was dirty. - the washer/dryer combo in the master bath wouldn't open. The door was locked and it wouldn't budge. We're a very technologically inclined group but even this was beyond us. Tried calling down to the front desk to get maintenance up to fix it...and guess what? Ring...ring...ring...nothing.

On arriving at the front entrance we were greeted by two attendants who asked if we wanted our bags checking but we declined and said we would take our own. They directed us to the escalator/lift and said we needed the first floor. We arrived at an empty check in desk and were greeted straight away by a lovely smiley lady called Deborah. She checked us in within about 5 minutes and we were off to our room. We had booked a one bedroom suite and she offered us an upgrade to a high floor with a view for an extra $10 per night. We accepted and were given room 5317 on the 53rd floor. There were 6 lifts but only 4 of them went to the high floors. There was never a wait for the lift and we always managed to get from the lobby to our room within about 2 minutes. Our room was fabulous. A sitting room/dining room/kitchenette with a separate bedroom and separate shower room. The view was great too. Not a full strip view but we could see the Eiffel Tower and part of the fountains at Bellagio to our left. Straight ahead we could see the Strip skyscape and to the right we could see over to the mountains and the city. The bed was huge and super comfortable. We had a Jacuzzi bath in the bedroom which hubby used once. The kitchen featured a slim line dishwasher, one cup coffee percolator, fridge freezer with ice maker and water dispenser and a microwave. The bathroom featured a full size washer/dryer which we used several times. There were TVs everywhere and telephones in the bedroom, lounge and toilet. In terms of amenities, we received a small bottle of washing up liquid, a couple of dishwasher tablets, two packs of coffee and a pan scrub in the kitchen. In the bathroom we got a small box of washing powder, hand soap, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion and a shower cap. Apart from the coffee, the amenities were not replenished or replaced for our whole stay but that was of no consequence to us as we had taken our own. We were NEVER approached by timeshare people in the week we stayed and always found the staff to be courteous, polite and helpful. We needed to get a new room key and the young man who dealt with us was just lovely. On checking out we were asked if we had enjoyed our stay and if we would be returning. I once asked the cleaning staff if we could have a couple of extra sachets of coffee and he obliged with a smile. We had room service one morning for breakfast and it arrived exactly when we were told to expect it. It was good and wasn\u2019t outrageously expensive either. We didn\u2019t find the walk to the casino to be too far. We could be out of our room and on the casino floor in 5 minutes. If we wanted to get onto the Strip we could get out through a side door onto Harmon and again be at the Strip in 5 minutes. As for the facilities at the hotel, we ate in Planet Dailies on the casino floor one night and enjoyed our meal, we had breakfast one morning at the Pampas Brazilian restaurant and we also bought late night sandwiches from Earl of Sandwich. We found the slots to be pretty tight at Planet Hollywood and the cocktail service wasn\u2019t the best, particularly on Veterans\u2019 Weekend when the place was absolutely packed to the rafters. That didn\u2019t bother us too much as we did most of our gambling at other hotels. You really could stay at Planet Hollywood or the Towers and never leave the hotel if you didn\u2019t want to though. Now, if I had to complain about any aspect of my stay it would be on the housekeeping side. I should mention first of all that all the surfaces in the rooms are made of black granite which is notoriously difficult to keep clean. I am not sure what we were entitled to expect from housekeeping but every day the beds were made with clean linen, the towels were replaced and the wash basins in the bathroom were wiped out. On two days the maid filled the dishwasher with some glasses that we had left on the counter and on the other days they were left for us to wash up ourselves. Apart from this I don\u2019t really know what else was done because as the week wore on the room became more and more dusty and the bathroom floor in particular didn\u2019t appear to have been swept because there was a build up of hairs on the tiles by the end of the week. The floor to ceiling windows had handprints on them all week from before we arrived. The counter tops in the bathroom never seemed to be wiped down because my cosmetics and personal items were always in exactly the same place I left them and there were still water stains on the granite. However, unlike some previous reviews, we always found the corridors, elevators and common areas to be spotless and we never witnessed plates or any other items left in the hallways. On another note, we rented a car for the week and had heard bad reports about the valet getting full very quickly so we always self parked. This was sometimes problematic as the car park got very full and we never managed to park on a lower level than 5 which involved a walk up and downstairs to the hotel. If convenient parking is important to you then I wouldn\u2019t recommend staying here. I would stay at PH Towers again if I was looking for a good sized suite in a good location. The housekeeping thing was a minor irritation but certainly wouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker if I was choosing hotels.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Willits, California", "Title": "\u201cBachelor Party!!!\u201d", "Author": "SkiBum95490", "ReviewID": "UR87636868", "Content": "We stayed at PH Towers November 5th to the 9th for a bachelor party.

I read the many reviews of this resort before staying this weekend and encountered a few of the similar problems. I'll get to the problems in a minute. I want to address the concern many had about the walk to the strip. First of all, puuulllleaze!!! If you have special needs, this concern is understandable, but people, Las Vegas involves walking if you wean to get around and see the different casinos and attrctions that it offers. It takes less than 10 minutes that it takes to get to the strip, if you are out of breathe after that, then hire a driver to see the city. Now to the problems: We left our room in the morning 7:30am, flipped on the \"make up room\" switch and the maid showed up while we were back in the room at 5pm to clean it. Not cool. I am no neat freak either, but c'mon, you had all day to clean the room! Second, I went to make myself some coffee in the coffee maker and there was a dirty filter in it...yuk! Third, I opened the cabinet to see the dishes and there was sugar or some substance all over the plates. We let the bald African American gentleman at the front desk know about these issues, and he had a real nonchalant and unprofessional attitude with us. Left a sour taste in my mouth, as I work in a hotel and had someone brought these issues to my attention I would have been very embarrassed, apoligetic, and would have compted something to make up for it. Would I stay here again? Yeah I would, but I hope they hire those with a professional demeanor at the front desk and replace the ones that are lacking.", "Date": "November 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Regina, Saskatchwan, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel in Vegas!\u201d", "Author": "CanadianMystique", "ReviewID": "UR86316546", "Content": "PH Towers is the best!

In both of the rooms we stayed in one complete wall was glass- nice views of the other hotels. The blinds could be drawn and provided total darkness in the room- we slept great! The beds are very comfy and plush. We had stayed at Planet Hollywood twice before and loved the location which is why we decided to to try PH Towers, which is also connected to Miracle Mile Shops. It is very convenient as there is lots of good shopping right there and a nice selection of restaurants in the Mall. We pretty much love everything about both PH and PH Towers- super modern and great location! Being right in the middle of the Strip is great- you can easily walk to either end. The one other bonus to PH Towers is that there is no Casino there you can just walk out the door to catch a cab or through the lobby to Miracle Mile- no huge smokey Casino to get lost in!

We loved the big window and automatic blinds, the artwork and the red sofa. There was an excellent gym in the complex and a pool which looked great but we didn't use. The only gripes we had were that we never got our promised daily newspaper and water and there were glasses and plates on the floor in the hallway that weren't picked up for our entire stay. This made it a bit annoying when we were hit with a $15/night service charge at departure. The location is great. You do walk through a long shopping centre to get anywhere, but we enjoyed that and of course ended up buying a few things along the way. PH also had a car hire outlet attached which was very convenient since we were off to drive through the desert to Palm Springs for the next leg of our holiday. Tips for the area: Bill's Gambling Hall and Saloon, down the street a bit, is the best! $5 blackjack tables with great drinks service and entertainment featuring Big Elvis.

The room itself was comfortable and clean. There was even a pullout couch, so it really could accommodate 2 couples all together (though that would be tight) or at least an additional person. The views are very nice, even if you \u2013 as was the case with us \u2013 are not on the Paris side. The floor-to-ceiling windows really make any view appealing. The building and adjacent area with all of the Miracle Mile Shops and restaurants was really wonderful. It is possible to stay here, go out every day, and not even leave Planet Hollywood -- not that I would recommend it. But really, there is a ton to do. Also, things in Vegas seem close to one another but they are not. It is tempting to stay in the self-contained PH Westgate Towers environment, but please get out there and see some of the strip. The lounge areas downstairs were comfortable and had a sleek design. We did not try the bar, but there is a happy hour with two-for-one drinks. The pool was very nice and always clean. The one thing we noticed was that by midday, half of the pool was in the shade. So choose your chair wisely. Cabanas are also available but for some ridiculous price of either two or three hundred dollars. No thanks. We booked our room via a friend who traded his timeshare for this room. We didn\u2019t realize that we would be in for a sales pitch. That was the one thing that kind of annoyed us. I understand they want to make a sale, but they were relentless. From the moment we checked in \u2013 seriously, we hadn\u2019t even put our bags down \u2013 a representative was at the door to welcome us/schedule a \u201csurvey\u201d meeting (aka the sales pitch.)

Here we were excited to be in the sunshine for a week, and that was how we were welcomed. We got over it, but she kept calling. That aside, our experience staying here was mostly positive. The few negatives: Cleaning is done only every four days. That includes trash removal and restocking of essentials like toilet paper and towels! Yuck. Who wants leftover food and other garbage sitting in the small trash barrel for that long? When we requested additional towels we did get them after a pretty long wait, but the point is we got them. The kitchen area had plates, glasses, silverware, and a dishwasher. However, there was no dish detergent for either hand washing or the dishwasher itself. A very small thing but a little odd. There is $5-per-use business center downstairs where you can print boarding passes and surf the Web as my friend described it \"at the speed of dial-up AOL.\" (Or you can pay some ridiculous fee for wireless access...) A non-essential perk: I rented a car to take a side trip from Vegas and there is an Avis on-site at Planet Hollwood. This made it super convenient to get away \u2013 I didn\u2019t have to go back to the airport to pick up the rental. The positives did outweigh the negatives, and I would stay here again.

Absolutely! The Westgate towers are connected to the Miracle Mile Shops which are connected to the Planet Hollywood Casino. The towers do have their own entrance which is one flight down from the lobby via elevator or escalator. You can get a cab, limo or shuttle right there. True the Valet attendants don't come off helpful until you ask, but as soon as I did they were great. So, check in -- simple and fast with very courteous clerk, she even went to the manager twice trying to upgrade my room to their largest 2 bedroom suite. (I had booked a studio king.) I ended up with their smaller 2 bedroom suite for a modest fee. While she wrangled with the manager I listened to others check in and didn't notice any \"attitude\" coming from any of the clerks. They all seemed more then willing to help their customers. The room was great. Large living room with a sectional sofa, floor to ceiling windows, large dining and kitchen area, good sized second bedroom, master bedroom on the corner with two separate views, and a huge master bath with jacuzzi tub, separate large shower and separate water closet. Can't comment on needing extra towels ever because there must have been 10 of each size already in the vanity. The bed was comfortable and had three different styles of pillows to choose. There were tv's in each bedroom, the living room and the master bath. The living room had a 42\" plasma and a projection tv which used the window shade as the screen. If you want to watch TV in Vegas, this is the room to do it in. It also included a DVD player, never used but then again I didn't come to watch TV. I will say the channel selection isn't great but I've never stayed in a Vegas hotel with great TV channel selection. I did find it odd the bathroom TV had different channels then the rest of the TV's. Maid service was excellent. The first day I never saw the maid but she cleaned everything, emptied the trash and put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and ran it. The next morning as I left the room she down three rooms and asked if I would like service immediately, that morning she did all the above but left extra coffee and straightened my snacks and drinks left on the bar. Zero complaints about the maid service. Didn't use the pool and the weather kept it less crowded. but it looked nice. I think there are as many chairs available as can be for the area around the pool. Guess if you want a lounger on busy days you'll have to get there early. Didn't use room service, but it's available. There also was a flyer from a nearby pizza service. The kitchen is stocked with glasses, plates and silverware but that's it. No utensils, pots or pans. The refrigerator has ice and water in the door and is a full sized side by side. There wasn't an ice machine on the 51st floor, but with the ice maker in the fridge, I never ran out. I think the studio king rooms have a small dorm type fridge so staying on a floor with zero ice could be a problem. Water pressure was very good but deceptive because the shower has a 'rain' shower head which is designed to let water fall over you, not shoot at you. The jacuzzi tub was nice and like many residential style tubs, the jets don't pound you so you won't get a super massage. The walk from the towers to the strip takes ten minutes, and you are across the street from Aria and the Bellagio. The walk to the lobby of the Bellagio takes fifteen to twenty minutes. max. I thought this was a pretty good location on the strip. The only thing it was lacking was a monorail stop. All the good things said, yes of course there are some quirks. The room only had three trash cans, doors weren't hung plumb so the master bedroom door swung shut on it's own, the kitchen cabinets weren't all straight, the dishwasher wasn't secured under the counter so with the door down it would tip forward a bit, and yes the toilets are low water flush so sometimes it takes two flushes to clear them.

We called for extra towels and they sent ones up with holes all over in them, which should have been in the garbage. Once the maids did come all they do is change the towels and make the bed. They do not dust, vacuum, or wipe the bathroom down. The magazines in the room were expired. Someone must have slammed the door throughout the night at least 20 times. I went out to the pool and all of the chairs were taken and there was no place to sit. You had to pay $150 to sit in one of the gazebos. If you want to find a cab and you go though the mall, you have to wait for about 10-15 minutes. The first morning my husband took a shower and the drain was so clogged with someone else\u2019s hair the tub just filled up and hair floating everywhere. Gross! We had to call the plumber. They also charge your credit card $50 a day for incidentals and you don\u2019t get credit for it until 10 days later. There is a dishwasher in the rooms. At first I thought it was kind of neat, then I realized- Who wants to do dishes on vacation? A large bag of garbage sat in the hallway for an entire day before someone can and picked it up. Overall it was a pain to get to, nothing special, and no room service.

We had a studio on the 37th floor overlooking the airport/MGM. The view was amazing. As most have written the room was beautiful. The beds were really comfortable and decor was modern but warm. We loved the floor to ceiling windows and the motorized shade. That said..we are owners at Westgate Lakes in Orlando and traded our time for Vegas. Along with being hasseled to buy more time at PHT there wasn't any housekeeping. We were told on the 4th day, because we were westgate owners, we would get service and talked three times to the front desk and talked twice to the manager. They all said they would do something about it.....NOTHING was done. The manager was very apologetic and nice and assured us we would haveour room done. We were out of towels, there was no place to put our trash, and we had no toilet paper. Then at check out, I spoke to the front desk about how unhappy we were and he told me that because we are owners we do not get housekeeping at all for seven days and the manager didn't know what he was talking about. I asked how much would it be per day to receive it (other Westgate properties offer this option) and he said that they didn't offer it at all. So, for owners, I agree with a previous review...make sure to to get extra toilet paper, find out where to put your trash and call for towels before you run out. Unless you stay for two weeks I guess you will never see your room cleaned. Also, our refridge was broken..they did nothing about that. As far as location, I found the walk through the mall to get to the casino or the strip a little annoying. I like being able to be right in the action. Also, at the PH casino, they were charging $9.00 for a very small drink....We have stayed on the Strip before and don't remember the drinks being that expensive. All in all, we had a great time and didn't let the lack of housekeeping ruin our trip...we will probably stay there again due to the value...we only paid a fee for changing timeshare locations.

In the end I was pleasantly surprised and glad to have given it a try. There were a few hiccups but could overlook them generally in the light of other good points. 1. There were some mention of long queues at reception, but when we arrived on a Saturday afternoon, we were the only ones in line. Checked in immediately. Never noticed queue longer than 4 or 5 throughout our stay. 2. When we checked into our room there were still dirty crockery & cutlery in the dish washer. This is bad! We put in some detegent and started the machine ourselves rather than call housekeeping. 3. The bench tops in the kitchenette and the bathroom were made from black marble. From my experience this is a very hard colour/surface to keep clean. There were always watermarks on the benches even after the room has been made up. This shows the cleaning & polishing by housekeeping were below standard. 4. The black coloured toilet hides dirt and you wonder whether it has been cleaned properly. 5. As reported before, there were alot of noisy college type youngsters during the weekend, but it quieten down during the weekdays. Most likely these type of guests must have left by then. 6. We had a studio apartment with modern fittings and a Hollywood theme. The size was reasonable with a long couch, work desk & chair, HD flat TV, wardrobe, kitchenette and bathroom with a spa bath. The king size bed and pillows were very comfortable. Our room was on the 50th floor facing north. The floor to ceiling window gave us a spectacular view of the Strip day & night. We could see the Paris hotel's Eiffel tower and a bit of the Bellagio's fountain. 7. The lobby opens directly onto the Miracle Mile's shops. There's no casino to walk thru and that is definitely a plus for us. But if you need to gamble the PH casino can be accessed from the Miracle Mile with a 5 minute walk. There's a couple of ABC store amongst the shops which is good for getting drinks, food and other supplies for your apartment. 8. Being located along the centre Strip it is very near to other attractions like Bellagio and the new City Center development opposite.

I have to say it was exactly what I was looking for. The price was reasonable compared to other higher end hotels (hard rock, palms, paris, etc.) and provided a unique look that was very attractive. We took an upgrade to a one bedroom suite for $30 per night when we arrived and it was worth it. The place was very large with more room than we needed. Both rooms had floor to ceiling windows so make sure you get a room high enough up to get a view. WE kept the windows open all night to look at the strip from our bed. We didn't use the kitchen area so I can't comment on that, but there was a projector with a 100' tv (using the shade covering one of the windows) that was fantastic. The decor is as depicted on this and other sites. Very hip place to stay. As far as the walk some people have complained of - you do have a good 5 minute walk into the casino through the mall, and then another few minutes onto the strip, but it hardly ever felt like an inconvenience.

I have come to the conclusion that some people (who probably write a lot of reviews) will find something to complain about no matter what. This trip to PHT was a golf trip for 6 guys. We picked the hotel because of the suite availability and the cost. Upon check in (Wed. eve) there was only one person working the front desk. I guess I could complain about that, but a 5 minute wait is no big deal. She even put us on the 53rd floor, 3 rooms together. The room was as wonderful as all the reviews have said. So I will just leave it at that. The service was tremendous. There did seem to be two distinct maid services though. While the first 2 days the room was \"only\" made up and new towells provided, on the third days shoes were alligned in the closet and dirty clothes were placed in a plastic back for convenience. It felt like walking into home. The people working there were great, The door men remembered us and got us limos/escalades so that all 6 of us could ride together to dinners and shows (we arranged our own golf transportation). They also negotiated the fare for these rides. The hotel's location is great. Yes, there is no casino in the hotel, but you can get to Planet Hollywood casino in less than 10 minutes walking through the mall. And yes, ther hotel loby does not \"empty out onto the strip\", but you can get there the same way. And quite frankly, you will get there as fast if not faster than from other hotels' lobbies.

The room was great! The views were amazing with floor to ceiling windows throughout all of the rooms. The showers were good, we didnt have any problem with the water pressure. The beds were really comfy, and there were lots of them. The pullout couch wasn't that great so we took turns sleeping on it. There was a big living room with a big couch attatched to the kitchen that had everything we needed. They supplied us with many towels and there was maid service every day. There was buttons in each room to put the shades up or down, so the room got really dark. The pool was nice, but cold. It was really windy while we were there, and a few of us got knocked into the pool by flying chairs. One girl was bruised pretty bad, but they were quick to make it up to us. You can't bring drinks into the pool area, you have to buy everything from the pool bar. One frozen drink costs $12, so sitting around the pool all day adds up in a hurry. The pool wasnt as busy as some of the pools in Vegas, but I like it that way. That being said, I wouldn't choose this hotel for the pool, it's no MGM, but it works. There are no restaurants in the hotel, but there are some in the miracle mile shops and at planet hollywood. The walk isn't too long, no longer than 5 minutes. But it does get annoying when you have to do it 5 times a day. Especially by the end of the night in your heels. Overall this hotel is nice. The rooms are great. But I have stayed at Planet Hollywood resort and Casino, and much prefer staying closer to the action. Just taking an elevator to the strip, or to the casino, or for breakfast, is more convenient, than walking through the mall each time. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a big group, so that you can stay together. Being a group of 12 girls, have a room that we all stayed in was extremely convenient. No phoning each other, to see what we were going to do today, just wake up, talk and leave, then meet back in the room. But if you want to be in the middle of it all, this isnt the place for you, it was fairly quiet. Oh, and we used Red Carpet VIP for our big night out. They were great! There was a long line through the casino for the club we were going to and even a long VIP line, but they go us in within minutes and took us to our table where we were treated like royalty the whole night.

WOW!!! We had a fabulous time at the Planet Hollywood Towers at Westgate (PHT). We stayed in a suite which was fantastic from head to toe. The furniture and decor were all very modern and chic, with a FULL kitchen and spacious living room area with leather couches (one that pulls out into a bed). The highlight would have to be the all automated home living system that controlled the room temperature and drop down screen (to cover the floor to ceiling windows!) so that you could watch HDTV from the wide screen projector. Fabulous! The bathroom was also exceptional. There was a large walk-in shower and plenty of mirror and counter space to get ready for a night out on the strip. If hot tubes are your thing, head to the master bedroom and you'll find a large tub with jets surrounded by mirrors on two sides which was very relaxing to soak in after a long day of shopping and gambling. The views from the living area and bedroom were also great, especially at night when the strip is lit up at night! Overall, the hotel room was clean and quiet (no loud partying to disturb you.) One of the best advantages of PHT is its location -- in the heart of the Las Vegas strip, and the hotel is connected to the Miracle Mile Shops. The only downside to PHT (if I could be nit picky) is that there is no casino in this facility. The casino is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel which is connected to PHT via the Miracle Mile Shops shopping mall. But, this was actually a good thing for my friends and I because we did not want to be bothered with all of the hustle and bustle of a loud casino in the lobby of our hotel. So, if you are looking for a hotel that has the convenience of having their casino directly attached, then PHT is not the best place for you to stay. However, if you don't mind a taking a short stroll through the mall to get to Planet Hollywood hotel and casino in order to gamble, then I would still recommend staying at the PHT. The only thing that would make PHT absolutely perfect is if they offered FREE wireless internet. You had to pay $9.99 for 24 hours of access. Or you use the two computers located in the lobby (to print out airline boarding passes, etc.) for a fee (I believe they charged $5.00 for 10 minutes of internet usage.) :0( In my opinion, hotels should provide free wireless internet, but PHT hasn't caught on to this idea just yet.

We decided on a 1 bedroom suite and we were extremely glad we did. If you want the best experience, get that room or the 2 bedroom. It was exactly as pictured; full kitchen with dishes, silverware, cookware, blender, dishwasher, full fridge and freezer. there is a small combo washer/dryer in the bathroom which was VERY useful as we were there for 5 nights and that allowed us to pack lighter. the shower is one of those 'rain-style' ones which we loved. oh yeah, the jacuzzi in the bedroom was key after long days of walking up and down the strip. not to mention the 4 wall-mounted lcd tvs and the projector which displays on the shade over the living room window. an excellent room to be sure. I must say that there were a couple of minor issues: a piece of the jacuzzi was broken and when we checked in, they thought we had booked a studio room at the 1-bedroom rate. both of these issues were fixed VERY quickly. we called the front desk a few times (the jacuzzi and a couple of questions about the function of the washer/dryer and tvs) and they had people come up in less than 5 minutes. all staff were very nice and courteous to us at all times. housekeeping was very flexible when we asked them to come back later and always asked us if there was anything else we needed. also, keep in mind that the internet costs $$ (wired and wireless). I found that a bit annoying but that seems to be the standard among hotels now so I can't blame that on the PH Towers. all in all this is an excellent hotel and the fact that it's connected to the Miracle Mile shops (a whole bunch of cool restaurants and shops along with the main PH casino; Planet Dailies is an excellent choice for breakfast).

When I spoke on the phone to the front desk attendant I asked if I could request the highest floor possible in my rate range. She said that I would have to do that at check in so I didn't have high hopes when we checked in so late. But when we arrived we were the only ones checking in.

The bedroom had a huge bed and TV, a desk, the huge windows and a large spa tub. I wasn't too thrilled with the tub being in the bedroom but I got over it quick! The bathroom was large also with a doorless shower, lots of counter space, a TV and a washer/dryer. The only thing I didn't like about the bathroom is that it only had one sink. The best part by far was the remote control shade that came down over the curtainless windows. The shade in the den acts like a screen for the projection TV that is mounted in the ceiling! My husband was in heaven watching ESPN! It was definitely cool! The room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The maid always left us a huge amount of towels.

We had booked a two bedroom unit and at check in were offered an upgrade to a larger room for $100 extra per night. We declined this - but maybe we got the upgrade anyway as our rooms were huge. We were on the 55th floor (5526/5524) and the views were incredible looking out over MGM, NY NY, Excalibur and Luxor. The rooms were very luxurious with all the mod cons and our teenagers loved the gadgetry - especially being able to watch movies/tv on the projector screen. Beds were extremely comfy and had no problems with anything in our rooms not working. There was no bedding for the sofa bed, but rang through to housekeeping and it was brought up to us within 10 minutes. Housekeeping staff were wonderful and did a fantastic job - especially having to clean around two teenage girls who had spread makeup and clothes over every surface. They were quite happy to return when we weren't ready for them the first time they came as well. Only two problems - could never get valet parking as it was always full - even on the quiet nights at the start of the week. However, we soon sussed out that parking on level 3 (3B) gave us direct entry to the PH Towers lobby. Second issue was that one evening our lift mulfunctioned and became stuck between the 55th and 54th floors. We could not get any response from the emergency call number so had a panicky 10 minutes before we managed to get the lift to return to the 55th floor. Were very wary of the lifts after that. When we advised the front desk staff of our ordeal they were extremely apologetic and called the Manager for us. He was terrific and immediately had the lifts tested and followed up with the service department as to why they did not respond to our emergency call.

I couldn't agree more, this hotel is GREAT. 6 of us paid to stay in 3 studio rooms. When we went to check in we found out that they had no rooms side by side. We didn't want to be seperated so we asked if there was something they could do. For 30$ extra a day 4 of us upgraded to a higher floor with side by side rooms that were twice the size of a studio. I'm talking jacuzzi in the room, projection screen tv, 5 other flat screen tvs, pull out sofa that is a king size sleeper, full kitchen with dishes and all appliances, dining table etc etc... After arriving in our two new rooms we were blown away. I have been to vegas a few times and this room was ridiculous! It was great, but then we were told by the nicest hotel concierge that for only $20 more a night we could stay in a giant two bedroom suite with panoramic views and it is even better then the first upgrade. We gave it a shot. And it was the best thing we ever did. The room was unbeleivable. It was bigger than our 1100 squre foot appartment. Everyone who came back to party from other hotels couldn't beleive our room. It was like a penthouse suite on the 52 floor. Corner panoramic floor to ceiling windows, jacuzzi tub facing the view that fits 3, two complete bathrooms with double rain shower heads, washer and dryer. I can't begin to explain how great this room is. If you are wondering the room number it is 5234. It's nice when you go away with friends or a larger group that you have a place to relax in or party in where you don't have to sit on someones bed. This two bedroom suite was great for all of that. As for the actual hotel, I loved the location above the mall. It was easy to get around, lots of shops and restaurants, close to the center of the strip. Everyone who worked there was very friendly. We called to get extra towels and they came in 10 minutes. The room was clean. The fridge had an ice maker and a dishwasher. Cons that I can think of are: Small pool area We are in our early thirties and late twenties. I did not see many older people or young children at this hotel. I would definetly say it is meant for a 20-40 crowd. But it wasn't like a cancun spring break crowd either.

The suite was at least twice the size of any of the rooms or suites we had stayed in the US in the three weeks of our vacation. The master bedroom had a huge double bed, a single relaxing day bed and a large Jacuzzi. There was a double mirrored wardrobe (closet in the US) with a safe, iron and ironing board. The room was well decorated, well lit and the view from the full height windows was fantastic. The lounge area had an L shaped sofa that pulled in to a sofa bed, it also had a wardrobe and other storage, the teenagers had so much space they did not know what to do with it. They particularly enjoyed dropping the blinds in the evening and watching a movie \u2013 cinema style using the in room projector onto the huge screen. Also in the main room was the full kitchen (no pots or pans) including a dishwasher and full sized fridge and water filter/ cooler /ice maker. There was seating for six at the high level table. The bathroom was also a good size with a TV (one of 4 in the suite) had a double sink unit, plenty of storage, a washing machine / dryer (very useful after 2 weeks away) a walk in shower and WC cubicle complete with telephone. We had a fantastic time at this hotel and despite it getting very busy at the weekend we did not have to queue for anything or wait for anything. The swimming pool is a good size and when it was not too busy we used the full 30 yards to swim in and cool off. At the weekend in the afternoons the pool was full of people standing cooolng of - so dont expect to swim then. We were invited to a time share presentation \u2013 the offer of free show tickets to tempt us \u2013 we would have gone if we were without the children, but if they had come along they would have nagged us to sign up!

There was no toilet paper when we arrived in our unit and we waited several hours before we were able to get some.

The washer/dryer is European and all in one unit. Trying to figure out how to operate that was a journey in itself. There were no instructions for that or the microwave. Our sleeper sofa had no bedsheets at all and when we requested some it took over two hours for them to bring them to our room.

The room was amazing, a kitchen/living room with 2 huge flat screen TV's, red leather couch (that we later discovered was also a pull out bed), table with seating for 6, full size fridge/freezer, microwave oven + hob, and the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me was that then you lowered the blind over the floor to ceiling window's, it turned into a screen for a projector so you could watch TV on a huge screen !!.

The bathroom was equally well equipped, with a large shower, his + her's sink's, a washer/dryer and a small flat screen TV !!. This was one of the best room's I've ever stayed in. The only minor gripe with the room was that all the flat surfaces are black so they end up looking very dusty/dirty pretty quickly and for a newly built hotel in Vegas, there are no balconies unless you have a suite at the very top of the building. The other minor thing that annoyed us about the hotel was as others have said, was having to walk through the miracle mile shopping centre every time you wanted to get to the strip, which added 10 mins each way to your journey. The pool area, was a pretty good place to hang out, with nice tunes playing through the loudspeakers, although this might not be to everyone's taste.

Arrived at the hotel just before midnight, and there was no line up so check in was fast. We got 3 rooms right next to each other on the 30th floor. We were given no information about the hotel and amenities, but was informed that there would be a $50 deposit for incidentals (but didn't explain what that meant). As there were 3 adults staying in one of the suites, we called housekeeping at 1:00 am to bring some sheets, blankets and pillows for the pull out sofa. They said they would be right there. I called again at 2:00 am, they apologized and said they would be right there. They never did show up and the guest on the sofa bed had to use towels to keep warm. The next day I went to the checkin counter and asked them to have someone send up sheets and blankets for the pull out sofa and I told them that we never received them the night before. We got them within the hour. We also called from another of our rooms for sheets and blankets to make up another sofa bed, but they sent up 3 sheets and no blankets. Instead of calling housekeeping on the phone, there is a line that is for anything/anytime, and this line was much better than calling housekeeping. The housekeeping was sketchy. Some days our rooms didn't get cleaned and we had to call. Called them around 4:00 pm one day and they showed up around 10:00 pm, so we went out then. When we returned, the housekeeper had turned on the dishwasher and there was water and suds all over the kitchen floor. I called the anywhere/anytime line and they had someone come to clean up in about 10 minutes. (It leaked again a couple of days later). The carpet in the hallways needed to be vacuumed more often. The water pressure in the shower is very weak and the water does not drain quickly enough in the sinks, so they always look dirty. The washer/dryer takes forever. The decor of the room is really nice and the projector screen feature was awesome. However, because of the material of the headboard, dresser, counters, etc and all really dark, the dust is very noticeable. The light over the dining table had beer stoppers on it, so I don't think the rooms ever get a really good cleaning. As some of these suites are for time-shares, they were well equipped with dishes, utensils, etc. Each room had 2 bottles of water and coffee but we didn't know if we would be charged for drinking them or if they were part of the $50 incidentals. We had to ask. They are free. Incidentals mean that if you order room service, etc. After 2 days, we went to the customer information desk to ask about shows and she mentioned that there was an information package that we should have received when we checked in. It contained a PH Towers mug, information on how to operate the washer/dryer and a map of the area, etc. This is where they try to get you to the time share seminar. I am single and was with my sister and her husband. When she found out that I was single, she totally ignored me then did the hard sell to my sister and husband. If you spend 2 hours at a seminar, they give you show tickets for 1/2 price. They resisted. The location of the hotel was good. Had to walk about 10 minutes through the Miracle Mile shops to get to the casino but that was no big deal. The pool area was also very nice. We went shopping at the Premium Outlets and cost about $20 in a cab. The day before we checked out, the manager of the hotel was going around asking for feedback. As the hotel only opened in December, there still seemed to be a few kinks to work out. I told him everything (especially not receiving blankets) and he had heard that from someone else as well. He did apologize but we were never offered any kind of discount for our inconveniences. We did receive a very good deal on the room when we booked, as it is still a fairly new hotel. Not sure if we would stay there again, as I am sure you can get a good deal at other hotels as well.

We pulled up for valet which had a sign saying it was full but we weren't sure where to go to check in and unload luggage because of taxis and other cars. At least five valets were standing around ignoring us even though we needed help. We gave up and went to self park and hauled our bags through the mall to check in. Front desk staff(Kelly) was extremely nice and we immediately complained about valet which she apologized for-made no excuses but said she would call and talk to them about it. We requested a high floor and she gave us a room on the 52nd floor! We had the 1 bedroom king suite since we were traveling with our 14 y/o and the room was amazing!! We had a view of the north strip, could see the Bellagio fountain. However, the bedroom window was dirty-oh, simple handprints would have been tolerable but it was pretty obvious that this was the print of an amorous couple using the window for support and the beautiful view as their foreground. NOT pleasant but we checked the rest of the room and the cabinet door for the washer/dryer was broken. We immediately reported those items to the front desk staff who were apologetic and said they would have it taken care of. We left for dinner and a little gambling and when we returned the door had been fixed but the window was still not cleaned. Called the front desk fairly irate and forcefully requested housekeeping ASAP. Within 2 min we had a call saying they would be there in 5-10 min and about 2 min later they arrived. He cleaned all the windows very thoroughly and made sure we were satisfied before leaving (we tipped him even because we were so impressed by him). The rest of the stay was WONDERFUL-quiet, great views of the fireworks (we were there for the 4th). We are already talking about our next stay there and want to take friends!

There are no smoky casinos\u2019s to walk through and the entire resort is smoke free. It's a very contemporary hotel and it is very clean. We were given a room on the 29th floor. There were already signs of some wear on the doors since they are black and I wonder how hard it would be to give these things quick touch ups. The room was spacious but there were lights that didn't work. After talking with some other guests we found this was a common theme. For a newer hotel this just seemed odd. The TV is setup to control parts of the room like lights and temp. However the controls are very slow and getting up and manually making the changes is faster. We 1 guest complain on the elevator their door fell off when they checked in. Then another complained they were checked into an occupied room. We used the pool and on Monday we were checked by security just to get to it. They made sure we didn't bring any drinks in not even a coke that we bought from their mall. What was nice about that is then they had no bar service or way to get a beverage of any kind in 100 degree heat all day at the pool. Security was not very nice about this policy. On Tuesday we decided we wouldn't bring anything to drink since we couldn't the day before but then noticed a sign that said no alcoholic beverages. However they weren't letting you bring in anything so they could force you to buy the overpriced drinks at the pool. On Tuesday unlike Monday they searched our bags. We can bring in 10 bags into our room without being searched but one pool bag is a security threat. I was amazed by the lack of style and class for this type of place. On Thursday I couldn't get a signal to save my life on my cell phone in my room. So I had to use their phones to make a long distance call. It did last about 60 minutes. Well, I checked out and noticed that 1 call to a US number cost me $169. You can buy unlimited plans for nothing and businesses pay hardly anything. Nothing on the phone to indicate they are about to empty your checking account if you use this service. When we checked out the attendant asked how our stay was and I told her. MGM Signature was way classier, who wants to be harassed just to use a pool, why would I want to buy a vacation package from them? , and that they really took advantage of the guests on domestic long distance.

(Their web picture also shows what appear to be cooking utensils in the background!) However, when we got to our room and started looking for pots, pans and cooking utensils we did not find any. I called the front desk and was informed that only \"owners\" were supplied with cooking utensils and pots and pans. I asked then why did their web site advertises a full kitchen and why was there a range top and plates and and silverware, etc.? If I could not cook here, I would have booked elsewhere. He said he agreed and he was new and did I want to speak to a manager. I said yes. That was around 4PM. By ~6PM we had not heard anything back so I called again and went thru the whole rigamarole again - and I said the manager had never called - even though their computer indicated I had spoken to him (???!!!) She said she understood my issue and would have housekeeping send up the requested items. We went out to dinner and got back ~7:30PM - no pots, pans, etc. I visited the desk in person this time. The gentleman assured me he would get right on it since someone had told me they would be delivered. We went to a show and got back ~10PM - still nothing. I called again and this gentleman birddogged the problem until we got the requested items ~ 11:45 PM. Other than this initial hassle, our stay was really great. The room was very nice, the pool though small with minimal shade areas had multiple depths for all. The location is excellent. The blackout blinds and noise reduction in the rooms work quite well.

There was a full kitchen with dishwasher, stove, and full size fridge, a dining table, sectional sofa, jacuzzi in bedroom, washer/dryer, TV in each room, and a projector TV on a screen that comes down and covers the whole window.

We chose the Planet Hollywood towers, as we have stayed in both the MGM Signature, and the Planet Hollywood. We liked the room size and design of the MGM Signature, but the atmosphere of the Planet Hollywood cannot be beat! From start to finish everything was awesome! We parked in the self parking, and when were parking we saw the entrance to the lobby right next to the parking lot, and headed to check in. Check in was a breeze, we requested a north facing room on a high floor, after reading other's reviews. When I hear we were only on the 12th floor I was a little bummed, but when we got to the room the view was great! Also, the room was awesome. We got settled right in and tested the projection screen, it was very easy to use, so don't know what people who had problems before had difficulty with. The room was clean, and had everything we needed, except it was missing sheets for the pull out couch. We called housekeeping, and they answered the phone immediately, and brought us a set of sheets, and blankets within a few minutes. I did notice a very small amount of wear and tear in the hallway, but it is Vegas, and party goers are rough on the property, there was nothing too extreme. There was a small amount of dust around the edges, but it was quite obvious the floors had been vacuumed recently. The last night we took advantage of the hot tub in the room, which was amazing! I will definitely stay here, it was amazing. Also if you stay here you should check out Holly Madison's Peepshow, I was a bit apprehensive as it is a burlesque show, but the boys in the group really wanted to go (for obvious reasons), and I am so glad that we did!

Went to room, not the best view not the worst 14 floor. The room wasn't completely clean, you could tell no one had been there in awhile dust, fingerprints, tub not real clean. But nothing very bad. The room itself was wonderful, the TV's the 2 bedrooms and baths. Much better than a hotel room. The kitchen was great to , we had all appliances, blender for drinks etc... It took a bit to figure out the projection TV and washer/dryer (European style). Great couch to hand out with friends and table, ordered in one night. We were there 3 nights, our floor was quiet. Never heard another person or noise at night. We cleaned up ourselves the 1st day, 2nd day housekeeping came and did a good job, cleaned up the bedrooms and bath left what we needed. I liked that the condo was quiet, good location to walk to casino and mall but not in the casino with all the noise and people in the lobby. On the negatives: The pool is not the one in the photos, they even had a large sign in their lobby with a big pool with sand etc around it with a tagline \"best pool in Vegas\" Now Open\" asked the guy where is this pool..he acted like he did not know what I was talking about, I showed him the 6ft sign and he said\" oh that one must not be finished yet!\" Pool that is open is small, no food to order, no shade and when it was 110 needed some. Umbrellas they did have all blew into the pool and hit people as they were not weighed down.

They one guy Chuck tried to tell us we could get three nights free and dinner, and show tickets if we sat through the presentation. When I went back and talked to another guy he said that was ridiculous!!!!! and you could get $100 in credits. IF you want more info make sure you talk to the company directly not the sales guys, they do not know what is what. I tried to get some other info for clients and they didnt have any info. said check the website! Just do not sign anything on site. Seemed to be a young party crowd on the weekend, I think the price point is too low and is bringing in the young partiers. I feel bad for owners of this property, if could be a great modern upscale resort if they fine tuned some issues.

The Westgate Towers is the newest addition on the strip, but already has a reputation of poor quality and service. The building is beautiful, location is great. It is inside a nice mall with great food, casino, shows, parking garage, and walking distance to most everything. When I first arrived they lost my reservation after flying 5 hours! I booked it through Interval International and they failed to provide me with a correct confirmation number and booked it under the wrong name. This was not PH's fault, but we were there for 2 hours trying to figure it all out. My God! I had all the paperwork confirming everything. Instead of focusing on solving the problem, for 2 hours they focused on who's fault the error was. They should have simply accomodated me and sorted it out later. They were actually NOT going to give me a room and I would have been stranded in Las Vegas! The staff were distracted, unorganized and ghetto. They gave me a room. Later I spoke with the manager because I wanted an upgrade after all I had been through. The lack of customer service continued, DANA, the manager, said she would look in to what happened (once again with the blaming and finding out whose fault it was) did not call me back after two days! Finally, I went to the front desk and raised HELL and the shift manager (Tonita Mack) and desk clerk had more courtesy than apparently their manager because when I raised hell they went on and on about how it wasn't their fault (again) but gave me the upgrade. They admit there were \"too many hands in the pot\" when it came to reservations but would accomodate me. Finally!! Why did it take 3 days for someone to understand good old fashion customer service. But the saga continues. The upgrade we got was not cleaned, projector was broken, chairs had black dust and dirt on them, hand prints on the shower doors and walls, tub had a ring of dirt, and the shower knob came off!! How can a place that has just been built already be a dump? We stayed on the 56th floor which apparently housekeeping doesn't get up to that often. The hallways were filthy, the same cups and glasses left in the hallway stayed the entire week I was there. Laundry detergeant stayed on the floor the whole week. When I called housekeeping they half cleaned the room leaving dirty q-tips on our floor and a remaining dirt circle around the tub, glass stains on the counters. The projector guy was awesome, he came right away and fixed it. Yea for the maintenance people!! The pool was nice, cabana's seemed nice. If you are the first one to rent one you get a discount, $250 for the day. To summarize, I say it's a tragedy because it appears PH bit off more than they could chew. The furniture and equipment is lovely but requires high maintenance and they just don't have the staff to clean it, all 56 floors and keep it in order. Here are some tips for the resort and the area for folks on a budget: 1. Best deal is a 1 bedroom with a FULL kitchen at PH (but I suggest you stay somewhere else!!!) 2. If you buy drinks, water, snacks, Walgreen's is within walking distance, the snacks in the mall is overpriced, Walgreen's open 24/7 3. You can do Vegas with or without a car, just be prepared to walk a lot regardless 4. PH has their own garage, awesome deal if you do have a car, garage parking is free in Vegas, heavy traffic starts Thursday nights, after 6pm forgetta bout it 5. Valet parking nice at different hotels, it's worth the few bucks, especially if you are trying to catch shows on time 6. ABC store cheapest souvenirs in mall, also some off-strip stores cheapest if you have a car 7. Need a quick outfit- Ross's is just off strip and huge, get a nice outfit cheap 8. Awesome shows- any Cirque Soleil show is amazing (Mystere was great) and if you have the money, see \"O\" at the Bellagio!! Wayne Brady is funny also. They also have a schedule of shows in little books in the lobby of PH. 9. PAY NOTHING REGULAR PRICE: there are discount kiosks on the strip and the concierge desk that offer coupons for food, shows, tours and stuff 10. SPA? A Touch of Las Vegas will come to your room or pool side or save and go to them. There place isn't much to look at from the outside but they are super nice and professional, 702-871-0899. The french toast dipped in creme is delicious at the restaurant in the PH casino, food is good at Harley cafe, cheap burgers at In and Out Burgers off the strip, sbarro pizza is in the mall, order a whole pie and not by the slice if you are really watching dollars. Vegas has so much more, you have to keep coming back and back. I hope this helps a little.

We booked a regular suite and paid extra for an upper level room. Here was our experience: Things didn't start out well because when we arrived (drove from So. Cal.) there was a sign that said \"Valet Parking Full\". As we drove to find self-parking we noticed a lot of empty spots in the Valet Parking area so drove back and stopped to ask for help. Finally a Valet person walked up and said \"I suppose I can fit you in\". Went up to check in and there were two lines. One for hotel guests (us) and one for owners. There are about 10 terminals behind the desk but there were only 2 people working them. Any time there was an owner in line they took them first. Even though there was only about 2 people ahead of us it took about 30 minutes. I realized when she gave me the room number 21-XXX that something seemed not right since I had paid for the upper level room but I couldn\u2019t remember how many floors there were so I thought we\u2019d just check it out. Went up to the room and realized there were I think 56 floors. There\u2019s two banks of elevators for something like 3-28 and 29-56. Since 21 wasn\u2019t even in the second bank of elevators it sure didn\u2019t seem like it should be considered an \u201cupper level\u201d room! Went into the room and it was much smaller than we had expected. The kitchenette was extremely small with mini-everything. The view was facing the airport with not a whole lot to look at. The jucuzzi tub was in the bathroom and was pretty small. I think two people in there would have been pretty cramped. We have stayed frequently at the Signature and their junior suites put this one to shame! Since we felt that we didn\u2019t get the \u201cupper-level\u201d room that we paid for I tried calling the Front Desk- never got an answer. Tried again and finally was switched over to Guest Services who said that they can\u2019t help and I had to talk to the Front Desk. So finally we packed up and headed back down to the Front Desk. After waiting in line about another 30-40 minutes we were told that anything above the 15th floor is considered \u201cupper-level\u201d. Also, since the PH Towers sits sort of sideways to the Strip they considered every room a Strip view so would not change rooms based on view. The view we had towards the airport is South-Strip. The better view towards Paris, etc., is North-Strip view which is much better. After asking what my options were they offered to upgrade to a 1-bedroom North-Strip view for an extra $50/night which I begrudgingly took. This room was on the 50th floor and the difference was like night and day! The 1-bedrooms are huge and beautiful. The kitchen is large, big table, sectional sofa, and this one has the projector TV (although had to call Guest Services who sent someone up to show us how to use it). There are a lot of fancy controls in the room and absolutely nothing explaining how to use any of them. There is definitely a separate closed off bedroom. The bathroom has two doors where you can enter from the bedroom or the living area. What\u2019s very different about this room is that the Jacuzzi tub is actually in the bedroom itself and not in the bathroom (more on that later). The bathroom has a separate shower with rainhead that has extremely low water pressure! The toilet is in a stall-like thing with a frosted glass door but it\u2019s not a full door (doesn\u2019t go to floor or ceiling) so there\u2019s really no privacy if someone else is in the bathroom. About the Jacuzzi tub- we used it fine the first two nights. Very romantic that you can sit and see out the window (over the bed) for the Vegas lights, however, the last night we were there the GF was in it and turned the jets on and, for whatever reason this time, the jets shot water straight up in the air and literally flooded the bed!! We had to have maid service come up and change all of the bedding at 1:30am. The maid was actually a real sweetheart about it and she showed up fairly quickly. Pros: - Location- Great walking downstairs and being right in Miracle Mile for restaurants, etc. - Jacuzzi tub was great but be careful (make sure jets are not pointing up!!). - Great views from floor to ceiling windows - Projector TV was awesome though never really used it- it\u2019s Vegas! Cons: - Lines at Front Desk are very slow - Junior suites not very big - Valet Parking should never be full! - Water pressure is terrible in shower -Need to flush toilets multiple times - \u201cUpper Level\u201d rooms can sometimes not be very high (above 15) - Only nice pool day we had the pool was packed.

Nope. Despite ordering a crib in advance, we get it delivered to our room several hours after we check in. Room service? How about a chicken wrap (seriously, that was about it, even the bell hop told us not to bother). Great news, though, we have a full kitchen...

We've typically gotten a couple of standard rooms at various hotels on the Strip in the past, but decided to make a change to the PH Towers and get a 2-bedroom suite instead. Booked the room directly through the PH Towers site, and was given a 30% discount for Grand Opening special. I was slightly nervous based on reading some of the reviews of prior guests, but I can honestly tell you that our stay and experience was a great one. We arrived on a Wednesday morning, and breezed through check-in. Since the hotel is fairly new, they are still training the staff, so you might have to exercise some patience; but the people that took care of us were very friendly. I also asked for an upgrade to a room with a better view, and they were more than happy to provide to us - and even recommended that we take a room with a North view of the Strip. Upon getting into the room, it was all it was supposed to be - generally clean, no broken amentities, etc. The view of the Effiel Tower and northern Strip was great! The five flat-panel TVs, as well as the floor-to-ceiling projection screen , were awesome - we took some time away from the tables to watch some MLB and NHL, and it felt like we were sitting right up against the boards. The room did have a washer/dryer combo as well, but it does use steam clean technology, so make sure you aren't washing jeans. Also, we did receive maid service daily here - beds were made, towels refreshed, and garbages emptied - unlike some of the other previous reviews. Pool was clean, and never too crowded, even when the weather was 85-90 degrees every day. Finally, the walk to the casino from the hotel is relatively short - only about 5 minutes through the mall. Considering the amount of walking you will likley do in Vegas anyway, it's really not that bad. Plus, the hotel is in a great spot on the Strip - centrally located - which gives you walking options in either direction. Only a few minor issues to bring up during our stay: 1. As mentioned above, room was generally clean. We did find one toothpaste cap under one of the dressers, but otherwise fine. The hallway carpets sometimes appeared dirty, but I think that is mostly due to the dark colors in the carpeting. 2. There was a slight mixup upon checkin with the name on the room (it was registered under one of my buddies' names, even though my cc was on the room already), but they found our reservation using the confirmation number I was given and apologized immediately for the confusion. 3. You are not allowed to bring your own drinks to the pool - we were turned away one day, and told that we had to buy drinks from the pool bar only - $7 cans of beer, $12-15 drinks. 4. The water pressure in the showers were non-existant, so prepare accordingly. The water pressure in the sinks and tubs were fine, though. 5. If you are checking in on the weekend (Friday/Saturday), be prepared to wait - the lines were extremely long when we walked through the lobby. Overall, we had a great experience at the PH Towers - it's a great value for the price, and the location can't be beat.

After staying at the Signature, I wanted a better view with all the kitchen and space of the aforementioned property. I did some research on the hotel by reading trip-advisor reviews and searching the PH Towers web page. However, I did not catch some of the details that mattered to me as the wife of the man on a business trip. Summary of stay Arrival: This experience was a let down from the beginning. We drove up the awkward approach to the valet and the staff just stood there. We got out of the car and started to walk toward the valet staff (four people standing at the desk and no other cars around) and one man took a couple steps toward us, stopped, and commented \"are you staying here?\" After we said \"we are trying to check in,\" this man started to walk toward us. I thought that we may not have had a new enough SUV to get appropriate attention. The odd thing about the arrival was that the valet staff was just talking among themselves and seemed to view our automobile as a non-entity until we started to approach them on foot (which meant we had already been out of the car and opening the back doors before we started to walk toward the valet staff). The Room (so much to say): On the negative side, I didn't catch the fact that all suites are not as described in the main page on room descriptions. The main page claims that King Suites have a separate shower and spa tub. However, my room as a single jacuzzi tub that is the shower (see photo). The photos I saw show a double jacuzzi tub and my room has a single jacuzzi tub (customer service says no rooms have double jacuzzi tubs). I didn't catch the fact that the upscale stainless steel appliances in the room do not include a toaster and a blender (when I asked, the first time, for the toaster and blender, I was told that if my room didn't have these appliances, I wouldn't get them. Toasters and blenders were only in time share rooms. HOwever, when I went to the front desk, I was told that a request for these appliances would be put into the system but no guarantee). Before bed - around 10pm, I got the toaster and blender (which I use). I didn't see that the \"kitchenette\" is really a glorified wet bar with a smaller than the bathroom sink. Although the room has a dishwasher, I feel guilty using it for five dishes but I have to because I don't have another way to do dishes due to the tiny sink. I didn't catch the fact that the room is smaller than the other aforementioned hotel and really is the same size at a hotel room at the Las Vegas Hilton. I didn't catch the fact that the pillows are all foam. I almost always get one feather pillow or a really flat pillow at the hotels we stay in. In this hotel, there were many pillows but all foam and rather thick. I called and requested a feather/down pillow but got none despite being told that I would get that down pillow within a few minutes. Moreover, when we walked into the room, it smelled like a chemical. I can't identify the smell exactly but it kinda made me feel ill the whole night. The smell was so bad, for me, that I wanted to leave the room as soon as possible. In fact, we did leave the room soon after arriving and stayed gone for hours. When we came back, the smell was still there and it wasn't until the next day that I adjusted to the smell and felt okay. There is a strange humming noise coming through the air system that makes the room sound like an airplane in take-off. Given we are on the 52nd floor, I haven't been in a high rise business tower that continually sounded like a plane in take-off, with that high pitched hum that gains intensity as the plane accelerates, and it was a bit disturbing because I started thinking about 9/11 when trying to fall asleep due to the air-system noise and the background plane noise from the airport. I actually thought that this hotel is high enough to get hit by a plane from the airport - should something go wrong with a plane. I have never had any fear thoughts in high rise hotels anywhere in the U.S. or Europe. Also, there are no dresser drawers for our clothes and no closet kit in the closet so we can't put away clothes. Even a typical hotel room has a dresser for clothes. We have a desk and a couple drawers in the nigh stands. These little things about the room matter and I don't want to stay here again and my neck hurts after not getting a flatter pillow. On the positive side, the bed is comfortable. The view is spectacular. The carpet is nice. The room is decorated nicely with swank artwork. Although we have an adjoining door, the room is quiet and I only heard a few doors slamming last night. The Customer Service: The customer service is not good. I read someone, on tripadvisor, write that the customer service staff had a snobbish European attitude and I'd say that this vibe is alive and well among most of the front desk staff and the phone staff. When I first called \"anything/anytime\" line, I was told to call the operator and ask for a supervisor to get answers to my questions about the room. When I called the supervisor, which in itself was an intimidating call because I didn't want to call a supervisor to ask basic questions about the room, I concluded that the appliances I needed weren't going to be an option because I wasn't a time share owner. When I verbalized my conclusion to the \"supervisor\" by stating \"so, I guess if the room doesn't already have the toaster and blender, I'm not getting these things\" and the reply was \"this is correct.\" However, when I went to the front desk and asked for these appliances and explained someone on the phone was quite rude when I asked about these appliances, a friendly woman said she would put in the request. One out of five interactions with the guest services here was good. The View: The reason why I chose this hotel was because the room at the aforementioned property, which was supposed to be a strip view, looked at the PH Towers and I figured the view to be had was from the PH Towers. I was not let down by the view. I did ask for a room with a view of the Belagio fountains and was told \"there are no rooms with a view of the strip from this hotel.\" Then I was asked which side of Vegas I wanted to see from my room. I chose to get a room with a view of North Las Vegas. When I got to my room, it wasn't dark and I did see that I could see some water from Belagio and the Paris Eiffel Tower. I was surprised, when we got back to the room after sun-down, to see that we had a great view of the Belagio fountain and water show and an expansive panoramic vegas view from the 52nd floor. Fabulous view and I can't say enough about the view but I wouldn't have guessed the view was special based upon the front desk clerk with a crappy attitude and I didn't see how special the view was until sun-down.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nelson", "Title": "\u201cGood value if you can put up with hit and miss service.\u201d", "Author": "TheCameleer", "ReviewID": "UR64422869", "Content": "Tidy rooms and fantastic views from our 51st floor room.

Last year we stayed at Encore but wanted something more centrally located this time around. To be fair, we received an unbelievable package price through Orbitz for this property. I was in no terms expecting what we received at Encore last year, either in service, room quality, amenities, etc. We paid a total of $348 for 3 nights, including tax, for a 1 bedroom suite and full size car through Hertz for 4 days. I could have spent $50 more and stayed at Vdara or Encore, but we wanted to try something new and the 1 bedroom suites looked pretty cool. Check -in: We arrived at the hotel around 10:30 am on a Thursday morning and were allowed to check-in early, +1. It should be noted that there was only 1 check-in person working at this time, and never more than 2 that I could see during my stay. This meant extremely long lines for those checking in during peak times, which pretty much started Thursday afternoon and continued through Saturday. Room: We were given our 1 Bedroom Suite on the 30th floor looking North, with a view of the Eiffle Tower, plus some parking garages, etc. Room was probably 800 sq. ft. by my accounts. Overall, the room looks really, really cool, but is done on the cheap for sure. The kitchen was nice, stocked with dirty glasses, plates, and silverware, didn't bother to call for them to be cleaned since we wouldn't use them. The living room had a very large, and comfortable red sectional sofa, which also had a sofa sleeper. Our room also included a washer/dryer combo, with supplies for it in the kitchen, but we never used it. In room safe had plenty of room for my Macbook Pro (15.4 inch) Canon G11, money, wallets, etc. The bed was comfortable by my standards, not up to Wynn/Encore, but better than I expected. The sheets and pillow cases, however, were extremely low quality. The pillow cases felt almost like sandpaper and looked like they had been bought used, in bulk, from the GoodWill. The HD projector was pretty cool, until it broke, at which point they offered to move us but we declined as we had several other Plasmas in the room. The door to the master bedroom was also broken, i.e. not put on correctly, and would not shut. It took two maintenance guys to resolve this, and took them about an hour to arrive after calling. These guys are being working to death, so go easy on em. The whole time they were trying to fix our projector/bedroom door, both of their radios were going off non-stop for fixes in other rooms. For close to 40 minutes we started to understand how cheap the finish work was on this place as the calls just kept coming, and coming, and coming, to fix stuff in guest\u2019s rooms. Based on my travel history, I will typically stay in a higher end property due to nicer mattresses, shower, service, and property amenities. This room met my needs in almost every area, except for the shower. At first glance, you are wowed. It is a hugely beautiful, tiled, walk in shower with a rain-plate head and sitting bench which may have been able to fit my extremely petite girlfriend, but even she would have struggled. They must have the most restrictive flow regulator on these heads as the water barely came out at a trickle. The faucet emitted about 4-5x the water pressure of the shower, so, ladies, I suggest doing your hair in the sink if you don\u2019t want to take a 45-60 minute shower here. Pool: really loved the pool area, great chairs, and sun almost all day. Music volume was nice and not too in your face like some properties. They also had a nice selection of cabanas, which had their own Plasma, but I did not inquire about the price. Parking: Garage is attached to this property, unlike the Planet Hollywood, with a direct side entrance to the PH Towers. This made for quick in/out during our stay. The valet service here was also quick and friendly, although they will not let you call down in advance for your vehicle (turned out to be a moot point however since they were really fast in bringing the car around). As my review is titled, this is really a mixed-bag property. If you want a really large, and superficially nice room mid-strip, with a great pool and very little customer service, this is for you. If you are comparing this property to Venetian/Palazzo, Wynn/Encore, TheHotel, etc, it does not stack up. If you can get it for a steal like we did, however, its faults are easy to overlook for a short 3-4 day trip.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "travel10Canada", "ReviewID": "UR63803054", "Content": "Great place to stay.

I go to vegas at least 2-3 times per year and you can guarantee I'm staying here every time. Perfect location, unbelievable prices and HUGE rooms. I certainly can look over a broken handle or a little slow response for this kind of room at this price. I wasn't asked about a time share once the whole time we were there either. I acutally expected it and didn't get it. It was a little chilly by the pool but service was fast and very nice. The cabanas will be great when the season comes.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cI really wanted to love it, but it missed the mark\u201d", "Author": "amadowns", "ReviewID": "UR62699021", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in a 1 bedroom king suite with a fantastic view of the strip. The room was clean and nice and would be great with the exception of a few issues I just can't get past. There were no welcome or instruction materials on how to use any of the amenities - had trouble getting dryer to unlock my clothes, the projector was awesome, it just took a long time to figure out how to use it with the remotes (one of which didn't work on any of the TVs). Room service is only available through the TV which was temperamental and the toilet didn't flush well... at all. I realized these were likely issues that come with a new property, so they aren't a big deal in the whole scheme of things. Upon check-in we were waiting in line with several other guests and a gentleman from guest services walked up to us, no one else, and asked us if we were checking in. \"Yes\" I smiled! He asked for our name and I gave it to him, while he looked back at my husband (who is sometimes mistaken for an NBA player). He found my name on his list and said thank you. He then promptly walked away not help us, or anyone else who was in line. As he shifted back in his guest services chair, he whispered something to the other people he worked with that were standing around the table and carried on at his empty guest services desk people watching. Are you kidding me? We evidently aren't VIP's, thanks for the reminder. This didn't just put us off, but those around us waiting too. The pool is sub-par for Vegas, the toilet paper was sandpaper and Suave would have been an improvement over the shampoo & conditioner provided, which guests come to rely on with today's TSA restrictions on liquids/gels. PH Towers went cheap, and it shows. I would not recommend paying full price for a room here - discounted rates are even tough to justify. I really wanted to love it, I'm a reasonable person, they just have some work to do. They have a good canvas to work off of perhaps they'll figure it out before they earn a bad reputation.

I know the property is a few months old and you would think the kinks would have been worked out by now. When I checked in I was not told anything about the property. I had to ask about the pool and other amenities. My room was on the 52nd floor. As I exited the elevator and walked to the very end of the hallway I noticed that the carpets needed vacuuming. There was also a plate with a serving of ranch dressing on it, which remained there until Monday AM when I checked out. Gross! My room was nice but my automatic shades were broken. I called to have someone fix them but that never happened my entire stay, even after asking several times. The bathroom sink drained extremely slowly. I asked for that to be fixed as well but of course no one ever came. I did have housekeeping everyday but all they did was make up my bed and wipe down the bathroom counter. They never vacuumed or emptied my trash. I had to put my trash can in the hallway for it to be emptied. The beds and pillows were too hard for my liking. But there was a mini fridge, dishwasher, microwave and dishes in the room. That was a great plus! The location of the hotel is great! And the easy access to the Miracle Miles Shops is unbeatable. There is free wifi at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf inside the Shops. The pool was nice as well. It seemed as though it never got shaded. They play music and have a bar where a daiquiri is $10. I did see people bring in their own drinks that were purchased at the Fat Tuesdays in the Shops. Those frozen drinks are larger, stronger and cheaper. A taxi to the airport during no traffic was $10 and the taxi and valet attendants are very nice. Overall the property is nice and is in a great location\u2026..BUT the service is terrible!!!!! This is a time share property so I don\u2019t know if that has something to do with it or not. I\u2019ve stayed at a number of properties on the strip (Monte Carlo, Treasure Island, Riviera, Luxor, Trump, etc.) and they all have some minor issues.

I asked where that service was provided and he just stared at me blankly. I eventually walked him through the internet and how to use the website at United.com. He acted very put out the entire time. Do not call for a wake up call, they are late, and act very put out to provide the service. Also, don't expect housekeeping to show up, or even do anything with a sence of urgency.

At first I was a little nervous about staying here b/c so many people said it was \"so far\" off the strip - well those people must weigh 500+ pounds because it was literally RIGHT off the strip! It was a short walk either through the mall or you could go out the side and then right now the street - it wasn't even a block away. The good: -Room was very large -Nice view -Was very dark and quiet at night which is exactly what my husband and I wanted for sleeping. -Right off strip but just far enough off that you get a little break from the hustle bustle -Connected to a great mall for shopping and food etc. -Casino is located in PH so just a 2 minute walk - I actually liked this the most b/c unlike most hotels on the strip when you walk through you hear the constant ding ding ding of the casino whereas here you only enter the casino when you actually want to gamble -Nice pool area -Amazingly comfortable bed!!!!!! Bad: -Check in took awhile which was a little annoying - they need more people working the front desk at peak times -Pool needs more chairs - they get taken so fast on the weekends -A lot of little kids in the pool area on the weekend - fine during the week though We didn't have any issues in which we needed extra service or anything so I can't comment on that but our room was always clean and we had a great stay. Also right now Harrah's is running a promo - for $30 you get access to all 7 of their buffets (PH, Rio, Paris, Caesar's, etc) for 24 hours...so basically we bought it one night at 8pm and used it for dinner, breakfast, lunch and then dinner again - all for only $30!

Word of advice make sure that when taking the taxi or shuttle that you advise you are staying at the Westgate Towers of Planet Hollywood otherwise you will get dropped off at the wrong hotel. Service desk agent who checked us in was far from giving a great customer experience she was rude and did not care to hear nothing I had to say without interuppting me. Check in time is 4pm I got there at noon as I had an early flight. When I went to check in she stated no rooms available but I could upgrade to a 1br ste for an addtl $50 night or I could leave my bags with the bell hop. I was ok with that but she was just rude about it so I requested a manger and he more than accomodated us by getting us into a room. I am will not let one rude service person ruin my stay but I do beleive that they need to probable show the video Give Them The Pickle which is a customer service video.

Kitchen-very well equipped and the table was great. PH is definitely marketed for the young and hip crowd and I was concerned about possible hall noise and noisy neighbors. While in our room, we heard virtually no noise. No real cons, just some nit picky things: Valet was always full. A bit tacky. Fake palm trees and flowers in the lobby. Color scheme and decor in room were not to my liking but that is purely personal taste and did not take away from the comfort or functionality of the room. I absolutely hated the jacuzzi in the bedroom. Much better had they designed it to be included in the bathroom as opposed to 2 ft from the bed. The front desk staff could have been a little friendlier. Housekeeping was perfectly satisfactory as far as cleaning our suite, however the hallway carpet could use some serious attention.
