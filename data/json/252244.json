Several type of juice. The staff is very nice, serving you coffee, hot chocolate or cappucino. We had a drink to the bar, but did not ask for the room service (food). There is no restaurant per se in the hotel. The terrace is great, the view is beautiful. There was several good restaurants around, not too expensive and friendly staffed. The hotel is situated just a few minutes walk from the coliseum, and the metro station is just across the street (from the coliseum).

The breakfast buffet was abundant and excellent. The hotel reception staff are friendly, helpful, notably multilingual and have deep local knowledge. They very readily telephoned ahead to attractions to see about opening times and tickets and had suggestions for alternatives. There are at least three good local restaurants within three hundred metres so there is no need to return to the city centre to dine out.

I had booked through Expedia as this gave us the best price for the Hotel,Flights and Transfers. It is easy to get either the bus or train from Fiumicino Airport but as my Mum is 81 I knew it would be more comfortable if I booked a shared return transfer. On arriving at the hotel in the afternoon a Twin Room which we requested wasn't available until the following day, however they put a spare bed in a Double Room for us and we were happy with that. The following morning we headed for the Coliseum, I had already pre-booked one ticket for myself as Mum was entitled to free entry, you collect the free ticket when you get there just remember to take ID with you. When we got back to the hotel late afternoon our twin room was ready for us. The room was a great size, as was the bathroom, with a bath and overhead power shower, plus toiletries, bathrobes and slippers, brilliant mattresses, we were at the front of the hotel practically on the ground floor, there was a little noise disturbance but only on a couple of mornings when the dustbin men were doing their rounds which is to be expected especially if like me you sleep with the window open!! The 4th floor breakfast room was extremely welcoming and bright and we sat and had our breakfast on the terrence on a couple of occasions, the food was brilliant, all fresh and always being replenished, and you couldn't ask for a more welcoming atmosphere from the staff and a great start to your day. We found ALL the hotel staff extremely helpful and knowledgeable, they were all very solicitous especially to my mother and were very concerned when I had hurt my foot and provided me with an ice pack. The decor of the hotel is modern, bright and contemporary and extremely well maintained and clean. It is few minutes walk away from the Coliseum and either Metro Line, there are plenty of restaurants within a few minutes walk which are authentic and unspoilt by mass tourism.

I am so glad i did as it was out of this world. Such a great hotel in a brill location that really made our trip to Rome. Quick tip to anyone who is going to Rome and doesnt want to pay the 40 Euro transfer fee that some tour operators charge. Dont pay it. When you land in FCO it is so easy to get into the city centre. There is the train which takes only 30 mins and costs 14 Euros each way or the Coach costs 4 Euros each way! If you are doing the coach make sure you book a return at the same time so you get it at 8 Euros as if you just do the single for 4 Euros it will cost you 6 Euros to get back to airport!! The coach takes about an hour but it is a nice jorney and you get to see lots of Rome as it arrives into Termini. When we arrived into Termini we just hopped onto the metro which was two stops away from the Colosseum and cost us 1 Euro Each! Brilliant! When you walk out of the Colosseum metro stop you are right opposite the Colosseum and about three minutes walk away from the hotel. The hotel is located on Capo D'Africa street and is very close to about ten restuarants which are very well priced and have great menus. The hotel has a lovely reception area and the staff were brill when i checked in. They even gave us a map and pointed out all the tourist sites etc and explained how to get to them all. The Room didnt have an amazing view but the room itself was fantastic. Clean, Modern and had a lovely robe with slippers. The bed was great and very comfertable. The bathroom was a great size and again very clean. Another tip for Rome, Make sure you book your attraction tickets to avoid the long queues! If anyone has any questions on which ones to book etc and what to do please just send me a message and i will happily help you. I booked the Colosseum, Hop On Hop Off and Vactican City. The hotel breakfast is worth every penny and has a lot of choice and is very well presented. The morning staff were just as good as the recpetion staff.

The staff is extremely friendly and responsive, and the speak English relatively well down to the bell hops.

Now I get go back to the front desk as ask for help but this was the same group that when I asked about the package they gave me this; Web site stated this Under The Best Years of our Lives you were to get this package; The rate includes: 2 tickets valid for the Archeobus tourist bus, to discover Rome a new prospective 15% off on the Best Available Rate when booking (BAR) Complimentary Room-service breakfast for 2 people An upgrade to a Deluxe room depending on availability at the check-in time Vat and service So what did I get? They had no bus tickets and told me to book my own tour, I of course had to pay for that. In room service breakfast, they don't do that anymore. I also asked about the free glass of wine coupon I was told about in a email, I had a copy with me, they don't do that either. I paid for an upgrade to a deluxe already, so there was nothing there but I got the 15% off for only two nights not three. So what did I learn? Well the garbage dumpsters, smell all the time, they get used almost all night long and they get emptied on Sunday between 6:30 and 8:30 AM Added bonus as that it was just below a street light that was so bright you could lay in bed a get a tan. When we checked in, they told me they charged my credit card for the full stay. So what did I do? I lived what it but you do not have to. There are lots of good hotels in Rome, just do not expect much with this one. Now before everyone claims I was rude or something and thats why I got what I got. I travel a lot, I am a million mile customer with one of the airlines. Being rude gets you nothing.

I would not recommend eating in the hotel in the evening as the selection is limited and not good value when you have so many other choices near at hand (2 steaks + starter without drinks or tip were Euro 75 or US$110). The breakfast was fine since we are not into the huge american breakfast - and a couple of cappuchino's and a pastry/croissant + fruit was all we needed. Also be aware that a mixed drink (eg Gin & Tonic or Rum and Coke) were 12 Euro's each (US$17).

I had a better room rate, too, at \u20ac175. Also pleasing is that my companions and I arrived quite early in the morning from the US and after only a short wait, we were checked into our rooms. Oddly, they assigned me a fourth-floor room literally next to the restaurant dining area and across from the elevators and restrooms \u2013 possibly the worst room location in the hotel.

Not a big deal to us as it helped me justify the pizza margherita and gelato, but I would probably pick a place closer in proximity next time. The hotel staff was very friendly. The only strange occurence was when we left. We had a morning flight and as such, checked out at 6:30am. The front desk clerk called a cab for us and printed our final bill. The cab came immediately, but unfortunately when we went to open the front door, it was locked. Apparently they lock the front door at night, and the bellman with the key was nowhere to be found. He showed up after about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, that meant the cab's meter was already at 10 euros before our trip to the airport had even begun. Additionally, I find it quite alarming that if - heaven forbid - a fire or emergency should break out, the only exit is locked and only a single bellman has the key!

The room was spacious with high ceilings, the decor in the room was a little plain but clean and presentable.

The room supplied toiletries a hair dryer and a mini bar under the TV (which was not a flat screen). What I did find strange is that you were not supplied with a kettle or coffee etc. We went to the bar in the reception area to get coffee and took it back to our room which saved on room service charges of 7 euros.

We walked everywhere from here since it was all so close. At nights we'd go out to the Trastevere area for dinner and wine and then on another night we took a cab to Camp de' Fiori and had cocktails there. Later we went to a club called Bloom that was nearby and had a great time there. Great music! We spent one of the nights on the hotel's rooftop terrace where we had wine and bruschetta, which was absolutely delicious!

The staff was very friendly and gave us some great information, as well as anwering all our questions with a great attitude. The lobby is comtemporary and charming, and the rooftop terrace was quiet and relaxing. The rooms were outstanding. We had a small foyer when you stepped in with a good size bedroom with king bed to the right (and it was large by European standards) and the bathroom was straight in from the foyer, with a good size shower. The shower pressure was a bit lacking, but still a nice set-up with area to sit in the shower. To compliment everything, they hotel room even had wonderful robes and slippers for your use, as well as turn down service each evening, with the slippers placed bedside with foot toweling. The beds were excellent, and I was tempted to take off the bottom sheet to see what type of mattress it was. This was the most superior hotel I have ever stayed at in Europe, and was very impressed. When I visit Rome again, I plan to stay at this same hotel.

However, the days I was there the service was off. First, there are outside steps to get into the hotel's lobby. My husband got to carry up the luggage for five people because their doorman/bell hop was on \"break.\" Yes, they only have one, which even when he is not on break creates issues if other patrons need him. Be aware that there is an outdoor elevator to the lobby/rooms in the event that you have a disability and can't climb those stairs. However you will need that one guy to let you use that elevator, so hope he is around. Upon first entering our room, it struck me as sort of drab. This is not due to any lack of care or maintenance. Rather I realized it had to do with the finishes and decor originally chosen for the place. Lots of medium neutrals and medium woods make it look less fashionable, I guess. At over 250 euros a night (a special rate, mind you, since we stayed for three nights. Our one return night prior to flying home it was even more), one would like to be dazzled a bit, not think \"meh.\" The housekeeping was uneven. The toiletries were not complete (perhaps they ran out because it was a holiday weekend? Or a shipment did not arrive? On a return day a week later prior to flying home, suddenly there was conditioner and a nice package of facial treatments that were not produced the three earlier days.) We had a host of little issues with our rooms. Two examples. A clogged drain had to wait until Monday to be fixed--no such work possible on the weekend. A safe never closed properly. Each time the staff was alerted, but that safe never worked, for example. The front desk seemed surprised when these things were mentioned on check out, but no consideration was offered, which for the clogged drain really should have been since it made the shower unusable (the offer of a room change was made when it first happened, for the next day when rooms became available, I should mention. Rather than deal with the inconvenience of repacking and moving, the shower in another party member's room was used). My biggest complaint, however, had to do with the climate control. Although it was cool outside our first days in Rome it was also very damp and the building itself was not cool. Nor could one open the window at night without letting in the street noises. On Sunday the sun came out and things warmed up considerably, especially on the western side with the afternoon sun. I asked about air conditioning and was told the management had turned it off and it could not be turned back on with the manager gone that day. Our last day, a Monday, I was told that the manager said it was controlled by some central thermostat keyed to outdoor temperature and could not be affected, which is nonsense. My conclusion is that management decides what the patrons will have to live with according to their own reading of the weather, and too bad if it doesn't work for you. There is good news too, however. First, this hotel has some of the best soundproofing I have found in a hotel in Europe, especially an old one. The hotel was full our first night but we heard nothing from other rooms. Also, they have superior sound reduction windows so that even with a room over the street, nothing penetrated, not even those motorcycles. This is not a small matter if you are not used to city noises. The breakfast room is well managed and very pleasant. The buffet is fine, and fairly typical of hotels of this class---scrambled egg and bacon, rolls, yogurt, cereals, cold cuts and cheeses, fruits, juices, etc. They had the roof top terrace open, and it was delightful to start the day up there. One man is clearly in charge and he keeps the staff on point. The rooms are of decent size for Europe. The two bedded rooms are noticeably larger than the ones with one bed. The showers are small, but not the tiny ones you find in tourist class hotels. If you know what I am talking about, these showers are about half again wider, which makes all the difference. Still, the water source was installed on the long wall, not a short one, which was a peculiar arrangement and did not make showering easy. The showers are lined in stone which makes keeping the mold away a challenge. The really fastidious traveler might think they are not entirely winning that war, since some traces are visible, but it appeared to me that they were fighting a good fight, and in general I had no complaints about cleanliness. The bathrobes, slippers and sparkling wine and water were nice touches. The beds are VERY firm. I happen to like that, but not everyone does. The location is a bit out of the way, tucked behind the colosseum. As other comments indicate, it is a quieter neighborhood and actually quite restful after a day in the historic center. San Clemente is two blocks away, and should be visited. In theory one can walk anywhwere from this location (we walked from Piazza Navone home one day without killing ourselves) but you can easily take a cab too. Cab fare mid day from the hotel to the Vatican museums, about as far as most tourists would go, costs around 10-12 euros depending on traffic and route. Many cabs will NOT pick up if you hail, so learn where the cab stands are if you intend to use them. And bring the phone number with you too. I phoned for a cab when we emerged from San Pietro in Vincoli and one came in three minutes. It pays to orient yourself with a map while in Rome, because there are cab drivers who will take you for a ride if they think you won't know the difference. This is one of those hotels where what you pay probably affects your opinion. I expected very good things based on Tripadvisor reviews, but it did not quite measure up. We paid enough that I was not inclined to overlook the flaws. The other reviewers here either had better experiences, or paid a lot less perhaps.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood as long as you're not on the ground floor in which case it's awful\u201d", "Author": "Montey_11", "ReviewID": "UR106955898", "Content": "Do not accept room 105!!!!

The collection of bags by the hotel porter was so quick my girlfriend was worried they had been knicked. Check in was quick and informative and a great map was given - there was no hard sell of trips although a leaflet was given with some trips but no pressure exerted at all. The room was compact but sufficient for us and the bed was hard which I liked. I did hear some lorry noises early in the morning but I would say that the hotel is in a quiet area. The reception staff did say that they would move us to a higher floor if we found it a problem (as I mentioned the ground floor had some mixed reviews on tripadvisor). The room was very clean, everything worked and it looked fresh. TV choice is lacking for english speaking customers (Sky News & CNN only). The negatives from my perspectives (1) the reception staff quoted me 75 euros to be collected at the airport but my research indicated that this should be a 40-50 euro fare (2) the food is expensive so we did not order anything even when we really wanted to stay in (3) the breakfast staff are quite disorganised with drinks going to the wrong tables, squabbles between staff and I was told by the usually nice young waitress that the incorrect delivery of coffee was what I asked for yet they clearly struggled to remember what orders they had taken (minor issue but irritating all the same to be told that the waitress knows better about what I would like than I do myself).

Reception staff friendly and welcoming. One of the guys insisted on giving me an apple and some candy each day, which was sweet. He'd say something in Italian to me, I had no idea what it was - it sounded friendly so I just said thank you and smiled. Room: A very nice average size room, not big or small. Flat screen TV with CNN (a must for me is some news channel in English). It was winter so the heating was on point, nice and cozy room. The gown and slippers were a nice touch although I'll be honest both gowns in the room had seen better days and could use a fabric softener... Cleanliness: I know for a fact that the bed sheets were not changed for my entire stay. That was 4 days or so. I had slightly soiled one sheet (yes, Im a woman so that happens sometimes) so I took it off to wash the stain. That was achieved. However, when I came back at night, the same sheet was in the bed - damp on one side. So i slept on the other side, no issues. I was scared they'd make me pay a fortune if I complained about changing sheets. Their beds are big enough. But that sheet was on my bed till I left. Well I guess that was punishment from the hotel gods for my bad bad behaviour :)... But I washed it. Breakfast: I totally loved it. The waitresses were very friendly, the room was nice and cozy.

Check in was good - staff friendly and gave us lots of information, maps and ideas of places to go. You can book tours with them at reception too - we did not as it was not our first time in Rome and had already done the local hop on hop off bus tour. In fairness Rome is not a big city so you really can get everywhere on foot and its more enjoyable that way too - when you get tired you can stop off at any of the lovely piazza's and have an over priced and tiny coffee :-) Rooms in hotel are quite big compared to most european hotel rooms - was impressed with that. its true to say that with noise level and all you should try to get a room high up if you are a light sleeper as you will hear trucks in the morning and bottle collections. Rooms cleaned daily and all common areas very well maintained. The one thing about this hotel is that it does not have a restaurant - this is not a big thing as there are just loads of restaurants around the area to suit all pockets. It does however serve breakfast up on the roof terrace which is very nice - its mainly coffee's baked good, cheese's, fruit and some scrambled eggs - its really was more than I expected we would get so was happy. Staff in the breakfast room are also very welcoming and friendly. They also have a room service menu available but in my opinion a little overpriced that not really worth it and is nice to eat out than in your room anyway. We found a little gem of a restaurant that we ate in all nights (boring as that may sound you will understand why when you visit it). It is all Nau Machia and its just up the street to the right and the food is cheap and cheerful and just so yummy. We had asked for a recommendation for our final night - wanted to try something different the reception recommended a place called \"3\" or something like that - again just up the road from the hotel.

We maybe our excuses and vacated the premises - rushing back to your old favourite if they would have us and sorry that we ever deserted them. Check out fine - you are hit with the Rome tax on departure so be aware of that - \u20ac6 a night tourist tax for visiting their city.......... here in Ireland they are just glad ya came and would not think of charging you - but in saying that we dont have a lot of ancient sights that needs perserving so we paid and went on our way.

Its location is perfect for all the key sights and quiet enough (apart from the ubiquitous Vespas!) to be properly relaxing at the end of the day. It is surrounded by a number of good quality eating places from the cheap(ish!) to the expensive, so take your pick. The hotel appears to have been refurbished not too long ago and the interior is quite stylish, but not 'over the top'. No complaints about the spacious room (ours was a double deluxe) apart from the same one everyone has in Italy about there being no tea or coffee making facilities. The buffet breakfast was, on the whole, average to good in terms of quality. The choices did not vary in the three nights we were there, so did get a little repetitive. The front desk staff - particularly Massimo, the duty manager - were very helpful and were clearly proud to welcome you to their city. Only down side was that there was no restaurant service in the hotel in the evenings - so you had to go out to eat - which is not good for such an otherwise good quality establishment.

If you've travelled to the big cities in Europe like we have, you are always looking for a hotel room that doesn't cost a fortune, is near places you want to see, and is bigger than a walk-in closet. Capo d'Africa is such a place. After exhaustive research, we decided to take a chance on this hotel having only seen the pictures on their website. We weren't disappointed. The rooms are spacious for the price. They are quiet, even the ones facing the street, the bathrooms are ample so you are not bumping into each other, and the location was just fine - especially if you like to walk. The hotel is just 3 blocks or so from the Colluseum, so that is a good first stop. No, it is not near the Spanish Steps and the Via Veneto, but you can always take a taxi there and walk around with the crowds. We actually walked from the Colluseum, to the Forum, to the Capitoline Hill, to the Pantheon and were ready for lunch. The hotel offers a big breakfast and your favorite coffee drink on the rooftop at shaded tables. One of our favorite restaurants, including the very expensive ones we sampled, was Il Bocconcino, just down the street from Capo d'Africa. The food was delicious and the prices very reasonable - probably because few tourists dine there. Finally, the staff was most helpful with getting taxis, making restaurant reservations and available for general questions and concerns (our air conditioner pooped out for a short time.

It looks impressive from the outside and has a contemporary lobby. The reception staff were not particularly friendly, we were not welcomed on arrival and we were often ignored as we came in and out. However, one receptionist was very helpful and arranged for us to have a two hour late check-out at no extra charge. We were originally shown to a room on the first floor next to the lift and the lobby and knew it would be noisy and asked for a different one. We were immediately shown to a room on the fourth floor which had more basic decor but was quiet apart from the staff using the store room next door who banged the walls every time they were in it. The hotel has the potential to live up to it's four star rating but doesn't quite manage it - it doesn't pay attention to the details. For example - the clothes rail in the wardrobe goes from front to back - you have to put your clothes behind each other which makes them difficult to get to and you can't fit many in. The other half of the wardrobe has no rail so it is a wasted space. The toilet roll holder was not screwed together so every time you use it it comes off the wall and falls apart! The air conditioning didn't really work but you can't leave the windows open instead as they are weighted to close themselves - you can't even prop them open with a chair as the backs are too low! A a previous reviewer stated - there are no spy holes or security chains on the doors which is disconcerting. The roof terrace is lovely and we enjoyed an afternoon reading there although it was spoilt buy the smell of dead rodent which kept drifting across! On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the maids did a good job. The breakfast staff were friendly and you can eat as late as 11.00am.

We went from Thurs to Mon, so we had 3 full days really. We booked through Expedia - ended up on Thomas Cook's page our flights were with Brussels airlines outbound and Lufthansia inbound. We booked the transfers from the airport fiumicino to the hotel and from the hotel to the airport through thomas cook at the same time, on arriving at fiumicino you enter the arrivals after collecting your baggage - expedia is the yellow desk next to the blue desk, the driver will be stood here. We stayed at the Capo D'Africa on B&B basis, the hotel is gorgeous, we got an upgrade to a junior suite upon arrival. All the staff were extremely helpful, its actually the best service we have ever had. TOP TIPS: Water on tap - I reccommend you buy a bottle of water, then fill it up for free from one of the many water fountains (not the trevi fountain) but these water fountains are all over rome and especially in the main sites except the colosseum - we never came across one in there. The bread they bring you before your evening meal is NOT always included - check on this as sometimes it can be an unexpected cost from 1 Euro to 5 Euro's. Safety - I read lots about pick pockets - and was especially worried about us falling victim's. I think that because i was so aware of it, it made me more conscious of people, so my tip especially if your travelling with someone else is to keep an eye on your surroundings, if anyone gets too close pull your fellow traveller away from the situation and i would mention to my husband when ever someone got too close, the word pockets, to which he would put his hands in his pockets straight away. Anyway we never saw anyone and never got pick pocketed. Travel - Everything is within walking distance, the map looks big, but you can walk around very easily and if you catch buses and other transport you may miss some of the beautiful sites. If you want to go to the Vatican gardens - you need to pre book this before you go, allow plenty of time before travelling. Download Rick Steve's free audio guide Gladiator's - There are many gladiators walking around the main attractions - they want you to take a photo of them and you then they want you to pay for it. If you want to do this then agree a price beforehand - a few Euro's is more than enough. Street beggers - now this is a common problem all over the world in major cities and rome is no different, They lie face down on the floor with their hands out and look old and fragile, don't always be fooled - i saw a few who had exceptionally young looking hands for the portrayal of an elderly fragile lady !!! hmmm upto you. Drink plenty of water and rest in the shade - it's very hot in the sun looking at sites. RESTAURANTS: These are places i am reccommending: Pasqualino al Colosseo, this is on Via SS. Quattro, one street down from the hotel and to the right (they charge for bread 4 Euro's) Ricevuta Fiscale O Fattura? i think this is the name, but it is on the road marked Via Baccina, south east (as you look at the map) of the Colonna Traiana or left of the site S. Pietro in Vincoli - They don't charge for bread and have set menu's we had the roast chicken with fries and salad. HOTEL: I had done a lot of research into this trip before we left, and found this hotel, it is everything we wanted, and i have high standards, and wouldn't stay in any hotel below a 4 star. Breakfast - The roof terrace is beautiful, breakfast is served from 6.30am until 11am, the staff were attentive and proficient in keeping the area clean and refreshed with food and drinks, the breakfast consisted of fresh juices, water, breads, cereals, croissants and other pastries, cakes, yoghurts and yoghurt drinks, fresh fruit, nuts, crackers, jams, honey and chocolate spread, mozzarella balls and tomoatoes... the hot bits were small sausages and scrambled eggs, pots of tea and cups of coffee. Plenty of choice really. TV - The TV has only three english speaking channels, and two were news, not a problem for us as we were hardly in our room. Has and has not - There was no iron or ironing board but would assume you could request one from reception, there was also no tea / coffee making facilities, but we took our travel kettle. However there is a hairdryer - not very fast but dried my long hair with a little patience. There is a small fridge filled as a mini bar - which we used to put our bottles of water in. The rooms were kept very clean and tidy, we had a turn down service each night, and our room had red slippers and white robes There is a fully equiped gym that is air conditioned with fresh towels, we didn't use it but we did go and have a look. The location of the hotel is perfect, we felt safe and there was no noise at night, Everything is within walking distance and i have a knee injury, plus the restaurants in the area are wonderful. PRICE LIST: Vatican City and Sistine Chapel = 15 Euro per person Cupola = 5 Euro stairs / 7 Euro lift per person Castel Sant' Angelo = 8.50 Euro per person Colosseum / Roman Forum / Palatine Hill = 18 Euro per person (Lasts 2 days) Metro = 1 Euro valid for one way per person Tour Bus = 20 Euro for 24 hours / 25 Euro for 48 hours (Hop on hop off) per person St. Peter's Bascilia and Square = Free The Roman Pantheon = Free The Spanish steps = Free (Very crowded) The Trevi Fountain = Free (very crowded) Arco di Constantino = Free Area Sacra = Free (under excavation) Circo Massimo = (under excavation) SITES: St. Peter's Bascilia and Vatican City :- We visited St. Peter's Bascilia and the Vatican City on our first day, we caught the metro and headed towards Battistini,we caught this at Manzoni station (Line A), but you can catch it from Colosseo (Line B) which is marked on the map behind the colosseum, then change at Termini, and you get off at Ottaviano. It costs 1 Euro per person each way, but won't give change higher than from a 5 Euro note. It lasts 75 mins from purchase, and the journey is fast and reliable. Then it's a short walk to Vatican city where at this point you will get asked if you want a tour by numerous people, either ignore them and do not engage in conversation or if you want a tour - ask how much. We did not queue for the vatican at all, even though the tour guides were saying there was a 2 hour wait..... We had downloaded the Rick steve's audio guide from itunes which is free and has many tours for Rome, i would reccommend you buy his book as well, but we just used the audio, You really need to start at vatican city then you go through the vatican to the sistine chapel (Don't sit on the steps, don't speak or take pictures - this is a sacred area) - the cafe is not very good for food in the vatican in my opinion. From there you can go to the Cupola which is the highest dome at St. Peter's it costs 7 Euro for the lift and 5 Euro for the stairs - either way you still have to walk up 320 steps to get to the very top and see the wonderful panoramic view of Rome - Don't worry if you cannot make it up here though (see Castel Sant' Angelo) After the Cupola you end up in St. Peter's bascilia, this church has buried in the main tomb the body of st. Peter, worth a visit even for non believers, like my husband. The magnitude of the place is awe inspiring. From here you enter down the steps to the square, the vatican has it's own postal service, and you may want to use the post boxes here for your post cards, they are in the square as you exit the bascilia on the right hand side. Colosseum:- The main attraction we wanted to see, with such history and splendour, it is a wonderful site to visit. It has been used as many things in it's past from the arena it's well known for to a refuge, a church, and a place for the homeless, until it was brought back to life and partially restored. Sit down and imagine life back in roman times, in this site used to be a man made lake owned by Nero before the colosseum was built. You cannot wander through the floor arena, but you can use your imagination. Lots to read about as you walk around this colossal building that has withstood many earthquakes in it's lifetime. The Roman Forum / Palatine Hill:- This is a very big site to visit - The forum has an abundance of archeological finds, you may wish to purchase the audio guide for this and share between 2, take your own ear phones and plug them into the device - it costs 6 Euro per device for 3 hours, (you need to leave a credit card or driving document, just to ensure you return it - it's safe). The area is very uneven and hilly with lots of steps to climb, but as long as you keep resting it is something you can do. You get to climb to the top of palatine hill and see the beautiful gardens, (this is all connected - so can be a long day but upto you) Castel Sant' Angelo:- I wanted to visit this because i love castle's and love the statues that adorn the bridge as you enter named Ponte Sant' Angelo. The castle is strange - not particularly pretty from the outside and a little unusual from the inside - there is no audio guide, so take a real tour guide or buy a book to make sense - or walk around and enjoy the architecture and make your own story up about the castle. The views over the city from the top are just as good as from the cupola at St. Peter's Bascilia. The on site restaurant is very expensive and takes a long time to get served if you want to sit outside. The Roman Pantheon:- You need to take a step back to fully appreciate this, there is a McDonalds opposite, go to this point and you will see the dome of the Pantheon, when you step inside take a look at the height of the doors and then draw your eyes to the ceiling - it's open and the sun shines straight through, many people are buried here such as Raphael the architect / painter. Piazza Navona:- A very famous piazza, the square has three fountains which are beautiful, and lots of painters who are selling oil painting - if your thinking or buying a painting think about how your going to get it home? you need a tube for it really. But the paintings are outstanding - they look so real, there is some real talent from these people. We didn't stop for a drink, but would of if we had more time. The Spanish Steps:- We walked here and sat on the steps and took in the atmosphere of the area, it is a truly designer street - with all the major fashio designers in the area. You can take the metro from the hotel from colosseo Line B - connect at Termini onto Line A and get off at Spagna - which is Spanish steps. This line is also great for the Trevi fountain, but you can walk to it within a few mintes from the spanish steps. The Trevi Fountain:- We had to go here as it's a must do item. go and throw your coin into the fountain which is supposed to ensure your return to the eternal city in the future, photographers ask if you want a polaroid of you at the fountain - again upto you, we didn't, we thought they were a little pushy. Stay stern if you don't want things but be polite. Well that is about it really, i hope this helps people who are planning trips to Rome, I found our little bits and pieces but would have loved to have known more - all in one place - this has taken some time to write - but if you have any enquiries, i am more than happy to help if i can.

The hotel is convenient for visiting the remains of ancient Rome which are 5-10 minutes walk away,,but the centre in terms of restaurants, shopping and other sights is about 20-30 minutes walk or a 10 minute walk and a metro journey. We couldnt work out the buses. As the hotel is in a residential area, the restaurants immediately surrounding it are authentically Italian and the ones we used were good but simple.

A really attractive property in a quiet side street, literally a few minutes walk from the Colosseum.

The hotel is clean, the staff are excellent, the rooms are spacious and the free buffet breakfast on the roof terrace is plentiful and varied. There is no restaurant, but why would you want to eat in the hotel when you are in Rome? As a general guideline, avoid the local restaurants around the hotel for the evening and take a taxi (euro10) to somewhere like Piazza Navona or Trastevere. During the day, there is much to see within walking distance and if you have to go to Ferragamo, walk there from the Pantheon via the Trevi Fountain. One negative, and for many not a small one, there is no free internet! You can pay an outrageous price for a wifi connection in the lobby, or a somewhat lesser fee for a connection through the room TV. Don't even bother with the latter, its almost impossible to read the average webpage on a non-HD screen. Oh, and heres a BIG tip.

Once in Rome, we found a lot of other wonderful accommodation options in better locations for less which we wished we had booked. While the hotel is not good value for money, I would not write a bad review except for what happened next...On the only occasion I forgot to lock the safe, 700 euro was stolen by a member of staff. This happened while our room was serviced. Even the hotel staff admitted to us the theft was by a staff member. Given the circumstances I would assume the Hotel would reimburse us. We followed all of their instructions and made a police report in Rome immediately. We were asked to wait while they resolved this through insurance. .We waited very patiently for over 3 months. The hotel failed to keep us updated unless we chased them. Finally they advise us that we can have a few nights free accommodation only. They know we live in Australia & can't use this which we made very clear to them. I have even checked with the Italian consumer body & the hotel is required under Italian law to reimburse us, however they will not negotiate any further on this.

Firstly let me say that the staff in this hotel are amazing, the friendliest we have encountered. The porters, the receptionists, the maids and the breakfast staff were all lovely and very helpful we had no problems whatsoever. We stayed in room 314, it was exactly as depicted in their photographs. The bathroom is excellent, very good shower, very powerful (and also for all you ladies out there it is a shower that comes off the wall so you can bring it down to wash with which is much better than the ones fixed in the walls ;-) ). The bed is absolutely huge and made to perfection every day by the maid. They had a TV in the room with approximately 9 channels, one of which was Sky News so whilst getting ready for days out we could catch up on what was happening in the World. Breakfast was served until 11:30am which is great as some hotels stop at about 10:00am. There were lots of breakfast staff on hand who sit you straight away and ask if you want tea, coffee, cappuchino etc. Great selection of cakes!! If it is warm enough you can sit outside on the roof terrace at breakfast which we did twice, the second time we had a table with a view of the Colloseum. There is an excellent safe in the rooms whereby you can set a new PIN code every time you use it so there is no way the staff can know your code. There are 4 floors in this hotel (I think a basement too) and a very efficient lift (elevator) if you are like me and want to save your legs for the Palatine. The overall presentation of this hotel is excellent and vey clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel. We loved it. Great location for Ancient Rome. Very very small negative points (almost not worth mentioning) the beds are firm which is great but verging on the 'too hard' side.

It was very centrally located - about 5 min or so walk from the colosseum and very accessible to all of Rome's other main attractions. The hotel was clean and tidy and the staff were very good. There was a mixture of guests in terms of nationality and ages. The restaurant was on the top floor and had a roof terrace where you could have breakfast if the weather was warm enough. You even had a view of the colosseum from there. The breakfast was probably one of the best we've had on a city break - catering for all tastes including Kellogs miniature boxes of cereal! When you arrive in Rome we were approached by a private taxi driver who offered to take us and a few others direct to our hotels for Euro 15 per person. We didn't know whether it was a fair deal or not but having just arrived and not knowing where to go we decided to go with him. On the return to the airport the hotel offered to arrange a taxi for us for Euro 40 for us both but we walked to the main station (about 25 min walk) and got the train direct to the airport for Euro 15 each. We did find out that you could get an open return bus ticket from the airport to the city centre for Euro 11 each but we never did find out where the bus station was and therefore how far it was from the hotel. The hotel reception staff were very helpful and organised our pre-booked tickets for the Vatican museums and St Peter's Basilica - well worth doing for the Euro2 each commission we paid. If you don't pre-book you have to queue outside the Vatican walls to get tickets. We have done the Vatican twice and in September we queued for probably 2 hours plus and on this trip we reckon the queue was about 1.5 to 2 hours again. If you have pre-booked tickets you go round to the museum entrance and queue for about 20 mins. We had a timed slot of 12noon but were 30 mins early but still got in OK. There is a lot to see in the museums, the contents of which are phenominal, including, of course, the Sistene Chapel which is worth the long walk. There is a lovely cafe which surprisingly was reasonably priced and seemed to do a variety of food although we had already bought paninis from a panini bar just opposite the Vatican. Italy is the home of great cuisine and there is no shortage of eateries of all price ranges. We went to one called Naumachie (turn right outside of hotel and first right and it's down on the left hand side on the corner) again recommended by the same friend. It was excellent. Very good food and reasonably priced although not a huge selection. We did try the Royal Art Cafe Hotel restaurant just opposite the colosseum but it was pricey and no better than Naumachie really.

We used it to go the Vatican museums as well as heading over to the Spanish Steps- a good starting point if you want to go see the Trevi Fountain, Pantheon and Piazza Navona. The rooms are nicely done- modern clean lines and the bathrooms are clean too. We had a bathroom with a window and it was very spacious. Our friends on the other hand had an internal bathroom and it was a little cramped I think. Breakfast is served on the top floor in a bright room with two terraces off it. The choice for breakfast was more limited than I would have expected for a four star hotel but it was adequate. the staff serving were all very friendly too. There were two things about our room that I found annoying. It was sweltering in Rome in late May- 32-34 Degrees C- so air-conditioning was very necessary for sleeping comfortably. We both thought our room was quite warm even though we had the air on full-blast. We reported it to the reception but we were told that the aircon was centrally controlled so it was working correctly. After the second night we went to reception again and they agreed to send someone up to check our sir-con. When the guy arrived he took one feel of the airflow and stated that it was broken. When we returned that evening, there was a man fixing the main unit in the wall outside our room. Later when we checked the aircon, it was very cold- perfect for a warm night. It was annoying though how the receptionist didnt check it straight away as we slept badly both nights without the air-con. Secondly the shower pressure was very low so it took a whikle to shower properly. Also the water would alternate between hot and cold which i thought was strange. My friends on the second floor said their shower was working fine so maybe it was our room or our floor. Overall this hotel was very nice but it was expensive at \u20ac250 per night-and that was a special internet deal- so you would expect things like air-conditioning and showers to work well.

It's all a very rare find in Rome, even at the four star level. The whole hotel looked like it had been fairly recently remodeled; our rooms had modern furniture and fixtures, and the bathrooms were refreshingly updated. The staff was also very nice (Sergio was best!); they made a lot of our reservations for us, provided us with maps and car service, and were just generally on point, which is not something I can say is common for southern Italy. Also, there were two rooftop decks that were a nice touch; we sat on the deck overlooking the Colosseum every morning for breakfast. My only warning to travelers about this hotel is that it is not in a central location. It is about a 5 minute walk from the Colosseum, on the southern side of the heart of the city. That being said, I am a fairly lazy person and I didn't mind the location. I thought for how nice the hotel was, it was worth it. It's not a very long walk to any of the sites, shopping or restaurants (you could always take the Metro or a bus, both of which can be picked up in front of the Colosseum). I think our longest walk was 40 minutes to the Vatican, which is significantly west of the city. It was about 20 minutes to the Trevi Fountain/Spanish Step area, and we ate dinner there most nights and then strolled back to the hotel.

Once, I inquired the name of the medieval church that can be seen from the roof top terrace and the manager happened to be in the Lobby at the time. He was amazingly knowledgeable and gave us a short history of that church and of the churches in Rome in general. Everyone was very helpful, even willing to open the breakfast room a bit earlier to accomodate an earlier tour departure. The roof top terrace was a perfect place to end our busy days. We'd get a drink in the Lobby, or bottled water, bought elsewhere, and we'd go up there and recap our day. The potted plants in the terrace were so evocative of the region with their fruit-laden olive and lemon trees, it was truly a pleasure sitting up there. My only complaint is with the bathtub in our room. Instead of a flat tub floor, it was curved and very slippery. When we arrived home we had several bruises on our thighs and legs. Eventually, we solved the problem by laying a towel inside the tub, because the rubber mat they had there didn't work very well. Otherwise, the bathroom was very nicely appointed.

My fiance and I were aware that we could make a reservation at the Vatican to avoid the long line, and when we asked the concierge to help us with this, he told us that he could only help us to schedule a tour with a certain tour group, but not to make a reservation for us to tour on our own.

Additionally, the same staff member referred to a very disappointing restaurant in the area (seriously sub-par food, and we're not picky eaters!) and when we arrived at the restaurant we could see that the only other diners there were also staying at our hotel, which made us think that there was some little payola scheme in effect. Upon our checkout, we discovered we had been charged 2x as much for our internet purchase as we should have been... fortunately we had retained our internet card and had \"proof\" that we had been overcharged for the internet time we had purchased. And last but not least, the lovely roof top terrace/patio that is featured on the internet, was not lit/ usable at nightime, nor does it have a view of the Colosseum, nor is food served there.

The Reception - When we have arrived to the hotel we reception was quick, pleasant and included a review form Massimo about all the places we need to see during our stay with explanation and a map. As i told Massimo, it was the best reception i had ever. 3. The Lobby - is modernly and well decorated with warm and welcoming colors. 4. The Room - bigger than most hotels rooms in Rome, very clean, fairly accessorized, although the bed is big the mattress was not the most comfortable i have ever slept on,, but i wasn't something that kept me awake at night. The bathroom was very clean and comfortable. The room hold good size closets and a safe which are very handy, you will find robes and sleepers as well. The minibar is well equipped although i rarely use them in any of the hotels i stay. One thing about the room i couldn't figure out is how to set the air condition to a comfortable temperature. 5. The Service - We have always received a great, professional, prompt service. 6. The Breakfast - one thing which is a bit disappointing is the breakfast. The main thing the breakfast lacks in is choice. The are no vegetables but tomatoes, the is a choice of serials, cheese, not to much fruits, dairy, bread, cakes, juices and coffee. All in all, i would surely return to the this hotel next time I'm in Rome.

Even though we were close to everything, we were on a quiet side street and were able to sleep peacefully. There were plenty of little restaurants around the hotel and we ate at most of them during our stay. Our trip to Rome was great, especially since we were there off-season.

We actually didn't need the help, but to not offer was a tad unprofessional. The room was ok, but a bit small. If you're tall and have a basic room, prepare to take a shower sideways, as the tub is narrow. No one goes to Rome to watch TV, but the channel selection wasn't great. Not what you'd expect from a place that charges well over \u00a3100 a night. No hot items at breakfast, and at one point later during our stay, an employee walked straight into our room without knocking! She had the nerve to actually ask if we used the minibar rather than simply apologizing and shutting the door. How ridiculous. Another time at the front desk, when asking about a restaurant, the receptionist answered the phone, which is no problem. When she was done, though, she spent about 15 seconds chatting to friends who were leaving the hotel before coming back to me. Again, it may sound silly, but I don't think that's great customer service. Perhaps staff should consult Locanda Orseolo in Venice for service.

We stayed here for one week at the end of July/early August having booked based on reviews mainly on this site. We took a train and metro from the airport because i'd been to Rome before and thought i had a good idea of where the hotel was, but after stepping off the metro at the Collusseum and walking around in intense heat trailing suitcases for almost an hour we finally gave in and jumped in a taxi. Five minutes later (and only a few steps from the circle we had walked around in) we arrived to the beautiful facade of Capo d'Africa. A porter met us and carried our cases up the steps and after check-in up to our room. The front desk staff were polite and helpful. Our room was a delux twin (i was with my mother) and was a pretty good size. It was clean and well stocked and the porter showed us where things were and how they worked. We had the room directly over the front entrance and seemed to have the only room which had a balcony (except for the room on the roof with it's own terrce) which was lovely to stand out on and enjoy the sun sometimes. The hotel is modern and light and airy, the room was nice and the beds actually comfortable after long days of walking around the city. There is a panel outside the room showing staff whether or not you are inside which meant that we were NEVER worried about being in the room when cleaners needed in or being disturbed in any way. This was great and i must say that it seemed as if there were elves who came in and cleaned when we weren't around because every time we left the room (even if only for breakfast) something was done without us knowing! Windows would be opened during the day for air and closed later in the evening before bed, a mat and slippers and our pyjamas laid out for us for bed, fresh toiletries during the day if we had run out of something! It was a nice touch and something more hotels should offer. Breakfast was fine. Served in a lovely room with an outside terrace either side if you could stand the heat. A nice selection of food-fresh fruit salad, cereals, breads, meat, cheese and pastries etc, or hot food if you wanted at an extra cost. The lady who seemed to run the place was lovely and greeted us every morning, remembering our room number and tea for two! There was also a roof terrace which was a lovely place to have a glass of prossecco in the evening before heading out for dinner. You just use the phone to ring the bar and they bring up drinks and snacks. In the dark, candles lit all around make it really cosy. The hotel serves food either in the bar (at reception-lovely and cool and modern), on the terrace or in your room. We had lunch when we arrived and it was okay, although not what i would have expected for such a nice place. But that doesn't matter because the very best thing about this hotel is it's proximity to really good local places to eat. Le Naumachie, down the street and to the right is a lovely restaurant (we ate there 3 times!), it's local so full of Romans mixed with tourists, the food is great and very inexpensive (although it does go up at weekends or perhaps for the month of August but not by much) but it was the service we received which really made the experience special for us. Every customer was treated like a friend and welcomed. Much better than the touristy places in the main areas where the food is twice the price and nowhere near as good. There was also a lovely place next door called Luzzi which served great food and was really cheap and packed every night! I recommend them both! There were lots of places to eat near-by so you won't be stuck and this is great because although the hotel is great, it is a good long walk to most of the central areas in Rome and it's nice to have a break! I much preferred these local eateries. So i would definately recommend this place if you want something modern and comfortable with good service and don't mind a walk to the main sights (a taxi is only about \u20ac6/\u20ac7 to most of the main areas-we got dropped at via del corso, main st, on the nights we wanted to cut out some of the walking and walked around the Trevi fountain/ Pantheon/Spanish steps areas).

The streets around the hotel were very quiet \u2013 a joy after the noise and bedlam that is normal Rome streets. We had a reasonably sized room at the rear. The room was very clean and well appointed \u2013 although only one chair for a double room \u2013 not really a problem as we spent most of our \u201crelaxing time\u201d on the terrace. The room had a safe \u2013 always very useful. The bathroom clean and modern \u2013 plenty of toiletries, but only one bathrobe provided. We had one (small) \u201cgripe\u201d: the shower pressure is fairly low. But they did provide bathroom scales ( a first for us) which were useful in checking the weight of the cases for the return flight. Another minor gripe \u2013 they do not provide a \u201cdo not disturb\u201d sign for the room door \u2013 the maid tried to get into our room twice while we were in. The only English speaking channels on the TV were CNN and Sky News. The hotel has a roof-top terrace, where you can have a coffee or beer after a day\u2019s hectic site-seeing. Breakfast was very good \u2013 a good and varied selection of food. Any shortages were quickly replenished. It is possible to order cooked eggs (e.g. omelette, poached etc) \u2013 although this is charged at 5 Euro per portion. Breakfast can also be taken on the Terrace \u2013 an excellent start to any day. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there is a fairly large Room Service menu, which we understand can be provided in the bar area also. We did not use this service. All the staff were extremely helpful and helped us arrange various trips and tickets for museums. After having an \u201cexciting\u201d trip into Rome from the Airport in a taxi, we decided to use the Hotel Car Service for our return journey \u2013 this was much more sedate and relaxing. The car was waiting for us at check-out (no hanging around). This cost 50 Euros and was charged to the room, so there was no haggling. We felt was worth it because the first Taxi Ride was 45 Euros. Getting about Rome was easy \u2013 the Ancient City is within easy walking distance from the Hotel, and on one day we did manage to walk into the Centre and back. The Colosseo Metro Station is 10 minutes away \u2013 it costs 1 Euro for one journey. We even came back in the rush hour \u2013 very congested. There are plenty of Restaurants within easy walking distance from the hotel. Our favourites were: Caf\u00e9 Caf\u00e9 (Via SS Quattro) \u2013 Cheap and cheerful \u2013 good food. On Sunday they do a Brunch (up to 4:00pm) \u2013 all you can eat from a Buffet (Salads, Flans & open sandwiches) plus a large bottle of water and dessert all for 14 Euro. Il Bocconcino \u2013 (Via Ostilia) \u2013 Good tasty food \u2013 the menu is only in Italian, but the Waiters are helpful. Li Rioni A Santiquattro (Via SS Quattro) \u2013 right under the hotel. Turn left out of the hotel, and left again and it is at the next corner. This is a Pizzeria and the Pizzas are excellent. There is a supermarket close by (opposite Caf\u00e9 Caf\u00e9) for essential supplies (water etc). Other Comments: We would recommend the Walking Tours (Phone [-]) for the Coliseum and Vatican (Hannah Schneider). We would not recommend the Archeobus \u2013 the commentary was poor and did not relate to the location of the bus. The bus moved too quickly past the sites and the map of the bus stops provided was not useful at all \u2013 it showed bus-stops that were not used.

The hotel provide you with an excellent map and marked on all the major sites. The map proved invaluable - especially as our expensive pre-purchased pop out map broke within hours or reaching Rome! The hotel looks fantastic from the outside and is very modern and clean inside. Our room and bathroom were small but more than adequate.

The room had a very comfortable large bed, t.v, hairdryer, mini-bar etc. They provide an evening maid service where they come and put out a liitle mat and slippers by the side of you bed (I loved this!)

There are plenty of restaurants in the local area. We chose to eat at LE NAUMACHIE for two of the nights as other reviewers had mentioned it. We thought it was very nice and both the service and food were lovely. One downside is the fact that the menu is quite small and limited. On both nights it was full - they do have additional seating downstairs and at the back. Location: Turn right out of hotel and then take the first right and it is on the left hand side on the corner. For our last night we ate at the cafe/bar directly opposite the above. It seemed to be mainly used by locals. The food was OK but maybe not as posh as Le Naumachie. Breakfast in the hotel is very good. We would suggest that you go for breakfast early as staff do seem to struggle when it is busy. A continental breakfast is served. A choice of drinks are offered. You can eat on the terraces if it is warm enough. From the breakfast terrace on your right hand side you can see the colloseum.

We paid between 8 and 14 Euro for the same trips! 4. There are some good local trattorias and some BAD ones - the manager of the hotel gave us to recommendations - one of which was very good (Crab for seafood) and the other was very bad! 5.

We had the room with the balcony at the front of the hotel, but the rain prevented our using it. Of particular note, as others had commented, is the breakfast, which was always fresh, with the loveliest staff you're likely to meet anywhere, who were attentive and charming. Although the hotel doesn't do evening meals, as such, it does do room service with very nice salads (and enough bread to open a shop). This was cheaper than eating out! Good restaurants are close and there's a wine shop at the end of the street with wonderful biscuits and pasta to bring home. At the other end of the street, right by the hotel, is SS Quattro Coronati: this is quite a remarkable fourth-century church with wonderful frescoes in an external chapel. Up the road are S Stephano Rotundo--with a breath-taking interior--and the beautiful S Maria in Dominica. There are a couple of things I'd criticise about the hotel: i) we had a double room, but it only had one easy chair (why?!); ii) you have to pay a substantial amount for internet connection, which I think is rather shoddy considering the price of the hotel room; iii) the television is free if you're happy watching only CNN or Sky News (for a week...!).

The hotel is very expensive because of its location to the Colosseum, and this seems to give them the right to skimp on other amenities. The room, breakfast, room amenities, and services were nothing more than what I would expect from a Holiday Inn hotel. The most frustrating thing we experienced, however, was the customer service. No one at the hotel seems to have their story straight. My luggage was lost by our airline, and the hotel continued to tell us the luggage would be there in 24 hours. Indeed, this is what the airline was telling them, but it wasn't until we decided to speak to a manager after three days of my luggage missing that this was very common for Alitalia to lose luggage and not tell the truth on the phone. This would have been helpful information earlier. In addition, we needed to mail packages back to the U.S. We were told multiple stories about FedEx's hours and services. After being told FedEx was open on the weekend and then finding out they weren't, we went back to the original concierge to tell him his information was wrong, and he denied ever speaking to us about it. When we were getting directions to FedEx Monday morning, we told the receptionist we were in a hurry because we thought they were open on the weekend, she told us she didn't believe us that anyone in the hotel told us that. We tried to tell her someone did, and she wouldn't even listen to us. She continued to tell us she didn't believe us. It was so frustrating. We also felt the hotel was trying to scam us in many ways.

Service was excellent. The hotel was all that was expected from previous reviews. The breakfast room was lovely:-on the roof and even in February we were able to sit outside in the sun. A previous traveller had mentioned the nearby supermarket which was great for bread, cheeses and alcohol if you wanted. It was surprisingly cheap. We had booked a \"viator\" tour to the catacombs and crypts of underground Rome. This was excellent and the tour finished just around the corner from the hotel at a church called the Basilica of San Clemente. Fascinating. We would not have noticed this church or even have gone in if we had not been on the tour. The church had crypts that went back to 1AD and there was so much to see. It was also convenient to be able to walk about 50 metres back to our hotel when the tour ended. The hotel was about 2 blocks from the Colloseum and Forum. Tours of the Forum were free with English speaking guides. Well worth a visit. There were a number of nearby restaurants to eat at night. The hotel was on a one way street and was quiet in the nights. Breakfast was available until 11 o, clock. The situation was ideal for us on this visit and the staff were very helpful.The hotel map of Rome that we were given was all that we needed to find our way around. It is very easy to walk to most of the major sites in Rome but if you want to take the bus, all journeys cost just 1 Euro. Buses run very regularly.

We wanted some luxury to enjoy our 2 nights in Rome and we sure got it.....! OK, firstly (as others have pointed out) if you want an old-school Italian pensione or quaint little hotel run by mama & papa, this is not for you. Capo d'Africa is a very modern, classy and stylish hotel with every amenity at your fingertips. From the wonderfully helpful staff - they could not do enough for you, and always with a smile - to the fabulous breakfasts out on the terrace looking over the Roman rooftops to the Colosseum (all a little surreal!), to our beautifully appointed room with a view, it was all fantastic. As it turned out, I had been very clever booking about 5 months before we got there (this was the first hotel of our honeymoon that I booked!) as we ended up with a great price - E180 for a fabulous Deluxe Double Room!! When I checked their website closer to our departure the rates had increased significantly for the same period, so my suggestion is \"book well in advance\". The location of the hotel is (as you would know) right near the Colosseum. Those of you who have been to Rome before (as we have) and have done the ancient ruins etc, you will know this approximate location. It's not a sensational part of town, but it is worth it for the hotel alone. Besides, it's lovely to start each day walking past such a magnificent piece of history! And the main thing is, at night it's beautifully quiet and you get the BEST night's sleep on the incredibly comfy KS beds at d'Africa! It's also on the right side of town for a quick getaway to the airport upon your departure.... We managed to walk to a multitude of sites from the hotel - Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps etc. We do love walking but even we were over it each night when we got back to our room with filthy and throbbing feet!!! But it's so gorgeous to roam the streets of Rome (haha!) we just couldn't help ourselves. It was worth the sore tootsies. We took the train to the Vatican the following morning, which was a fabulous idea, and worked our way back from there during the day. There are some great restaurants and trattorias in the laneways around the Pantheon - too many to choose from actually - and we enjoyed a fabulous al fresco lunch there (can't recall the name of the cafe unfortunately). As mentioned in other reviews, a great restaurant near the hotel (if you can't be bothered walking any more - that was us by the end of day 2!) is definitely Ristorante Papagio. Amazing pasta and a lovely outdoor dinner setting. After a day of walking those cobblestone streets and dusty trails through the ruins, nothing beat getting back to the hotel and sitting up on the terrace sipping on one of their many delicious cocktails. You just call the bar from the rooftop phone and place your order, and soon you've got a little snack and some fabulous drinks arriving on your table as you watch the sun sinking over Rome. Pretty spectacular..... So would I stay at Capo d'Africa again?

This reminded me of a Hampton Inn (a nice new Hampton Inn) in the States. Nice looking, but not a Roman retreat. The hotel could be anywhere in the world. The bathroom was small; it had a small shower. The room was very large even for US standards. The front desk was only somewhat knowledgeable. We asked about the opera and the woman said she would look in to it. We went to our room with the bell hop and went back downstairs; she left for a break and never got back to us. We were told when we checked in that they would be glad to arrange for us to have a car take us to the airport. We were warned that we could take a cab, but warned that we risked extra charges because of our bags. While I know anything is possible, the rate to the airport by taxi is posted everywhere and cab drivers are not permitted to charge extra for bags. While we did take the car service, I don\u2019t need to be scared into doing it. The bar is in the lobby and offered a decent snack. But the bar was not anything worth making a point to stop at as there was no \u201cscene\u201d or atmosphere. The location is in a residential location, while it is near the Colosseum, it is several blocks away. The streets were deserted at night. We walked outside to look around and see what restaurants were nearby. We decided to go up by the Spanish Steps to spend our last night at a restaurant we loved. The area around the Colosseum clears out after the Colosseum closes. So catching a cab was problematic and we waited by the Colosseum for about fifteen minutes. If you are in Rome for a few days, I would not recommend staying at this hotel. The Colosseum was further than two blocks as the hotel describes itself. Yes, there is a view of the Colosseum. You have to go out to the roof and crane your head to see it. You do have a view during the breakfast buffet. We did have a bite at the breakfast buffet. Reminded me of the Hampton Inn that my parents stay at when they visit us in New Jersey. If you want the type of thing that you can get in the states, you might like this hotel.

All things being essentially equal I booked at the Capo D\u2019Africa because of it\u2019s proximity to many sights and room availability. I was very glad I made this selection. Location: I can not stress the value of this great location. It is on a quiet street about 3-4 blocks from the Colosseum, Forum and Metro. We easily walked to the Pantheon and several other sights in 20 minutes. We took the Metro to the Spanish Steps and Piazza del Popolo with no difficulties. A grocery store and plenty of excellent restaurants and bars are nearby for lunch and dinner. Rooms: Several reviews of other hotels complained about street noise and lack of air conditioning. Well I can tell you that the Capo D\u2019Africa rooms were very quiet, clean, comfortable and well air conditioned. Our bedroom was about 22x12 feet with a king size bed. A small foyer led to the bathroom which was a good size. The room had a mini-bar that we used as a small fridge for wine and water (purchased in the grocery store). A room safe was also an added feature. One reviewer mentioned the hair dryer in the dresser drawer (which was strange) but at was not a problem since it was in front of a mirror. Service: The staff spoke excellent English and were very polite, attentive and helpful. When we arrived several hours before check-in (on a Sunday morning) they were very accommodating. They were always ready to answer questions or provide assistance. The breakfast room on the 4th floor had a good selection of breakfast foods and friendly attentive staff. You can tell that service is a high priority with all of the staff. You can reserve bus tours at the front desk which was very helpful and saved us from a several hour wait on line at the Vatican. My only one slight demerit was the fact that you have to pay for internet access. I have been to many hotels and B&Bs that provide internet access as a free service to guests (like an ice machine). I was surprised given the quality of the hotel and pretty high room price that I had to shell out 5 euros for \u00bd hour of internet time check to my home e-mail.

It also scores very highly on the location front being within minutes of the Forum, Palatine and Colosseum yet on a backstreet and so sheltered from the noise of the 24/7 Roman traffic. But there were features lacking which would seperate it from what I would regard as luxury. We forgot our electricity adaptor. The hotel did not have one. There was no written information in the room about the hotel facilities or Rome itself. There was no one outside to help us with bags or hail a taxi (although the hotel would call one if requested). The breakfast was good quality but limited. When sitting in the lounge no one asked if we wanted a drink and we had to go to the bar (which was often unmanned) to get one. There was no restaurant and obtaining food (which could be served on the lovely terrace on the roof) seemed to require ordering at the bar downstairs and making your way up to the roof to seat yourself, the TV had limited international channels, and the bathrooms were cramped. Don't get me wrong, this hotel was a very good four star option and I would recommend it to those going to Rome who don't care about pampering in the extreme but don't be mistaken into thinking that this is a luxury hotel (however boutique) in the mould of the Hasslers, De Ruisse or Edens.

The location is brilliant in a rather quiet neighborhood by the Colosseum. I was worried that the area would be too quiet and a bit out of the way but I was wrong (or just a bit ignorant about my knowledge of the city). There are good restaurants in the vicinity, the metro stop, and the various hop on hop off tour buses all stop nearby. And plus, you never tire of the Colosseum view which you can see from the breakfast terrace. The hotel is pretty new and with modern decor. There is a nice space in the lobby for guests to gather. The rooms are not big but spacious enough and have comfortable beds. The bathrooms are small but that is probably pretty standard for Rome. I was not expecting anything bigger. They have room service which is decent and without an exorbitant price tag. Amenities in the hotel include meeting rooms and a fitness room but I did not see either so I cannot comment. Breakfast is included in the room rate and is more than sufficient with a good selection of food although you won't find anything that they cook (besides the hard boiled eggs). It's cold cuts, bread, cereals, fruit, and pasteries. The service we received from the hotel guests was fine, no complaints there. We didn't really have any special requests or needs, though. We stayed on the 3rd floor which is just below the 4th floor where the breakfast room is located. During breakfast hours, it was a bit noisy as you are able to hear all the foot traffic from above. I would imagine you would have the same issue if staying on the 4th floor where there were a few rooms as well. This wasn't a big deal for us but thought I would mention this if you want absolute peace and quiet. Perhaps request a room on the 2nd floor. This hotel definitely attracts a certain crowd who wants a quiet stay: people on honeymoon, seniors .... no teens/back-packers. I didn't notice people with children either.

We stayed at this hotel for 6 nights recently as we were celebrating our wedding in Rome. Firstly we would like to comment on the friendliness, efficiency and politeness of all the staff, household, breakfast room, reception, front of house, who made us comfortable and very welcome in this establishment. Two staff in particular stand out for us and that is as named above Roberto and Chiara, these two could not have been more friendly and nothing was too much trouble, Roberto in particular did one very special thing for us on our wedding day that we will always remember, so thank you Roberto once again. The decor in the hotel is modern and sleek, linen on the king size beds is of high quality, all rooms have air-conditioning, internet access, and double shower. The breakfast ser ved on the roof top terrace is included in the price of the room, you can eat breakfast with views of the Colosseum and chose from a varied buffet which includes fruits, croissants, cereals, juice, cheese, cold meats etc, oh and creamy cappucino's a must! Overall we were very pleased with our stay at the hotel and its proximity to Colosseum/ Palatine and metro station and several bars and restaurants. Overall we loved the city of Rome and this was our second visit there and second stay at Hotel Capo d'Africa. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to stay as the friendliness and politeness of the staff is exceptional, which unfortunately is not the rule for many other locals in this area that we encountered. We completely understand that Rome is over-run all year by tourists and it was the end of the tourist season but frankly tourism/ vatican are what keep this city afloat. We would like to point out 1 particular incident which occured at local restaurants during our stay, this is close to this hotel and if you are in a group of more than 3-4 people we would avoid and certainly not eat there again and would advise others to avoid also. 3 SCALINI-3 STEPS RESTAURANT This 1 particular place seemed to have a menu for \"tourists\" and a menu for locals, the ignorance and rudeness of the staff who served our table cannot be understated. We booked a family meal the evening after our wedding which admittedly was a large group, but we were not prepared for the disdain and disrespect in which we were treated, despite paying quite a sizeable amount for service at this restaurant which was: \"AI 3 SCALINI\" or \"THE 3 STEPS\" via DEI SS QUATTRO, about 2 blocks from this hotel. We were not given any choice about starters and ALL HAD TO EAT THE SAME STARTER, and we were told what we could order as main courses from 4 dishes again WE HAD NO CHOICE ABOUT MAIN DISH, despite the fact that we were PAYING CUSTOMERS and they had added a 10% COMPULSORY SERVICE CHARGE, we came away with a very bad taste in our mouths, felt ripped off. It was absolutely disgraceful. We have eaten in many places around the world and to say we were embarrassed and angry we had taken our family and friends here again is an understatement. LUZZI'S TRATTORIA-via SAN GIOVANNI IN LATERANO-Cheap and cheerful, nothing fancy, fill your belly type food. Locals eat here we think! Its fine if you are in a small group and most of our guests enjoyed lunch here at one point or another during their stay in Rome. Again avoid if you are in groups more than 4 otherwise you will be fine, or perhaps it was just that one particular waiter that we had the misfortune of being served by on our last night in Rome-no brownie points here for polite service either! I know none of this will put you off your visit to Rome as it truely is a fantastic city, we would highly recommend Hotel Capo d'Africa and the staff will make you feel welcome.... and if you fancy something really special to eat, then take a trip by taxi (very cheap fare) to either or both of the following places: \"Restaurant Romantica\" via Emanuele Filiberto, 52, 00185.....as for the manager Khaled, again superb food and service, this was were we had our wedding meal, our only regret is that we did not get back to eat here again- all 30 of our guests had no complaints whatsoever from here...and \"Trattoria da Luigi\" Piazza Sforza Cesarini, 24, 00186, Rome- just off Corso Vittorio Emanuele near Campo dei Fiori....we ate here as a large group-11 people, the service and food were superb, ask for a waiter by the name of Moni....then head for a pint in Scholars Irish Bar, via del Plebiscito...great craic, Irish, Americans, Scottish you name it, and the food here ain't bad either for pub grub.

The Colosseum is only a five minute walk away. Should you need to take the metro the Collosseo stop is nearby. There are several bars and restaurants close to the hotel.

Having said that we still managed to have a great time, it's just that we would go back at another time of the year.

There were a lot of hotels around this area that would have been more suitable for us. The hotel is very nice, modern and a refreshing change for Rome in its modern decor and ambience. The room we had was nice, although located on the same floor as the breakfast room meant that there was a fair bit of noise from 6am. Breakfast was in a nice room with a roof terrace. The food was a cold buffet with a hot option an optional extra, one point to note was that they had no idea what I was talking about when I asked for gluten free bread, despite being notified two months before. In general the reception staff were ok and pleasant but I did feel the lack of a clear concierge was an issue. With it being holiday time we enquired about restaurants that were potentially open - they gave me a list and told me to go and look at the individual restaurants to enquire if they are open, not exactly what I would expect as service. Whilst in Rome we saw all the usual sights which were great and it really was a wonderful city. We shopped like it was going out of fashion. We had diner at Imago, the rooftop restaurant at the Hassler Hotel - that was a great experience. Truly a beautiful hotel in a fantastic location.

Capo D'africa is a lovely place to stay for several reasons. First there's the location; just ten minutes' walk to the Coliseum and just over an hour to the Vatican. If you don't want to walk, taxis can be booked in reception or you can get bus or tube connections at the Coliseum. Next there's the huge range of restaurants - all within easy walking distance - providing good food at very reasonable prices and of much better quality than those in the popular tourist sites. We tried some of the ones recommended by other travellers and found them all very good. Finally there's the hotel itself. We had a view to the back and found it a comfortable haven of peace. The rooms are air conditioned, well furnished and the king size beds firm but comfortable. Throughout our stay the staff went out of their way to be helpful and the morning breakfast buffet on the rooftop terrace was fantastic. Very attentive service here too. A few tips. Drinks and food in the hotel were on the expensive side (for us at least) but there are good supermarkets close by selling a wide range of Italian snacks and wine. Watch out for badly maintained areas of pavement around Rome and especially near the Coliseum. Health and safety doesn't seem to figure very highly in Italy and some of the cobbled areas are lethal. However, walk if you can as there's so many interesting places to discover which you won't find if you are in a car or bus. If you've not been to Rome before, take an organised bus tour on the first day; this helps to get your bearings and provide ideas for places to visit. The red bus company seemed to be the best. Don't bother with bottled water. Take water flasks and fill up at one of the many drinking fountains you can find in the streets. The stuff out the tap is fine too unless it specifically states it's not for drinking. Toilets! Why are there no toilets seats in most Italian loos and why are they sometimes so basic? Take lots of tissues and wipes if this sort of thing bothers you. Finally, if you enjoy churches, make a point of visiting the one just opposite the hotel.

The only noise we heard were voices coming from the lobby briefly one night, but we solved that problem easily by closing the door in our external hallway. And then everything was perfect. The breakfast was way above average for continental. A variety of fresh fruits, cheeses, breads, juices, cerials, not to mention a nice terrace or breakfast room to watch the sunrise and take in the start of your day. And the American style coffee was among the best I had in Rome. The gym downstairs was clean and moderately well equipped. A stair master, a few free weights and about three weight machines. I had three good workouts while I was there. The neighborhood was also a welcome retreat from the madness of the Spanish Steps, Campo di Fiore, etc. etc. The local restaurants were good and not expensive. Great outdoor pizza place around the corner. I highly recommend leaving the neighborhood for at least one dinner however. Uno e Bino in San Lorenzo, an 8 minute cab ride or 30 minute walk has fantastic food, a great wine list, moderate prices (15 - 20 Euro per course). One of the best restaurants in Rome. Also, Roscioli. Fantastic antipasto, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, very good entrees. Really good service. Trattoria di Monti was good, but overrated. We went because the NY Times food critic plugged it. A big disappointment. Save your money. And your time. But do have gellato at San Crispino. It will take you to heaven. Especially on a hot summer afternoon. And don't leave Rome without visiting the Borghese. The most important museum in Rome. And do rent the audio guide. You'll miss most of the experience if you don't. The service at Capo was good to excellent. The only mix up was with the car at the airport. The driver was misinformed about our arrival time. It could have been my mistake however. Who knows? And it was not really a problem. We had a cafe in the airport while we waited.

First, the hotel is very nice, quite modern and chic, and resides in a quiet neighborhood not too far from the Colosseum. It is, however, quite expensive (285 euros per night) and although it is close to the roman ruins it is a fair distance away from other sites. I am not sure I would choose this hotel again if I was returning to Rome (and since I threw some coins into Trevi Fountain, I will return one day!). Regarding location, the hotel is not quite as close to the Colosseo metro station as some reviewers have stated. It is closer to 1000 meters than 200 meters and is a good ten minute walk. Turn left as you exit the metro station and walk along the sidewalk to the top of the hill. Cross the street twice to get to the opposite side, then walk up three or four blocks to Via Capo D'Africa. The hotel is at the end of this street about four blocks along. This is fairly manageable with suitcases although as mentioned the metro is very busy. If you arrive by train into Termini it is easy to find the metro and is only two stops to Colosseo. The airport though is a long way out, about 40 minutes from the hotel and a 50 euro fare by taxi. The rooms are modern and comfortable although they are a bit small (as is normal for Europe). No patio or view. The top floor has a nice breakfast area and the food was fine although much the same as in other italian hotels. There is a small bar area at the front door, but no restaurant. The neighborhood does have several restaurants nearby so that is not a problem. The hotel is perfect for touring the old ruins. I would suggest that you walk past the ruins until you get to the large white old Senate Building on the left. Walk around it then go up the stairs to the main plaza. This is the entrance to the Musee Capitolina, an excellent place to start and a good museum. It also has a great view of the ruins below. After seeing the museum you can work your way back to the hotel by walking through the ruins and then going to the Colosseum. As others have mentioned, you can buy a combo ticket for Palatine Hill (located about halfway through the ruins on the hillside) and the Colosseum at Palatine and save yourself a long line at the Colosseum. Even better, buy a Roma-Pass at Palatine for 20 euros. This will get you in free to Palatine/Colosseo plus one other museum such as the Gallery Borghese, plus give you three days of free metro. And best of all, you can use your pass to go straight into the Colosseo without waiting in line at all. See [--] for more info. However, once you've conquered the ruins, the Capo is a fair distance away from other attractions, such as the Vatican and the Pantheon, Villa Borghese, etc. The metro system in Rome is not that great (and is very busy) and many attractions are a long way away from the nearest metro station. The pantheon for instance is a good 20 minute walk to the nearest station. Next time I am in Rome I might prefer to stay somewhere a little closer to the downtown area, maybe around the Spanish Steps, which is a very lively area. Be careful to check when the metro stations close. We had dinner downtown on Friday night and found two metro stations were closed at 9:30. Not sure if that is normal but we had to take a taxi back to the hotel. The Vatican and Basilica are fairly accessable by metro although again it is a decent walk from the station. If you want to beat the crowds, go to the basilica early. It opens at 7, the dome opens at 8, and the tombs open at 9. We got there just after 8 and walked right in and saw everything in 90 minutes or so, and were out before the crowds and tour buses started to arrive. As for the Vatican Museum, the lineup must have been a mile long at 10am. Unbelievable. I had booked a two hour Vatican tour though at 10:30 (through Select Italy) and so we basically walked in and beat the lines. Very worthwhile, although when we got out there wasn't much of a line left. So maybe going later in the day is a good idea too. If you stay here, make sure you see the Basilica de San Clemente, which is just around the corner from the hotel. Go into the gift shop and then down the stairs into the archeological area where the ruins of a 4th century church and 1st century temple are. Very interesting and we almost missed it. Also worthwhile and a bit more of a walk is the Santa Maria Maggiore church. By the way, the hotel map given on arrival is not very good. Rome is a very hard city to find your way around and we got lost many times. It was maddening trying to find some attractions. Try to get yourself a decent map. Dining-wise, there are a few choices nearby. As mentioned by other reviewers, Le Naumachie is fairly good and reasonably priced. Walk out the hotel and turn right, then right on the first street, and it is just a block or so down on the left. I really enjoyed Papagio, which is on Via Capo D'Africa and about three blocks from the hotel (and right beside an irish pub). Papagio is quite a bit classier than the pizzerias in the area and we had a very nice meal here. White tablecloths, soft music, nice art on the wall, and good food with some nice seafood dishes (we had turbot and sea bass, both excellent). A bit pricier with entrees in the 22-30 euro range. Another reviewer mentioned Luzzi, which was very rustic looking but actually did have decent food.

Found it on this site and thanks to all who wrote before me- they were right, it is a lovely place. We checked in early, and were most courteously treated by every staff memeber. The room was of a nice size- we'd just taken a transatlantic crossing so we apreciated the space. The bath was great, the bed was comfortable, and the internet access was a breeze. We were a two minute stroll to the Colosseum and its handy metro stop, providing you did not get lured by some tempting morsel of food along the way, alas. Breakfast was nice, and you could certainly see the landmark of Rome as you sipped your coffee. The pictures show the truth here, but cannot come close to letting you know who very wonderful the staff was. Management must be applauded, you can see that a well- treated staff is in operation here, and we give them full marks, from bellman Massimo to every kind soul at the front desk, and everyone in between. The hotel has a nice modern feel, while still remaining very Italian. We did not need plaster columns and cherubic angels to know we were in Italy, and we appreciated the design touches everywhere. We like the grand dames and we like the modern styles too, so we do well most everyhwere as long as it feels inviting. The decor was great, very refreshing. Quick tip- if you do the Hop On/ Off bus, do yourself a favor and only book the red bus. We grabbed the green bus and were disappointed- stops were very hard to find, and it ran over an hour late one day at our stop, no explanation or apology. Four red busses passes us as we waited for our green bus. The hostsess aboard the bus practically tried to talk us out of it and now I know why, so learn from my mistake and please choose the red! My husband loved the hotel dearly, and he is the pickiest- to get praise from him is noteworthy. I loved the location, it was quiet at night so we slept very well, and then a short metro or cab ride to the next site. He thinks in retrospect that he prefers the area near Pantheon but I expect it might be noisier. It was nice to come home late by light of the wonderfully lit Colossuem, and I bet we stay there again next time we are in the eternal city.

Wasn't disappointed at all and it was a special trip for my 50th birthday. As many other reviewers report, excellent reception and housekeeping, room very comfortable - including the beds. The style of mattress - tempur- shapes itself to you so whilst it feels a little firm when you plonk yourself down on it, we slept wonderfully well. Some reviewers had complained of the rooms being warm or no air conditioning on, the air con was on in April so I didn't need to use the electric fan that I had packed. Stayed for 4 nights 22-26 April, enjoyed breakfasts outside on the terrace, in the sun, with the Coliseum behind us. Perfect! Waiting staff charming and very helpful. Pick the blood orange fruit juice, it was delicious and proper juice, unlike the other offerings in the juice dept. We found the choices fine and to our taste. You can also sit up on the terrace in the evening, we very much enjoyed a bottle of Prosecco up there our first night, taking in the scene. We enjoyed meals at Papagio and - annoyingly - one I can't remember the name of which was just a block immediately down from the hotel, on the right - smart looking with tables outside and crisp white cloths - we ate a lovely lunch there on the last day. We also tried La Naumaucherie , food fine, maybe not so much atmosphere there I thought, but could have been because I was sat facing a wall, at the back of the restaurant (it was a busy night!) We did the hop on hop off 110 buswhich you can catch from the Coliseum. You can buy 2 day tickets as you board. For the last 2 days we took taxis or walked. Taxis are easy to find, they are located before you cross the road to the Coliseum and are then found at ranks by most of the major sights. All trips were 7 to 10eu and well worth it. If you have booked the Capo, relax, you wil not be disappointed. When you see the crowds at the Spanish Steps you will be pleased you are staying in an oasis of calm. Finally, we had a car from Rome cabs (romecabs.com) for our journey from the airport, very reliable cost 45e for single trip to Fiumicino. Friends who travelled separately to Ciampino airport got a cab at the airport (price regulated nowadays), and got the hotel to call a cab for the return journey, all very easy.

There are 60 plus rooms and it was constructed 5 years ago, using the site of a former high school. It used to be a 19th Century Monastery, and during the construction of the hotel, they had to preserve the marble stair cases both in and out. In fact, all of the hotel has mable floors. I am giving the hotel an excellent rating, even though we had a problem, that had it not been resolved, might have made this rating lower. My husband and I always book two rooms with a connecting door inbetween. This request was granted IN WRITING so I didn't bother calling prior to check-in. Imagine our surprise when we were told there were none available and that even our rooms would not be adjoining (that was changed later the first day). We thought about trying to find another hotel, but it was Labor Day weekend and were told it would likely be impossible. The next day, thanks to the Assistant Housekeeper, I was moved to a room next to my husband's, which could be closed off to the main hallway with a locking door. We left our room doors open and it was even better than having a connecting door. The beds are firm but I had no problem sleeping. The bathroom had both toilet and bidet. The shower was in a tub and had the annoying habit of scalding or freezing you just as you felt you were safe! Also, I think for a 4 star hotel they should offer more than shampoo and liquid shower soap. Every morning we went up to the Terrace to have Continental Breakfast. I love Cappuccino's and would have two. The rest of the breakfast was pretty ordinary, but satisfying. If you wanted a hot breakfast i;e bacon, eggs etc. you could order room service, but there was a charge. Before dinner, we would sit at the bar near the reception desk before we went out to eat. Or you could go up to the Terrace and have drinks. The Terrace had a small menu for both lunch and dinner, but there were many great restaurants to eat at within a short walking distance. Ask the front desk and they will make reservations for you at any of them. We were in Rome this time for 4 days following a cruise. In 2003, before a cruise, we found the most wonderful private tour guides, Max and Fabio Leotta, who own Leotta Limousine Service. Max picked us up at the cruise ship dock in a Mercedes van as we had lots of luggage. The following day he drove us on a tour into the countryside in a Mercedes sedan. They both have studied Roman history and are well versed in all Rome has to offer.

One restaurant to give particular mention to was Papagio's which is about 100 yards along the street from the hotel. This was a real gem. It is a fish restaurant of the highest quality.

From there the people at the front desk were always willing to help you on your way or give some suggestions as to what to do or how best to do it, and in the evening the bar was just the place to unwind with some nice relaxing drinks. The location of this hotel is perfect for old Rome. Everything else is within a 30 min walk if you are so inclined.

Believe not a word of it. Two taxi drivers who I approached stated that the fare would be between 50 and 55 euros.

I have to agree with most of the previous reviews on this site. We paid for a standard room, the cheapest, working on the assumption that we would not be spending much time in it. The room was compact but adequate as was the bathroom. The bed was large and very comfortable. If I want to be picky the only faults were a) The bathroom floor needed a wash and was sticky, b) the bedroom carpet could have done with a clean but you do get some nice red slippers to overcome this, c) the mini bar did not get cold, but I did not plan on using it and d) the air conditioning was not terribly effective but being February that did not really matter. The breakfast was ample and good quality being a mixture of cereals, rolls and cold meats and cheeses. The staff were all excellent, very friendly, helpful and polite.

If it were not for a direct comparison with the previous hotel, including the relatively high price for a mediocre room and the pillow incident, I would have given the hotel a \"4\" rating rather than \"2\".", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, good service - Satisfied with stay\u201d", "Author": "Catou", "ReviewID": "UR6611140", "Content": "Decided to stay at the Capo after reading all the great reviews (and some of the not-so-great reviews, too) and after deciding that I wanted to stay in a hotel in and around Ancient Rome. If you want to stay in and around Ancient Rome, THIS IS THE hotel you want to book. The hotel is a five minute walk from the Colloseum and it was nice to see it at day and a night during our walk-abouts. We stayed at the Capo for four nights in the first week of January 2007. I booked through Expedia and got a Deluxe room for $179 (US) a night. For that price, I believe we got a great deal - I don't believe the hotel is worth spending $300/night on. Good things about the hotel: 1) Great service. All persons at the front desk were always very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. For first time visitors, I believe this is very important. For that alone, I would return to this hotel and recommend others to do the same. 2) Rooms were clean and well appointed, and modern. Sufficient closet space, high ceilings, huge windows and an in-room safe. In all, the hotel is quite beautiful. 3) Great Location. 5-10 minute walk to the sites of Ancient Rome; Palantine Hill, Capitaline Hill and the Colloseum. Colloseo metro station is also right there which is great to take (not during rush hours) to get around. Not-so-great things about the hotel/ inconsistent things from the reviews: 1) BREAKFAST: Breakfast was decent. It is included in your stay after all, but the breakfast is average. Juice, coffee and cappucino is very good. Breakfast room is light, airy, clean. The breakfast patio is also very beautiful but you do not get a clear view of the Colloseum as advertised. You can see a corner of the structure and only from one part of the patio. It's still a great patio to go up to and relax with a drink, though. 2) ROOM: Room is a good size by European standards, but I wished the bathroom had been a bit bigger. The bed is hard, not concrete (but I'm sure that's somewhat subjective) - Wished, like the other reviewer we had better bedding (sheets were heavily starched), and a duvet - but the pillows were nice. Wished we had more towels too! (the reviews say they provide you with a bathrobes and slippers, but all we got were slippers) 3) INTERNET ACCESS: Wished the hotel had free internet in the lobby - (there is an internet cafe a street or two down I later discovered) - wound up buying a $25 Euro internet card for access to Capo's internet. 4) FOOD: Neighborhood where hotel is good (banks, little shops, bars), but stay away from the restaurants that are the closest to the Colloseum as they tend to be more expensive. I recommend going to Trastevere (trendier night area not too tourist-y) and venturing to those restaurants there. The Naumachie that everyone raves about (and recommended by the hotel) was affordable, but I wasn't thrilled with the food. Stick to the basics when ordering there. What we did a night or two (to save on money) is that we stopped at a little pizza shop and a wine store (both all nearby) - got a couple slices, and a bottle of wine and brought it back to our room. It was perfect. FEW TIPS: 1) Like other reviews: don't wait in line to get into the colliseum. Walk up to Palantine Hill and purchase a ticket there (allows for entrance to both Palantine and the Colloseum for 11 Euros per person) 2) Take the metro (if you're sick of walking or want to get somewhere in a hurry), don't take cabs! It's fairly easy to navigate (there are only two lines A and B - the exchange is at Termini) - to get yourself to the Spanish Steps and/or the Vatican 3) If there are long lines at the Colloseum and/or Vatican and an English guide approaches you for a tour - take it - cuts your waiting time by half if not more! I was apprehensive about this: it is legitimate, BUT expensive. For us, we didn't have the patience to wait in line (especially at the Vatican) and it was the best thing we did. Both of our guides spoke english extremely well, were knowledgeable and made our tour super enjoyable and interesting. 4) Wear comfortable shoes (it's hard to do in Rome, after all - you want to be fashionable). We walked everywhere- everywhere (most of the time) and your feet/legs will ache! 5) One or two weeks before your trip, make a reservation for the Galleria Borghese (google and go the official website). This is a must and you need reservations ahead of time before going! It was well worth it -- and the Golden House of Nero, too (unfortunately it was closed while we were there)", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel for this price.\u201d", "Author": "John.Trip", "ReviewID": "UR6606132", "Content": "Just returned (Jan 2007) from a 5 day, 4 night stay at the Capo d'Africa Hotel in Rome.

As previous reviewers have commented don\u2019t pick the hotel for stunning views of famous landmarks, except for limited views of the Coliseum from the terrace. However, the views are of genuine little apartment blocks etc. perhaps the real local Rome. Perhaps a 20-30 minute walk to many of the good tourist sites. Others can easily be reached by the Metro (10 mins away) or busses/trams. From the minute we arrived the staff were great, bags taken to the room, with a full explanation of where everything was and how it worked. The Concierge (Mario) immediately provided us with a tourist map along with that special circling of interesting locations, directions, times etc. We arrived at lunchtime and asked Mario for a lunch recommendation, we got 3, from formal 1 hour+, through pizzeria, to bars with snacks. We opted for the pizzeria (Le Naumachie) which was great for food and very reasonably priced. We tried the slightly more formal (Bocconcino) for dinner another night and again it was great and reasonable. Another local favourite of ours was Hostaria Tsidoro (not recommended by the hotel). The hotel was very contemporary and stylish, most fittings, lights, tables and so on seem to be from well known designer ranges. Everywhere was spotlessly clean, with 5* touches like turn down service, robes, slippers and so forth. A large, comfortable bar/reception area offered a full bar and cocktail service. The barman also mixed a perfect Bombay Sapphire and tonic. The breakfast area was lovely with prompt and courteous service (always 3 staff, for a small hotel) with a good selection of continental style fruit/cereals/cheeses/meats/breads.

My husband and I stayed at the Capo D'Africa for 10 nights in April 2005. I cannot state enough positives about this hotel. Our stay at Capo D'Africa contributed to beautiful memories about Italy and Rome that will never, ever fade! This was our first trip to Italy (and to Rome), so we were a bit apprehensive about what to expect. We wanted to stay in a hotel off the \"beaten-path\" a bit because we did not want to be caught up in tourist traps for 10 days. Capo D'Africa exceeded all of our expectations and I actually cried on the day we had to return to New York! My husband and I couldn't believe how beautiful the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood was when our driver pulled up to the hotel. When we entered the lobby, we were immediately greeted with Italian warmth and hospitality that absolutely never ended! Being of Italian descent, I immediately felt a connectedness to the hotel, the staff, the city of Rome and its people! This was a trip I will never forget! The hotel staff were all wonderful! Over the 10 days, they knew I was studying Italian, so they all chipped in to help me with the language! Oftentimes, my husband and I lingered at the funky lobby bar prior to a night out, where I delighted in \"chatting\" with the bartender in Italian. It was so much fun! I won't bother to repeat all the positives about this hotel in DETAIL but I will reiterate that the hotel is beautiful, the staff are wonderful, the rooms are immaculately clean with all attention given to even the smallest detail! The decor in the hotel is cool and hip without being overdone or \"pretentious.\" The rooftop brunch every morning (included in the room rate) was SUPERB! The views of the surrounding area are spectacular and the food choices at brunch exceed most \"typical\" European brunches by offering fruit, pastries, fresh Italian meats, freshly cooked egg dishes, rolls, breads, fresh juices, cappuccino, etc. The neighborhood is about a 15 minute walk to Centro Storico (the \"Center\" of Rome) and/or a short subway ride to ALL the major attractions of Rome including the Piazza Navona, the Piazza del Popolo, the Spanish Steps, the Vatican, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain, the Campidoglio, the Villa Borghese, the Via Veneto, etc, etc. Additionally, this hotel is very near the Colosseo, which is part of the ancient Roman Ruins that comprise the Imperial and Roman Forums. So the neighborhood is VERY historic (but then again, so is ALL of Rome)! Finally, my husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the neighborhood surrounding the hotel. We frequented restaurants, trattorias, delis, etc and EVERYONE was completely wonderful! My paternal grandfather was from Rome and my mom was born in Caserta Pratella (near Naples), so I felt a true affinity for the people of Rome! The Roman people, including the folks at the hotel, and the experiences they helped us create, is something that will never be forgotten!

We were given the room next to the breakfast room (412) and we were a little worried that it would be noisy in the morning. We barely heard a thing. In fact, when we went to breakfast we were expecting the room to be empty but it was actually quite full so that shows how good the sound-proofing was. I'd want to give the hotel a 4.5 star rating rather than a 4...it's good but it's not quite perfect. Over two nights (where the hotel was full, according to the front desk) I went to the hotel bar whilst my wife was finishing getting ready. The bar was very nice and the barman very friendly but there was no atmosphere. My guess would be because the drinks were very expensive (6 Euros for a beer or glass of wine...at least double what they were in many of the nighbouring bars...even though they were lovely - particularly the wine) and the service was limited. I think I was lucky in that I was served promptly but one couple sat there for a good ten minutes and walked out without being served. Anyway...that's a small negative for a hotel that I'd definitely recommend. And...thinking about the review a couple of posts down, we're English, don't look particularly rich and the service we received was friendly, efficient and just right. We also got the hotel car back to the airport (we'd got the train and metro on the way in but wanted to maximise the time left on our last day) and the driver was far too fast for me. I wish I'd asked him to slow down but we were too polite to do so! One tip for the hotel...once you know your way around, the hotel isn't much further away from line A on the metro as it is to line B. A short walk gets you to the orange line which serves the Vatican. That seemed easier than getting the metro from the Collosseo station to Termini, and then change lines, to get to the Vatican. Plus, the overland tram 3 takes you to the trendy Trastevere area. Food...we went to la Neaumachie (as everyone on this forum who stayed at this hotel seems to recommend) and it was superb. Great food and service. There's also a nice Irish pub on the Capo d'Africa road which was very busy on Saturday night. Rome's a fantastic city but I can't imagine how busy it must get in the summer or at Easter.

What a surprise then, to find that the hotel was snobby, pretty standard (and we've never stayed in a four star hotel before) and that everything we had heard about it was just hype. I was so disappointed as we were on our honeymoon and thought that at least the staff would be welcoming and nice to us. The room was smaller than a Travelodge standard room (not very large), not overly clean, the bedlinen and towels had holes in them, the bed and pillows were hard and uncomfortable, the view was limited to the rooftop of a shabby appartment opposite, there was no kettle (something us Brits are accustomed to), and the promised \"designer toiletries\" consisted of a small plastic tube of shampoo and bath foam - oh and a little bar of soap. Of course, the Americans in the hotel seemed to have a whale of a time and were treated as true guests - all reception, bar and consierge staff fell over themselves to do whatever they demanded from them - but we received none of this hospitality - despite paying equal amounts. In fact, one of the consierge staff held open the entrance door for a couple of Americans but let it close in front of my face as we tried to get in the door. I was disgusted, hurt and very upset. What a shame. I honestly thought that it would be the perfect hotel for our honeymoon but I was very wrong.

Your room was serviced twice aday to a high standard.Overall the hotel inside and out is spotless. Each evening after eating at a local restaurant we ended up back at the hotel bar, purely because of the service and company.I'm extremely fussy and hard to please so this is a great compliment! Rome was lovely but it was sad to leave the hotel. Mario and Adolfo are the hotels greatest asset from a clients point of view, they are a good double act! P.S. Don't believe a word Adolfo tells you about Mario,I'm sure he's spreading nasty rumours !!! We'd like to thank him for the Italian lesson GraatzeeA!

It was our first time in Europe and found the hotel thru TripAdvisor.com. After reading excellent reviews on the hotel, we decided to book this hotel. It was fabulous! We were on a 3 city trip: Rome, Venice, and London and by far this was the best hotel we stayed at during our trip! The staff was friendly and the rooms were very clean. Nice king size bed and the bed was comfortable. I also found that the location was great. The street was quiet, away from the hussle and bussle of the busy city and close to the Colosseum. Breakfast is served on the terrace which is a great way to start the day. We did use the metro while we were there (closest metro station is by the Colosseum, 10 minute walk). It's not the high-tech metro system of London, but it was good to travel on. There are several resturants around the hotel and a food market also. One night we just stayed in and went to the local markent and bought bread, cheeses, and meats and stayed in to rest. After touring the city for 5 days and seeing other hotels, I knew we had chosen the best hotel in town. A few tips about Rome. 1. Lock everything in the safe of value in your room. We felt very safe and comfortable at this hotel. 2. For souveneir shopping, the shops around Trevie Fountain are the best. Also visit Trevie Fountain at night, very beautiful. 3.Eat lots of gilato! 4.Plan your days while in Rome so you get to see everything because there is so much to see. We grouped things that were close together in location to maximize our time there. 5. We did a tour for the Vatican Museum which was a complete waste of money. (GreenLine Tours) There are so many people at the Vatican, that we could not hear anything the guide was saying and we felt rushed thru the museum. Do the museum yourself so that you can see everything and spend as much time there as you want. Beware the lines are long no matter what time you get there! We arrived at 7:30 a.m. and stood in line for 2-1/2 hours! 6.Check your bill when eating at a resturant. It is legal to charge a service charge which most resturants do. However, it is Illegal to charge a cover charge in Rome. We did catch one place that tried to charge us a cover charge and when we pointed it out they said no problem don't pay it. Overall, we had an amazing trip and this hotel was great. I would definately stay here again and recommend to my family and friends.

The hotel, although close to the Colosseum, was quite a walk from the other attractions but doable. We walked everywhere - take very comfy shoes. The wide road next to the Colosseum was closed to traffic on the Sunday morning and it had a fantastic carnival atmosphere. We loved the piazza next to the Pantheon and particularly the Piazza Trastevere and a walk up the hill for some wonderful views of the city. Rome was full of atmosphere - lots of wonderful old ruins being unearthed even now. We had blue skies for the whole of our stay and it was t shirt weather throughout. The locals all seemed to wear autumnal clothing -jacket, jeans and boots. There were some lovely bars and restaurants near the hotel particularly the Neumachine, and wonderful service at Pasqualino's.

We arrived Rome from the train terminal. The taxi fare to the hotel costed only 8 Euro. When we arrived, we immediately noted a signage on the reception desk showing \"2005 Tripadvisor traveler's choice\". As same as previous comments, the staff really provided us a pleasant and professional check-in service. They arranged us a room on the 1st floor (ground floor) near the staircase. The room is large, but the bathroom is quite small (no bath tub). It seems to me that the hotel itself is a typical business hotel. The room is on average: clean but nothing special. I advise not to choose the room #105. The room is close to the staircase, and every morning around 5:00am we were awaken by the noise coming from there. I did not know what happened but the sound is quite annoying! The breakfast was general, similar to what we had in other places in Europe. Besides the professional staff services, I could not find something that we felt surprise. Before our stay, we had read so many superb comments from tripadvisor. However, we may expect too much. The hotel is about 8 minutes walk from/to the Colosseo metro, and 20 minutes to the Palazzo di Venezia. We took the metro once but the metro in Rome is terrible. It may be the poorest in Europe: bad smell, train broken down on the half way between two stations, strange people on the train that made you uncomfortable. Afterwards when we went outside, we would took a bus #85 or #87 instead along the Via Labicana. I suggest anyone who comes back hotel from Plazza Spagna can take a bus #117 in the Via Del Corso. The cutie bus will stop at the corner of Via Del Querceti and Via S. Giovanni In Laterano, where we spent only one minute walking back to the hotel. Although the metro station is not very far, we really felt tired when we carried a number of shopping bags. Besides, we recommend you try a restaurant Luzzi which locates close to the hotel. We had a delicious pasta and pizza there. The price is relatively cheap. Overall speaking, I think the hotel is over price and over rated. My wife likes shopping.

Breakfast was more than adequate, fresh fruit, cereals,cheeses meats, rolls and pastries. We arrived Friday morning and had booked online a return ticket for the Terravision coach which runs from the airport to the Termini station in the centre of Rome; this saved time queuing at the airport and took around 30 mins. From Termini we took a white taxi to the hotel which was 10 euros. Make sure you use a licenced one which pulls up at the taxi rank. We took a taxi Sat morning to the Vatican so as to be there to join the early queue and this was 10 euros.

The hotels varied from very good to bad via mediocre and ambivalent. Reluctantly I've become expert in all the nuances of hotel living sometimes for weeks on end out of a suitcase. Add into the mix holidays taken as well and in my view, hotels can make or break any stay, there are many facets to the hotel experience that can please you or infuriate you. To save you reading the rest of this if you are pushed for time. In short, the Capo D'Africa hotel excels at everything a top-quality hotel should do, in my rating, there's very good and above that there's the Capo. Go there and you will not be disappointed one bit in your choice. Rome itself has plenty of good reasons to extend your stay, staying at the Capo adds one more making saying ciao to this wonderful city even harder. If you are still reading, myself and my girlfriend had a four day stay in Rome for the first time and chose this hotel on the strength of the reviews here. They didn't disappoint, I'm a bit of cynic (see above) and don't recommend anywhere easily but with the Capo it is completely unreserved. My girlfriend has a good eye for detail (show me a woman that doesn't) and she was bowled over by the care and attention of the Capo to their guests. The Capo is an excellent place to base yourself, situated a five minute walk from Colosseo metro station, it is located at the end of Via Capo D'Africa and is quiet and sufficiently secluded (if that is possible in Rome) for a peaceful nights sleep isolated well away from the bustle of the Colosseum and Old Rome yet remaining within easy walking distance of them. On arrival, the exterior of the hotel oozes style. Inside, the reception area is contemporary neo-modernist in decor and art, airy and welcoming. At the reception desk, the staff are simply world-class. They are friendly, very knowledgable and take the time to explain the facilities. They maintain an excellent sense of humour, are easy to get on with and it is clear they love their work. I had contacted them before our stay to specify a double (which was a large king size bed) rather than a twin and also a room in a quieter part of the hotel. They fulfilled this to the letter. During your stay, if you need to know anything about how to get somewhere, out comes a free map, circling your destination and where you are now and advice how to get there. For example, for our trip to Vatican City we expected an early start and long queues, their advice was spot-on. Leave the early start to those that like that kind of thing, if you want to take your time and still see the Museum and Sistine Chapel, the queues die down at 11am so go then. If you need to arrange transport, a taxi is called, arrives promptly and is reasonably priced. Our trip to Vatican City was a fair way and a fair ten euros. It wasn't a one off, another cab ride to Spanish Steps was six euros, perfectly reasonable for the distance. Just make sure the meter is running, not that we had to remind them once. If you want a good trattoria or restaurant but aren't sure where to go, ask the concierge. Every eating establishment they recommend not only fitted our requirement perfectly but also enhanced our stay. They were not tourist traps but had a good representation from the local inhabitants, always the mark of a good restaurant in my eyes. The food was always good, always the real deal. I can add to their recommendation of Papagio especially on a Friday for seafood, the traditional day of the week in Italy to take such a repast. It was some of the best I have eaten, fine Italian food and good service. The concierge will make the reservation for you if you give them a little notice. In the case of Papagio, you will need to book in advance especially to dine al-fresco which is very popular there. In short, the reception staff and concierge service are a model on how it should be done, I know I will be very hard pressed to find a hotel with better. For a hotel with four floors, it has modern lifts, quiet in operation, important for a room close to them and getting to your room with luggage is no problem. The rooms follow the style statement made by the hotel reception, they are very well appointed, stylish, airy and large by European standards, the quality of the fittings is first-class. The beds are comfortable, the linen is top notch and the towels are top quality. The air-con is adjustable from cold blizzard to a literal whisper which didn't wake us during the night. The curtains are layered and offer an excellent blackout from the bright Italian sun. Another nuance that makes a stay just that little bit better. Another hotel bugbear is there is nothing worse than jiggling your keycard in your room lock trying to get in the early hours with some vino collapso inside you. Theirs is credit card sized (nothing unusual there) and fits in your wallet. But the key is a proximity card waved in front of a sensor next to the door and is simplicity itself to operate. Once in the room, placing your card in the provided slot activates power to the room and informs staff outside that it is occupied so no chance of an 8am knock on the door from the maid wanting to clean your room. It's these nice touches that really makes the Capo special. When the maid did get in, it was well attended to and there was no need to get them back to do anything that was missed. All tastes are catered for at breakfast and al-fresco on the terrace is a great way to start the day. The patios are lined with plants, there is shade and plenty of room, one terrace adjoined to the breakfast bar is overlooked by the Colosseum. The staff are friendly and cannot do enough to make sure your breakfast is relaxed; it is open until 11am which makes a lie-in easily achievable. An unfortunate accident with a little red wine required the use of laundry services, this was efficient, easy to use, prompt and the red wine was a mere memory not a stain. The hotel will arrange travel to and from the airport if you wish, we decided to get there under our own steam on the Metro which is fairly straightforward (Take the fast train to Termini from the airport and then the two stops from Termini to Colosseo Metro Station). We opted to take the hotel provided transport on the way home. Efficient and priced well at fifty euro (it's a long-ish trip) back to Leonardo Da Vinci. Leave yourself plenty of time it's a good half-hour drive out in thin traffic. We loved our stay at the Capo and there is nothing to fault it on. The Capo isn't the cheapest place to stay admittedly but it offers far more for the money than you expect making it very good value indeed. To know you are booked into excellent accomodation puts your mind at rest to concentrate on enjoying Rome. We never managed to see everything Rome has to offer, we didn't expect to, mixing sight-seeing with grande dollops of la dolce vita but we know we will be back. We will definitely be staying at the Capo again, Rome wouldn't be the same without it. One last piece of advice, only use the word 'grande' sparingly in Rome.

We were immediately offered a room that was already prepared but as it was a smoking room which we did not want so we settled in to one of the very comfortable sofas and had a quick beer, I say quick but we were expecting to have to wait a couple of hours, around 20 minutes passed when the receptionist advised us that our room was now ready but to stay where we were and finish our drinks while the door man took our luggage up to the room. When we did get to the room we were very pleased with the cleanliness, (I suppose it had just been cleaned), and the overall feel of the room, lots of space, modern furniture and an average sized bathroom. The bathroom was a vision in white and marble and had plenty of hotel branded toiletries which we actually found to be quite good quality. The bed was very firm but all in all very comfortable, (and not what you would call small!!!). After our first evening in Rome we were looking forward to a day of sightseeing and felt that a hearty breakfast was in order, however we understood that the european breakfast probably would not consist of a giant plate of fried heart attack, and we were correct there, although you can order various cooked eggs n'stuff from the room service menu at an additional cost. What we were treated to was a large array of pastries, meats, cheeses, bread, fruit, juices and cereal. The quality of the breakfast food was excellent, (we especially liked the custard filled croisants). Breakfast is eaten on the roof terrace but the number of tables with a Colosseum view are limited so you may have to be patient if this is one of your reasons for staying here. After a day of sightseeing and another lovely meal at Pasqualino's trattoria just around the corner we returned to CD'A for a drink on the roof terrace which was quickly and efficiently delivered to us. When we returned to our room the bed had been turned down, a bedside mat had been laid out for each of us and the complimentary slippers were waiting eagerly for our aching feet. On our final night at the hotel we ordered room service dinner which we chose from the small but comprehensive menu. The food was nothing out of the ordinary if I am honest but it did the trick. The location of the hotel is ideal for checking out the sights and sounds of Rome, it is 2 minutes walk from the Colosseum from where you can catch the Metro to most other tourist sights. TIP: buy your Colosseum entry ticket at Palatine, just up the hill from the Colosseum and it saves you the trouble of queueing to get in!! The neighbourhood is quiet and we found it to be safe, there are plenty of Trattorie and bars dotted around the side streets near the hotel as well as a tobacconists, a small supermarket and an acceptable Gelataria.

After booking the Hotel (easy process direct with Hotel - great English) - I also informed them that it was for our first anniversary and how much we were looking forward to this. I asked if a bottle of something could be placed in the Room for our arrival. Upon getting there, after a nightmare taxi journey (see tip at bottom of this), we were greeted by super friendly staff, whose first words were \"Congratulations on your anniversary and welcome to Rome\". Maybe its the old romantic in me, but that was nice and personal, a touch lacking in major Hotels around the world. The Desk Manager then proceeded to tell us they had upgraded our room for free and then gave us a quick resume of spots to visit in Rome and dining alternatives. Very quick, very efficient and very informative. The room was big (for European standards) and super clean. The Hotel in general is very modern with nice modern art touches and splashes of colour in subtle ways. Best of all the Hotel exists in a side street away from the Colliseum that is one way. Little traffic passes and thus, in a busy and hustling city like Rome, it maintains an air of calmness. In the room was a bottle of decent Champagne, with the compliments of the Hotel, a nice touch again considering I had requested this and they had every right to charge me for this. Again, just a little thing, but they count. As for location, I had read it was slightly further out from Rome centre than some Hotels, but we figured Rome was for walking and this wouldnt be a problem, altho take a good pair of shoes, because you will walk a lot! However, the compensation for being only slightly further away from the centre is that at night it is quieter. And safe. We walked back every night from either the centre or from the Piazza Navone, which has 20-30 open air restaurants in a large beautiful square and was fantastic place to eat at night and then head into Rome centre or wander the backstreets. The location of the Coliseum is literally at the bottom of the street that Capo D Africa sits on, and what a sight it is. From the Breakfast Room you can see it, and I cant imagine many sights better than overlooking Rome, drinking coffee in the morning and having the Coliseum in the foreground. And finally after a long day walking, to get back to the hotel and go to the secluded roof terrace and relax with a beer and dhakiri (ok, I had the dhakiri and the wife had the beer but hey, we're a modern couple...), that was excellent. To find a quiet roof terrace like that in one of the busiest cities in Europe and to be able to unwind was worth the price alone. I think one reviewer also had this experience and hopefully others will too, as no-one seemed to know it existed as it was always empty! Rome itself was excellent and we found the Romans warm and welcoming. The Capo D Africa was a great choice and when we go back I know that it is the ONLY hotel we will consider booking. I rarely recommend Hotels to friends and family, as everyone has their own tastes and preferences, but I have and will recommend this hotel to anyone who asks. My thanks to the staff and the Hotel. We will be back, without question. Major Tip if staying here: DO NOT take a taxi at the airport - you will be ripped off - phone the Hotel direct before arrival and ask if their limo service will pick you up. Its cheaper, 55 Euros as opposed to the 88 we paid for our \"official\" airport taxi and they dont drive at 100 miles an hour and are far more pleasant.", "Date": "July 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hertfordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cA fabulous hotel\u201d", "Author": "AlexWright", "ReviewID": "UR5499363", "Content": "We had a fantastic time at this hotel near to the Colloseum in Rome.

Not a cheap option for dinner but well worth it. If you want to dine out of the hotel the staff can help with very good recommendations. There are some lovely little restaurants in the area, but also some terrible ones - that's why asking the staff's advice is a good idea.

The hotel has a good location and everything within Rome is walkable. We even walked to the Vatican, though thats a decent hike.

We picked the hotel after reading reviews in some travel books, and then reading all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor. When our cab dropped us off at the hotel, we were quite impressed- the web pictures really don't do the hotel justice. Our room was lovely- with large european windows overlooking the street. And the room was nice and cold! Helped with the 35 degree weather. We really had no complaints about the room- except when we were looking for a box of kleenex and couldn't find one- but then a box appeared a couple days later. That's a bit nit picky, I guess. Honestly, our room was a great refuge after very long days in the heat. The breakfast at the hotel was perfect. We sat on the terrace each morning, and had our pick of everything you could imagine- fruit, yogurt, cereals, pastries, hard boiled eggs, fresh juices, meats and cheeses, and a nice pot of cofee. I looked forward to breakfast every day. The hotel put all of the newspapers in the breakfast room, whereas I might have delivered a paper to each room...guarantees you get a paper that way. The service, more importantly, was outstanding. The staff was very fun- always smiling, and very helpful. They booked us tours, helped us with restaurant choices, and indulged us whenever possible. We ate lunch several times at the hotel bar- which was a better lunch than we found elsewhere in Rome. I'd recommend the Celio Salad. My husband was a fan of the spinach salad. It was really nice to unwind there with a glass of Pinot Grigio. Didn't get a chance to check out the gym...but who needs to when you're walking everywhere. Oh- and the location was fantastic. The colisseum is at the end of the street! Granted, there aren't the same shops and restaurants as other parts of town, but they are only minutes away and fun to explore on an evening out anyway. And...we found we kept going back to Ancient Rome for so many of the sights, that we were lucky to be staying so close.

The only problem we had was not with the Capo but with a tour booked through them with VASTOURS. The Vatican tour was terrible.

This was our first trip to Europe, and we couldn\u2019t have dreamed up a better hotel than this for our last week in Europe. We picked it mostly because of the favorable Tripadvisor reviews. The location is ideal for visiting the Colosseum, the Forum, Capitoline Museum, Piazza Campidoglio, Domus Aurea, Trajan\u2019s Market, and San Pietro in Vincola. Our room, a standard double, was comparable to a room in any luxury hotel in Manhattan or San Francisco and included thick robes and slippers. The bathroom had an American sized tub, copious marble throughout, a bidet, and high quality fixtures (Grohe). The only English channels on TV were CNN and BBC, but we did get current updates of the Red Sox\u2019 first World Series championship since 1918 (not being able to watch any of the post season games being my only regret of this trip). The breakfast room has a rooftop terrace, and sitting on the terrace while looking at the Colosseum, sipping a sublime hot chocolate, and sampling from a huge assortment of breakfast goodies, including croissants and various sweet pastries, eggs, cold cuts, cheese, fruit, cereals, juices, and breads is an experience not to be missed. As far as facilities, there\u2019s an outstanding workout room in the basement, and the lobby level bar is a great place to chill out with a martini before dinner. There are several ristorantes, trattorias, and pizzerias in the neighborhood, and we enjoyed Isidoro in particular. The hotel\u2019s bartender, Adolfo, made reservations for us at a seafood ristorante a few blocks away, which was superb. Also, Trattoria di Naumachie, about a block away, was very good. There\u2019s an internet caf\u00e9 about a block and half away, a grocery store about the same distance, and a terrific gelateria a half block from the internet caf\u00e9. As far as transportation beyond walking distance, there are bus and trolley stops on via Celio Vibenna. Bus and trolley maps are available in the newsstands on the same street, which make it really easy to figure out how to get where you want to go. There\u2019s also a Metro stop across from the Colosseum on via dei Fori Imperiali. If room rates hadn\u2019t gone up so much since 2004, we\u2019d probably stay here again. But at current prices we can find other hotels closer to the center of town (ie closer to Piazza Navona, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Campo dei Fiori, Spanish Steps, and Vatican City). So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ll be back in Rome this coming October/November, and we\u2019ll be staying between Piazza Venezia and Piazza Campo dei Fiori.

As far as restaurants are concerned, like many other reviewers we found Le Naumarchie to be the best in the immediate area, although they did not have tables outside unlike many of the other restaurants, the food was of a higher quality and there was a good choice. We were surprised at how cheaply we could eat out around the hotel. Our experience of the pizzeria next door to Le Naumarchie (think it was called Lucca) was not a good one, there were a lot of locals there which made us think it would be good, but the lasagne certainly wasn't great, the service was awful and the wine dreadful, one couple were even seated next to a drainpipe and the crates containing empty drinks bottles! We arranged our transport to and from the airport through Viatours by taking a shuttle, cost for the two of us \u00a337.20 return which was far cheaper than taking a taxi, although we had to drop a couple of people off first on the way there which took a bit longer, at least we saw a bit more of Rome and coming back we had the service to ourselves.

The neighbourhood is a real Roman neighbourhood which is becoming trendy. It has some very good restaurants and charming cafes, which are not overwhelmed by tourists. I also had some of the best gelato that I have had in Italy in the neighbourhood. The hotel is close to the Coliseum, Palatine Hill and the Forum. Strongly recommended as well is a visit to the less crowded San Clemente church just around the corner which has fascinating archeological excavations beneath it.

The hotel and its rooms are pretty, really nicely designed, and are clean and well thought out. Don't expect huge rooms, but do expect comfort and style. The bathroom was small, but had a great shower cubicle. If you need to relax and stretch out, head up to the beautiful roof terrace and order a drink. The service was on the whole excellent, particularly the welcome on arrival.

Instead, we bought a 3-day unlimited Metro pass which only cost Euro 11. It's about a 10-minute walk from the hotel to the nearest metro stop Colesseo. The hotel was tastfully docorated and so was our room (103). It was in a quiet location. The real noise actually came from the cleaning ladies who were talking very loudly in the corridor one afternoon while we're taking a nap. The front desk staff were friendly except for one lady who seemed to be serving with an attitude. The buffet breakfast had a good selection and kept us full for at least half a day. The two ladies serving in the breakfast room were warm and friendly and made good cappucinos. Room service was efficient too. The staff came in split seconds right after we called. We have read reviews about the beds being too hard but we actually found them to be very comfortable. The pillows were a bit soft though. I also remembered someone writing about the toilet paper not being soft enough. The hotel has actually made improvements on that front. I couldn't say enough good things about their shower facilities - the water pressure was very powerful. We couldn't wait to try Le Naumachie before the trip after reading all the reviews that raved about the restaurant. We ended up having dinners there for four straight nights as they had demonstrated good quality, good quantity and was very reasonably priced. I truly missed their pastas!

My second visit to Rome in 17 years. The staff is welcoming, very helpful and attentive. My friend and I booked a Superior Twin Room however when we arrived, the room was a Double. The hotel was fully booked but the receptionist immediately ordered for an extra bed to be carried in the room, no hassle. The decor of the lobby is clean and modern but the room could have been (especially the curtains and the carpet)a little updated. Nonetheless the bathrooms were kept spotlessly clean, although on the smaller side with no ventilators so had to open up the windows after taking a bath. A tip if you are taking the hideous Roman taxis from the Termini. You will be surrounded by illegal drivers so beware--look for the licensed city signs printed on their car and check for the meters, if any of it is lacking, DO NOT GET IN. The taxi sign at the station will guide you straight to these guys so do not trust the signs ignore it! Those drivers will even tell terrible lies to you that a huge demo is going on in Rome (yes, suddenly )so I should not ride the metro and so on. Since Paris was on my mind (was there a week ago before entering Rome) I chose that cab. I was charged 30 Euros for a 5 minute drive and the driver was probably too scared to be busted(I complained) so did not pull up outside the hotel but left me about 100 metres away from it. The hotel receptionist told me the ride should have been 12 Euros or so AND THERE WAS NO SUCH DEMO. Anyway, my friend was also charged 80 Euros from the Airport to the hotel which seemed too expensive. We were feeling terrible so asked the hotel to book a nice restaurant nearby which turned out to be excellent. The next day we chose a restaurant on our own around the Colosseum that charged us too much (not only us but the people around were complaining too) so as for my recommendation, just stick to what the hotel recommends and do not go beyond that...

Word of warning.....when using a taxi make sure you see the drivers 'registration number' (on the back seat of the driver/passenger seat) and keep an eye on them to make sure they aren't discretely fiddling the meter. Secondly beware of drivers pulling up at the side of the road asking you for directions and then offering you a free gift e.g. an 'Armani rep' offering leather coats - believe me the gift is not free and definitely not Armani, they tend to get aggressive when you refuse. We found some of the Romans to be very aggressive and were subject to bad language a couple of times in the street - although they are obviously fluent in English and certainly know all of the swear words!!!!

You can book a taxi to the airport (Leonardo da Vinci) at reception for 50Euro - well worth it as the other option is taxi to the station and then train to the airport. The train costs 19Euro for 2 people. The taxi ride to the airport only took about 20 minutes. One day we took a taxi to the Vatican / St Peters and walked back via the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, shops and restaurants . It took us most of the day as we kept stopping to admire the fabulous buildings (and to eat pizza and drink Barolo!) but was fantastic. Don't miss the Vatican museum!

Situated just 5 minutes walk from the Metro subway station and 2 minutes walk from the Colloseum (where you can conveniently jump on, and off, the circular open-topped tourist bus if you buy a day ticket (13 Euros)) the Capo d'Africa hotel is located at the end of a quiet street. The building is beautiful from the outside and right next to it is an ancient Roman building, full of character. The quiet streets nearby have a few bars, restaurants and cafes on them and there's also a bank autotellar machine and pharmacy. Our double room (108), on the ground floor was very spacious with a separate hall containing a fitted cupboard (with safe) and a separate bathroom with a really-powerful shower - perfect for easing your weary muscles after a hard day's sight-seeing. Nice extras like complimentary toiletries, rooms slippers and towelling robe help add to your comfort. The staff, without exception, were cheery, friendly, extremely helpful (without being 'in your face') and spoke perfect English. When we were shown our room, a few items from the previous guests were still in there but this was dealt with swiftly and with much apology and it really wasn't a problem. Everything had been cleaned and the room was spotless. Breakfast was served in a light and airy room on the fourth floor which has outdoor seating on the terrace with a view of the Colloseum over the rooftops. As we were there in January, this terrace wasn't used for meals but you could go outside to admire the view. Breakfast was great - choice of fresh fruit juices, cereals, yoghurts, fresh fruit, pastries, cold meat, cheeses, breads, boiled eggs and choice of coffee, tea or cappucino brought to your table! Perfectly adequate and everything was fresh and tasty. Only quibbles about the hotel would be that you only have CNN and Sky News as free English-speaking channels on the TV but you have better things to do in Rome - or in your hotel room - than watch TV, let's face it! You can walk to the Piazza Venezia, in the centre of Rome - with the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Pantheon and many other attractions within ten minutes' walking distance - within fifteen minutes of leaving the hotel. And it's a lovely walk, too, straight down from the Colloseum down past the Roman Forum ruins - what history!

Great Hotel. My wife and I first visit to Rome. Hotel is bery nicely decorated inside and out. Very stylish and chic. Room was modern, mid sized, with a queen bed. Bathroom had a nice size tub with a shower and a bidet. Staff was fairly friendly, by Roman standards, which means they do not fall over themselves to be attentive. Exception was the front desk person Ciara. She was a doll. Always smiling, very warm. Breakfast Buffet was typical Roman style. Cheeses, slice cold meats,(Turkey, Salami, Ham, good quality) boiled eggs, Bread,(sliced bread, rolls, packaged toast), fresh sliced fruit, Great Pastries, and cereal, juice, and yogart. Nice selection. You also get cofee, although if you want more than one cup you have to chase down the server. The city of Room requires hotels to turn off the A/C on Nov 15th. This hotel did turn their's off on Nov 3rd without notice so the room became hot and I woke up in the middle of the night since the A/C was blowing out warm air. They could have told us so I would have opened the window and turned off the A/C unit. The bed was a bit firm, no bounce at all, and the hair blow drier was installed in the tummy drawer of the desk by the bed, which meant we had to pull the curly cord out of the desk drawer while sitting down drying our hair and the drawer kept on springing open, which was funny and annoying at the same time. The hotel is located a few blocks off the Colosseo so if you like ancient ruins this is the place for you. If you are looking for shopping ie Spanish Steps area, or fountains, like Trevi or markets like Campio de Fiori, it is a bit of a hike from the hotel or about 10 Eur by taxi. They are very good about calling one. 5 min wait every time. Overall we paid 200 Eur a night including taxes for 6 nights and I felt it was a good deal.

The room was a good size with a huge queen sized double and a z-bed for our son. The room was cleaned every day plus a turn down service in the early evening. Yes, our bathroom was small but the shower was double size and powerful and anyway what do you need acres of space in there for anyway!? Reception staff where more than friendly at all times with a ciao or bon jorno each time we came in or went out. I must say that having a 5 year old son in Rome is like having a golden ticket, Italians love children and will bend over backwards to help you. People gave up there seats on the metro and were very welcoming everywhere we went. I think it helped by using polite greetings, thankyou's etc in italian. This courtesy seemed to be very appreciated, note we had never spoken Italian or been to Italy before this trip. All the sites are reachable on foot, though you will need to be fit to cover everything. We used the Metro which costs only 1 Euro to reach the Spanish Steps (15 mins door to door) and Vatican (25 mins). Walking back via Pantheon, Trevi Fountain then along the Forum to the Colloseum was a delight. We did this day and night, e.g. after eating at Edy's near Spanish Steps we walked back at 11 o'clock at night, via the floodlit Trevi in around half an hour. We felt safe the whole time and did not encounter any trouble on the whole trip. Bare in mind I wouldn't walk around my native Newcastle at night with my 5 year old!! We took a taxi (arranged by reception, came in 5 mins) to Piazza Navona at 10 Euros then had dinner at Tre Scalini. Soaked up the atmosphere of the piazza (very Covent Garden) then strolled back via The Pantheon, again about 35 - 40 mins as a slow walk, including ice creams. The best pizza tratoria we found in Rome happened to be 50 yards from the Hotel, just around the corner! Le Namouche (not exact spelling) was full of italians, atmosphere and good cheap food. Thanks to an earlier reviewer who recommended this place! Rome felt safer than any other city I've been to, though it has more tourist scammers than any. Flower sellers, fake designer label sellers, fake gladiators charging 10 Euros each for a picture taken on your own camera, etc. Don't make eye contact and don't accept anything 'free'. Ignore them though and they dont hassle you. This year we have been lucky enough to visit Nice, Paris, Geneva, London, Boston and now Rome.

Having stayed in a number of hotels in Rome and other capital cities the capo gives you an oasis of calm. The rooms have excellent soundproofing, great air-conditioning and plenty of facilities and space if you are using the hotel as a base for exploring this incredible city and do not intend to be closeted in your room for much of the day. The breakfast is great with a fabulous choice and one half of the patio does look over the coliseum, obviously not everyone can sit in the prime positions but is this not the case in any facility. The capo is a modern designed hotel which does have a bar area for drinks plus it has a fabulous roof terrace which can be used for dining and has waiter service until 12.midnight. Indeed my one complaint is that this is not highlighted more, as we were usually the only guest using the terrace on our stay. I found the service excellent at all times with the desk and bar always staffed with English speaking assistants, though maybe the night porter may not have been fluent it is surely not in his job description and the night desk manager was always present when we returned. Indeed as we were travelling independently the staff spent ages sorting out our train journey to Sorrento. The location is surprisingly quite given its vicinity to the coliseum and is surrounded by some fabulous local restaurants which are packed with locals. Of course if you want to eat opposite the coliseum then be prepared to be exploited as a tourist just like anywhere else in the world. Admittedly the hotel is not bang in the middle of the main tourist destinations but you can get a tube from outside the coliseum (about 1/2 mile away) costing 1 or 2 euros and get off at the Spanish steps and walk back to the hotel via the trevi, pantheon, piazza navone, etc (sorry about the spellings).

It was literally a 3 minute walk to the Colisseum and a leisurely walk or short bus ride away from all the main attractions. Although this was a fairly expensive Hotel you had the benefit of some lovely tratorrias just around the corner from the hotel which were unbelievably well priced considering everyone had said how expensive Rome is. The Naumecherie for one was excellent, we had 2 main courses, a bottle of house red, a bottle of water and a basket of bread all for 20 euros and it was delicious authentic Italian cuisine. When we ate nearer to the tourist spots the food was very basic but twice the above price. So the money we paid for the hotel was balanced by the cheap but splendid restaurants nearby. The hotel itself was clean and beautiful with extremely good rooms and helpful staff. The breakfast was continental with a great choice of breads, cheeses, meats, cereals, yoghurts, fruit, pastries etc. And what better way to start your day than to eat on the roof terrace surrounded by lemon trees with the Roman sum beating down. My one bit of advice for a visit to Rome is to beware the taxi drivers. We got a taxi to the theatre from our hotel and it was 20 euros, the same journey back was only 6!!! He'd taken us around the houses obviously so he could rip us off. Note that the Hotel provides a car which will take you to the airport for 50 euros so you haven't got the worry of being ripped off. We only found this out by accident but were relieved that we didn't have to be subjected to the Grand Turismo journey we'd endured on the way. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Can't wait to go back - we shall be trying to stay in Room 308 at the Capo D' Africa!! I need that chocolate croissant, and delicious pot of coffee whilst gazing at the Colosseum!

We were running late but the reception (Chiara) rang the restaurant to let them know we were late and also printed off directions to the restaurant so we could find it.

Breakfast was excellent although my only comment is that no-one at the hotel told us we could also order dinner there (as we would certainly have eaten there). Location was fantastic. 5 minutes walk to the Colosseum and Metro station. 117 bus stop (which takes you to Via Del Corso - the main shopping street and all the tourist sights) around the corner from the hotel.

Yes I have been in others with better breakfast and cheaper drinks, these two small issues apart the hotel is superb and if you are unsure about whether to book or not, then have no fear - go for it. The hotel is located at the far end of a street that leads directly to the Forum and The Coloseum. The location is quiet and in our time there we encountered no unsavoury characters at all. The staff are excellent, especially the desk staff and nothing is any trouble. They even greet you warmly when you return from a hard day sightseeing. The rooms are quite big for a city hotel and are spotlessly clean as are the bathrooms. Are there any downsides? Well, not really, at least not any that would make me even consider not going back. The breakfast is typically European, juices, cereal, pastries, fruit, cheese, yoghurt, tea/coffee (fresh)cold meats, bread and jam. Now this list looks quite long, but if you are used to a large 'traditional' Irish/British breakfast, well it will take you a little while to get into the Italian swing of things. The Breakfast Room has a very nice outside terrace. Perhaps the staff could replace the items that are most popular a little faster, but really that is a very trivial criticism. My only gripe is the price of the drinks. I'm sorry but no dram of non-specialised after dinner drink is worth 9 Euro, no matter the hotel. That said drinks in the bar are often served with dishes of olives, nuts and other nibbles. In spite of what I said about the price, if you go, be sure to take a night cap on the terrace at the back, it really is atmospheric especially with the candles and old convent buildings that overlook the terrace. I saw the hotel here on TripAdvisor and everything that was said was true. I saw a bargain on a web based site but phoned the hotel to check if I could have a third bed in the room for my daughter. The person said of course I could and that she could also offer a special rate that undercut the already good web rate by a further 20%. So, be sure to get the best rate you can on the net and thn give them a call, you never know your luck. I found the area a little less well served for restaurants than others have suggested. The pizzas served at Trattoria Luzzi are for nothing, and if you can accept the less than sumptuous surroundings then after a long day it can be a very nice place to go for a simple pizza and delicious bruscetta. Another restaurant Il Buccincino cost about 200Euro for 6 people with all courses, three bottles of wine, 2 bottles of water and some beer. There is a nice ice cream parlour one streep up (Via Marco Aurelia) and it serves about 40 flavours. A Taxi ride to the Vatican is about 12 Euro, and that is probably as far as you will want to take a taxi. A taxi to the airport is about 50 Euro, however the Hotel can organise a large taxi for groups of 6 (90 Euro) or 8 (100 Euro). All in all Capo D'Africa is a knock out.

The white wine was charged to us at 33 euros so it was a little extorionist. Apart from these two little misunderstandings we loved the hotel and would reccomend it to others.

My wife and I just got back from a 5-night stay. We have been in four European hotels within the past six years (Paris twice, London, Rome), and Capo d'Africa was the best hands down. It was a delight to come back to the hotel after a tough day of walking, and walking, and walking. My wife \"folded\" a number of times during the stay, and we had to spend more time in the room than I would have liked. The room was so nice that the lost sightseeing time was tolerable. I think that you'll find the location of the hair dryer interesting. We really liked the firm mattress. As nice as this place is, keep in mind that we're all comparing it to the typical European hotel. I would put this hotel in the Holiday Inn category in terms of quality. If I came back to Rome, I'm not sure I would book this hotel again, due to its location. I say that only because of my wife, who was reluctant (and complaining) to walk the two miles, or so, to places like Piazza Navona and the Spanish Steps. For me, that was no problem, and I liked the \"roaming around\" process. For someone who doesn't like to walk, the metro doesn't necessarily solve the problem because it is not extensive like the one in Paris. Further, the \"A\" Line is being shut down rather early at night (9:00 to 10:00 pm) for repairs. We got caught with that problem after eating at the Hard Rock Cafe late one night. The metro shut down, so we had to walk the 2.5 miles back to the hotel (I did no previous study of the bus system, so we didn't mess with it).

There are also a number of parks and open spaces near by to have a morning/evening walk around. Having breakfast on the sun terrace every morning was a bonus - you can even see the coliseum in the distance. the breakfast was substantial and you can have it from 6.30 to 11am.

Stayed here for a long weekend for my birthday, and I really don't see what you could complain about. Having stayed at hotels all around the world, Capo D Africa is up there with the good ones. The reception / bar area downstairs looks great, neutral colours, dark wood and polished surfaces. If you like tradtional hotels this may not be for you, but that is a matter of taste. Room on second floor was impressive, not huge, but with modern decor and lovely bathroom this did not matter. Everything in the hotel was spotlessly clean. Our room was at the back (216) and overlooked what seemed to be residential flats, but there was no noise from them. It is a residential area, but having never been to Rome before I would HIGHLY recommend it. I suppose the location is a pro or con depending on the individual, as it is probably a 15-20 min walk ( all flat ) to the Sp Steps. We were so glad to be out of the city centre as it can be (like all big cities) noisy and crowded. You can walk to most areas of interest quickly and easily,( Colisseum is 3 mins, Roman Forum 5). I think the furthest is probably the Vatican and that is still maybe 30 mins. You could easily eat locally in the evening as the local restaurants look excellent and are not the high prices you pay for eating in the tourist areas. There are also a few bars, a pharmacy, supermarket etc locally so you would not need to venture far if you needed anything. Reception staff are very helpful, and were very accomodating if we needed anything. One point I would note, (and this is not a criticism but an observation,) is that they do not allow irons in the room, so you would either have to iron everything before you go and hope its still wearable, or pay for laundry service - I think its about 7 euros for a shirt. As I said, it not a criticism, but as a fussy girl, I like all my clothes be ironed when I get there! Another tip, we flew into Ciampino, and were overcharged on our taxi by about 20 euros. The hotel will book them for you for a 50 euro flat rate ( including tips etc) so if you want a taxi transfer it may be best to contact the hotel directly rather than rely upon the honesty of locals!

During my next visit to Rome I would consider other alternatives first. One upset had to do with the housekeeping staff - they were loud and extremely noisy in cleaning the rooms. Each morning it felt as though I had woken up in the middle of a construction site! I tried several times to communicate to them how I did not want to be bothered until a specific time (around noon), and to not come and clean my room any earlier than that. My efforts failed. They would buzz my door at around 9-9:30 AM and then simply enter while I was still in bed. One time the same thing happened much earlier at 7:45 AM. I will say that they are very intrusive, and did not help make my stay any comfortable. An odd cleaning agent is used on the elevator which smells like crap, literally. My room was small and not all areas had been completely cleaned. On my first day when I began unpacking, I laid out some of my clothes into the closet, only to later find out that it was filled with dust which left many stains on my clothing. Instead of relaxing, I spent my evening before bed doing laundry. It is a common understanding that European hotel rooms are not as large, but for the money I spent I expected much more, especially considering I had reserved a deluxe room. I would advise future guests to avoid getting a room on the third floor under the breakfast room - you will find that the area is not well insulated and footsteps from the people above can be heard, along with the screeching of chairs being dragged forward and back. Also, if you look at the floor's safety plan layout you can get somewhat an idea of how large your room is... apparently I was put in the smallest one. None of the rooms really have a view of anything, with the exception of the Junior Suite which slightly overlooks the Colloseum. There is limited television programming, with about 10 Italian channels and two in English (MTV/CNN). PayTV is available but only 4 movies play constantly throughout the day, reception on these channels were also not too good. \u20ac12 I paid gone to waste. Breakfast on the other hand was something I was actually pleased with. There are enough pastries, breads and meats/hams to fill you up. Various juices are available, although a tad warm after sitting out for so long. Go ahead and ask for a cappuccino as it should be included in the breakfast rate. Front desk staff can be quite helpful, and are kind and welcoming. Any time I brought in a late night super or snack the bartender was able to provide me with cutlery and ice. Use of the minibar is expensive, room service prices are perhaps average. The location of the hotel itself is convenient; 4 blocks from the Coloseum and just a bit further ahead is the Colosseo Metro station (which comes 2 stops after the Termini station). Restaurants are close by within the surrounding blocks of the hotel. I ate at a few of them but would recommend going closer into the historical centre of the city to eat. Two 'supermarkets' are in the vicinity. One of them is called GS and you can get prepared sandwiches there for less than \u20ac2. No other shops of much interest for me to mention (the area is mostly residential), but be careful when you cross the street as the area becomes busy at times. Watch where you walk as there will often be some droppings left by dog owners on the sidewalk. Despite all the problems I had with the hotel I wouldn't completely rule out staying here again, and would still offer it as a recommendation to others. Just make sure to complain when something goes wrong. The hotel Capo d'Africa is again a decent place, they have to continue to work on improvements however. From my experience I cannot support its 4 star ranking.", "Date": "February 8, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Very Positive Experience\u201d", "Author": "caviargal", "ReviewID": "UR3160117", "Content": "We stayed here for 2 nights in late January.

The location is fantastic. It is tucked away in a little corner just blocks from the Colloseum, which made it quiet. The outside of the hotel is beautiful. Every inner city attraction is within walking distance and the Metro is on the other side of the Colloseum. You can walk to any part of Rome within the Roman wall very easily (just take your time, like the last reviewer said) The restaurants in the area are all great. Check out the Royal House, in front of the Colloseum for homemade pasta and if you want a great pizza check out the Pizza Forum, just two streets over from the hotel. We would definately stay here again, if we return. We had relatives staying in other hotels during our stay and none were located in such a great spot as this one and not as clean.

It was very important that we stayed somewhere nice because I'd read several reviews of bad hotels in Rome on Tripadvisor so we decided that we'd pay a little extra to make sure our trip wasn't ruined by a dodgy hotel. Well, to be honest, its not that much more expensive and judging from some of the bad experiences people have had elsewhere, its well worth it. The Capo D'Africa is a lovely hotel situated at the far end of a street right opposite the Colosseum - and that's a sight for sore, weary eyes when you see it lit up at night - stunning!! The hotel is very tastefully furnished with lots of pieces of modern art, minimal but still not too bare. The staff were very friendly and only too happy to help - for instance the porter, on our way to check out on Monday, insisted on wheeling my suitcase for me the short way to reception! Our room was spacious with a wonderful view of the very old tower across the road and every morning while we were at breakfast, the Room Fairy came to tidy our room up for us and replenish our stocks of soap and shower gel. We even had our own bathrobe and slippers to wear. Breakfast was a buffet style affair and it would've been nice to sit out on the terrace but unfortunately the weather wasn't too special. However, we still enjoyed breakfast so that didn't matter. The hotel is perfectly situated for those who don't mind a walk, and really, its not far to the Colosseum and the Forum, other things take a little longer but there are so many lovely things to see, you don't notice the walk.

I must admit at first I thought that while it was a very nice boutiquish hotel, I could not understand all the hype but as we walked about Rome and I saw other hotels in the area, I immediately understood and was greatful that we had chosen Capo D Africa for our stay. Very very highly recommended... I do want to add a word about one of the reviews below that accused the hotel of overbooking...it is telling that that Out of 63 reviews only one mentioned this problem and while I understand the posters frustration, I think it extremely unfair to assume that the hotel as a whole regularly overbooks simply because it happened once. I would think there would be several posts stating the same if it were in fact a regular practice of the hotel...okay got that off my chest....if you are looking for a stylish hotel central to the sights, this is an excellent choice.

However, it is tucked away at the end of a very quiet street, which means restful nights away from traffic, noise and crowds.

We were given a very large corner room that had 12 foot ceilings and four huge windows (including one in the bathroom right beside the tub!). It was very comfortably furnished, immaculately clean, and included excellent amenities (plush robes, terry slippers, premium bath products, luxurious towels). The airconditioning worked beautifully!!! Which was very important given our condition when we returned to our room after trekking around the city for hours on end in 34 degree heat!

By the way I fully recommend getting a tour guide for the Colliseum because you get to cut the longest line in the history of the world, plus the tour includes the Forum. You do not need a guide for the catacombs, when you get there one is provided with your entrance and a cab ride is only like 10 euros. The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, Campo di Fiori are all a 5 minute cab ride away and all within walking distance from one another. You cannot go wrong with this hotel.
