It was a nice clean hotel and the lobby is very nicely appointed. The breakfast at this hotel was wonderful. I was expecting something much less than what we got. The bathroom is very small but still nice and clean. Some of the down falls are that the walls are paper thin. I could hear whole conversations going on in the next room. Also, the electricity left a little to be desired. I had brought my curling iron and a converter and it never did get hot enough to use. It was lukewarm at best. When walking in the corridor, sometimes the lights would go off for a few seconds- I think they may have been on a timer. The last complaint I had was that I could not get the phone to work properly to call internationally. One thing that was different for me but I gather is somewhat standard- you have to put your room key in a slot on the wall to get the electricity to stay on in the room.

The hotel is nice and modern and with free wifi and breakfast included, its a good place to stay. The journey into the city centre will take between 15-30 mins depending on where you are going. (Vatican is 20 mins away). Travel tips from Fiumicino : Train will cost \u20ac8 each, buses are \u20ac4 each. Dont buy a bus ticket in the terminal - go to the terminal, and buy it there because you will get onto a Terravision bus quicker. Go to Termini and from here there are a few options: Get the Metro to Lepanto. Then get the 913 towards Stz MonteMario and get off at the right stop (check a map). Get the Metro to Cipro. Come out of the station and head towards the main junction by the fountain. Here you can get a taxi to the hotel (about \u20ac10), or go onto Via Trianfole for about 150m to the first bus stop and get either 907, 913, 990, 991. Try to get a bus map online or as soon as you get to a tourist information centre or alike.. buses are the way to travel in Rome as the Metro only has 2 lines.

The staff here are absolutely amazing. The cleaning staff are very good at their jobs, and always smile and say hello when they see you. The breakfast staff are very efficient. And the receptionists are the best I have ever encountered. They all go above and beyond to help you. Gianpaolo was lovely! Always very polite, excellent at his job, and also very funny! Monica was fantastic and was very helpful in booking my visit to the Borghese Gallery. And another lady whose name I did not catch was wonderful! She went above and beyond to help me find out about the Epiphany celebrations at the Vatican, and was such a lovely, pleasant woman!!! And all the other reception staff were fantastic also. Always had a smile on their face and a hello on their lips. When I asked for another room the receptionists didn't hesitate to find me one, and I was moved within 10 minutes. I have not got a bad word to say about the staff here. They are simply the best. The hotel itself is very modern, clean, and spacious. It's surroundings are absolutely beautiful!! When you first get to Rome it is a bit of a challenge finding it. I strongly suggest looking at it on google earth. You can't see the hotel, but it shows you the opening of the road it is on, which will help tremendously. If I hadn't googled it, I would not have got off at the right stop. The best way I think to get there when you first arrive is to get to Termini from wherever you have come from, get the metro line A to Cipro, and when you come out of Cipro metro station take the stairs to your left, and then go left again and there is a small bus depo on your right. Catch the 907 and keep looking to your left. The stop to get off at is Trifonale - Scolopi. If you are unsure, ask the bus driver. They were always very helpful for me, although I never encountered one that spoke English, so have your phrasebook at the ready. When you are going from the hotel into Rome the buses 913 and 907 are probably the best. The 913 takes to to the Mausoleum of Augstus which is on Via di Ripetta, and is just a short street away from Via del Corso, which is the main street in Rome, and you can get to most everywhere from it. The 907 takes you to Cipro metro station where you can catch the metro to pretty much everywhere. Be warned though! The buses are normally packed with locals!! I strongly suggest that you choose this hotel because it was quite simply wonderful, and the staff here are amazing.

We paid \u00a340 per night for our room, including breakfast, and were located a comfortable distance from the centre of Rome - a bargin! The hotel is extremely clean and tidy and has modern and tasteful decor throughout the communal areas. The outside terrance is lovely and surrounded by countryside, although it was too cold to enjoy in December! Our room was incredibly basic - a welcome pack of menus, phone numbers ect would have been appreciated, as would tea and coffee making facilities. However, we paid for a basic room - the slightly more expensive rooms looked lovely. Our room was cleaned daily, and we has fresh sheets and towels each time. I was basic, but it was adequate - you're in Rome, you will not be spending much time in the room! The restaurant was lovely. The food was some of the best we had during our time in Rome and the waiting staff were helpful, attentive and polite. The breakfast buffet wasn't fantastic, but was adequate and we certainly didn't go hungry. The reception staff were also very polite and helpful, assisting us when we lost the key to our case and providing helpful information about bus routes and the local area. The hotel is located a short walk from a bus stop that takes you straight to the centre of Rome - it's about a 30 minute bus journey but is only 4euros for a 24 hour bus ticket. In all, I would certainly stay at the hotel again.

I feel that the problems we encountered could be rectified with the appropriate attitude. The GM (Monica) listened to our problems and upgraded our room,but I feel she needs a team to work alongside her,which unfortunately she doesn't have. We complained about several issues including noisy guests running up and down on the landing to our room which wasn't cleaned properly.Hence, dirty cups were left the following day, and toiletries and especially toilet paper. Also, they have a 'Do not disturb button' on the outside of the room, but is totally ignored by staff,as on christmas day when we wanted to be left alone, we were asked twice if they could clean our room. The most upsetting incident for us though as a family,was that when we went down to have our christmas evening meal together, the waitress who I must add is the only member of staff who smiles and makes you feel welcome, completely messed the dinner up. I ordered fish and was served a plate of lamb (which i don't eat). And at this point my children had eaten and finished, so I ended up not having a Christmas meal with them. On the whole and to summarise my review, the Hotel is a very grand building which could look and feel better, if the staff in the establishment made it feel more welcoming and made more of an effort.

We couldn't fault our accommodation it was 5 Star as can be seen on the professional photos provided by the hotel. The food and service was of a very high standard. Breakfast was varied and we even used the restaurant one evening, again I would give 5 Stars for very traditional Italian menu. You would have to pay at least an extra \u00a3200 to get the same quality in the city centre for a 3 night break. Taxi from Airport would have been \u00a385, well worth it if you don't want the fuss of working out what train to get. We took the train and taxi, saving \u00a350 (albeit very confusing) 3 days travel on the buses and metro only cost \u00a311 each, great to get you to the main attractions. Opposite the Termini metro station is a open top bus tour operator. This is a must and a great experience. The hop on hop off facility made planning each day easy. Don't let the distance from the city put you off this Hotel. If you want a decent nights sleep in superior comfort at an affordable price and make your spending money go further, then this is a great choice. CONS - Whilst we were happy to travel daily by bus and metro to the City, it does take a day to get used to the travel routine. The trip to the city can take up to 30 minutes on a bad day in each direction. USEFUL TIPS: Fumichino Airport - Get the Express Train to Rome Termini only 30 minutes then get the Metro from Termini to the Cipro station using the main A line (RED) Catch the 901 or 913 to Montemario (probably best to get the taxi the first time from Cipro) When you book the open tour bus, pre-book and pay for the Vatican and Colloseum in advance, you don't need to queue on the day. MAPS Mmm - Street signs are not illuminated at night, it's easy to get lost after dark. Use a sat nav on your phone. No public toilets, but don't be afraid to ask in restaurants as the locals are very friendly.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mill town", "Title": "\u201cNice break\u201d", "Author": "Tartanteaser", "ReviewID": "UR119048179", "Content": "The hotel is very pleasant though quite a distance from the city. We made our daily journey into Rome part of the experience. We used the 913 bus from just around the corner and that took us right into the city's main attractions- journey time varied from 20 to 30 minutes depending on traffic and the buses were quite frequent. I would not advise anyone to drive into the city- Rome's motorists are nut-cases! At 1 Euro the bus journey was inexpensive! (We booked a taxi for 4 when we were going back to the airport- a journey which took 40 mins- the hotel receptionist was very helpful- and we got it at 40 Euro which was cheaper than we could find online!) Rooms are adequate and quite comfortable though dated- however the shower was a joke! One of our party is 6'4\" and was unable to turn around in the shower as he kept turning the tap off whenever he moved! Upgrade if you can as there are better rooms available. Breakfast was fine with plenty to eat and a decent selection. We ate in the restaurant one evening- service was a little slow as there were only two staff waiting tables- however the food when it arrived was as good as we got in the city. It was our friends birthday during our stay and the manager sent up to their room a chilled bottle of bubbly with strawberries and canap\u00e9s which was a lovely touch The pool area is nice but unfortunately was closed when we were there as it was 'out of season' Refreshments at the bar were reasonably priced and we found all the staff to be polite and friendly.

The area around the hotel offers no entertainment value.

Lets start the hotel and its grounds are lovely to look at and walk around, nicely decorated and really clean with no rubbish lying around the downside is that when you arrive at the hotel you have to climb quite a few steps (photo included) so not so good with a heavy suitcase. The reception staff were pleasant and helpful so no problems there. After seeing the hotel we were looking forward to seeing our room, what a shock we got, it was very basic and dated, cigerette burns everywhere. TV that had no English channels, mini bar with nothing in it a broken safe and bathroom that when you have a shower and you open the shower doors you have to sit on the loo to get out. The bed had a very dodgy blanket on it and myself and my husband received many bites which we believe came from the bed. They dont show you this room on the website. The hotel does provide free wi-fi but you must get passcode and login from reception. Breakfasts for me was very good toast, yogurts, cereals, cheese and fruit juice for my husband not so good scrambled eggs really slimy olive oil added to stop it drying out and it was the same for the bacon. There was also prunes, cold meats, cake, tea, coffee water and croissants. We did not try the restaurant as the menu was limited. The hotel pool is lovely and i really reccomend that you spend some time here, the pool is really clean with nice sun loungers, we did,nt have a problem getting a bed either. If the bedroom in the hotel matched the rest of the hotel i would have given it 4 stars overall but the premier inn (Manchester airport) that we had stayed in before we flew was 100 percent better. Also unless you are prepared to use public transport or pay 20 euros for a taxi each way the hotel is far away from the city centre. HINTS AND TIPS 1 Bus and metro travel is very cheap a 1 euro ticket allows you 1 metro trip and as many bus journeys you can manage in 75 mins this is the important bit buy tickets in bulk as you can not buy them on the bus and the kiosks are hard to find. we bought ours at the tabbaconist near hotel (good 10 mins walk) at the end of the lane turn right walk till you see church go right again and its at the end of the road. 907 bus takes you to Cipro metro station which is right next to the Vatican city. Approx 20 min bus ride. 2 buy your water at Carrefour 6 bottles1.20 euros, hotel 1 bottle 1 euro same bottle 2 euro in Rome centre. Carrefour at end of lane turn left walk till you see macdonalds cross road to macdonalds then follow road down 1/4 mile and its on your left. If you want to take some wine home buy it here it was more expensive in duty free. This supermarket has got everything you might need snacks/toiletries. 3 If you want to see the Sistine chapel and Vatican museums get there as early as possible we got there for 9am and there was no que to get in. We had tried to get in at 1pm the day before and the que was over 3 hours long. Ps its red hot in there so take water and a hand held fan you will thank me believe me. No photos allowed in Sistine chapel (we managed a sly few) but its ok to photo everywhere else. 4 Martini bar/restaurant near Colloseum is a total rip off. beware the staff will temp you in and rip you off. We sat down and asked for 2 large beers what they bought out was 2 tankers holding about 1 1/2 litres of lager each this cost us 30 euros. When the bill came the staff hang round to intimidate you. so you have to pay. 5 Buy a ticket for the 110 open red bus. It,s a bus that you can hop on and off at your leisure and it stops at all the main attractions. It runs from 8.30 am to 8.30pm. Look it up on the web www.trambus 6 Its free to get into st peters square and the cathedral, again go early to avoid the ques. No shorts allowed and shoulders must be covered. it costs you 5 or 7 euros if you want to go up to the cupola (that the dome). 5 euros if you walk all the way 7 you can take the lift and walk the last 250 steps. 7 In a restaurant if you order for example a steak a steak is all you will get, you will get no veg or potatoes these must be ordered seperately. So check with your waiter exactly what you get for your money. 8 The lane leading up to the hotel on a night is pitch black so be very carefull as cars speed down this lane.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Antipolo City, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cHotel is great but staff service is hit-and-miss\u201d", "Author": "wannacdworld", "ReviewID": "UR114973926", "Content": "We had stayed for two nights in a suite which cannot be faulted, very spacious, nice beds / sofa beds, loads of closet space and two bathrooms.

It is also quite far from any store so do take that into consideration.

The hotel is exactly as the pictures show; clean and modern. The staff were all friendly and welcoming and there was plently of information about the busses and how to get to the city centre. Our room was large and comfortable with a wetroom and tea/coffee making facilities. Our first night wasn't great - I was woken in the middle of the night by the banging of doors, people talking in the corridoors and outside the hotel, and noise from above our room. The rooms are definately not soundproof and really lets the hotel down. Fortunately, the following 2 nights were peaceful (presumably from the departure of some of the noisier guests). The breakfast was better than most, with a variety of bread, cakes, cereals, bacon, eggs and fruits. Although there was a kettle in our room, the cream and milk was not replenished each day so we had to buy milk from the supermarket down the road. The buses are regular and run from up the road from the hotel to a station near the Vatican. We found this a nice way to travel but the bus back runs less regularly at night. We couldn't find a timetable anywhere, but it seemed like the 907 back to the hotel ran around every hour from about 8pm onwards. Tickets were bought from the newspaper shop about 10 minutes away from the hotel. We found this to be a generally good hotel, with clean and spacious rooms, good food and good staff.

Finding the hotel was easy, but we had looked it up on a map, and took our own satnav. About 45 minutes easy drive from Fiumicino and we were there. Ample free parking and on the level entry via the restaurant or the back door at floor 0. then up one floor in the lift to reception. We were made to feel welcome by the receptionist, who was at pains to answer any questions that we had about the location, where to go and how to get there. We had arrived a little early, but she contacted the housekeeping staff and allocated us a disabled room which we did not really need, but as nobody else needed it we took it because it was very close to the lift, had a \"wet room\" rather than a standard bathroom, and a view over the countryside. The room was east facing so caught the early morning sun, which explained why the windows were fitted with roller blinds, but unfortunately all three were broken. When we asked for them to be fixed, we were told that it was not possible because it was Saturday, but we could change rooms. Having looked at a few alternatives, we decided to stay put, but the hotel made it clear that we were welcome to change our minds. Apart from the lack of blinds, the room was comfortable, with flat screen satellite tv, a fridge, proper air conditioning (not the usual noisy hang on the wall units) and very fast but intermittent wifi. We had thought about using the hotel restaurant, but its menu was not terribly inspiring, and although modern and clean, there was little or no ambiance. That said, it was perfect for breakfast. A minor criticism was that the staff were not present all the time, and when things ran out they had to be requested. Apart from one member of staff, this did not go down too well. A downside of the \"all you can eat\" concept is that some people insist on taking far more than they can eat, even when they can see that there are people waiting behind them, and it is sad to see the high levels of waste that the hotel has to tolerate. The quality of the food at breakfast was excellent, and the staff continued to provide top ups on request for as long as there were guests in the room. Access to and from the hotel was easy, with people on reception duty at all times, and our late return from the city one hight did not present any problems. The local area does not have much to offer, apart from a busy McDonald's and some supermarkets to the left and a range of small restaurants to the right of the Via degli Scolopi. We were able to stock up with \"picnic food\" and cheap high quality wine for the following day from Carrefour, and there were several bars, Pasticceria(s) and take away food shops, but most were closed by 8pm.
