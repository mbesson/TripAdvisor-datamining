I'd researched the hundreds of hotel options in the historic section of Sultanahmet, Istanbul. There were no compelling options that weren't above my price range. After revising my search parameters to include non-smoking rooms the Cosmopolitan Park Hotel appeared as one of he few hotels that is entirely smoke free. That ended up my deciding factor and I couldn't be more happy with the decision. The Cosmopolitan Park Hotel will give you the taste of traditional Turkish accommodations. No the rooms aren't huge, they are adequate. But the beds are extremely comfortable and the AC cold when needed. No the bathroom doesn't have a jacuzzi tub, but they are big enough with hot water and strong water pressure. No there's no elevator/lift, but we could all use the exercise and if you want fancy, go to he Four Seasons. I can't say enough about the staff. Mr. Kamil was very prompt in responding to my every email and scheduling transportation for us. Mr. Fehme was there to carry bags up and down, had breakfast with hot tea and coffee for us each morning, all with a wonderful smile. Both offered trustworthy recommendations for site seeing and restaurants (the Meat House around the corner was our best meal of all).

The first thing I noticed was that there was no lift. Although someone from the hotel carried our luggage up the two flights of stairs on arrival, we had to do the reverse on our own at departure. For people traveling with more than the rollaboard bag I had, that would be a big inconvenience. The room was small but clean. In the bathroom, my friend and I discovered that the toilet seat was not securely attached to the toilet. We also found that one of the two shower doors was broken, so it would not stay on its track. I expected it to fall on me while I was taking a shower. The \"land side\" room had no view whatsoever. We overlooked a trash strewn roof and run down buildings. The breakfast was very, very limited. On the one morning I actually had the breakfast, my choices were limited to not much more than some olives, bread, watermelon, and a juice box.

This was our first tvisit to Istanbul and we were on a business trip. Cosmopolitan Park Hotel met our expectations and we definitely plan on returning to this hotel when we visit Istanbul next. Mr. Kamil is a delightful host! He is ever helpful and makes himself available at all times (for example, we had to catch an early morning flight to Ephesus which meant our leaving at 5.30am from the hotel and he was there to assist us). The staff, Mr. Kazim and Ms. Esvet, are nice and welcoming. They too go out of their way to be helpful and offer their services with a smile!

Location: It is just a block and a half from the Arasta Bazaar and very close to (less than 10 minutes walk) to the Aya Sofya, the Blue Mosque, the Hippodrome, the commuter train station, the tram station, eateries, travel agencies, etc.). Restaurant and terrace: The hotel has an enclosed restaurant on the fourth floor with stunning views of the Sea of Marmara. Breakfast is served there daily (8.00am to 10.30am) and one can enjoy the passing boats, ferries, and ships. Seagulls come closer and add to the scenery. The open terrace on the fifth floor offers an even better view of the surroundings and one could sit there for hours with a novel taking in the beautiful sights (particularly the Blue Mosque) all around. The restaurant has a bar, but we did not use the services. WiFi: The hotel has WiFi available at all levels. While the strength of the signal is variable, the availability of WiFi makes communication simpler and 24/7. Breakfast: Breakfast is included in the price and includes hard boiled eggs, fresh cut cucumbers and tomatoes, cold cuts, corn flakes, cheese, black olives, green olives, yogurt, fresh bread rolls, etc. Beverages include regular coffee, regular tea, juice (in boxes) and water (in boxes). Breakfast is sumptuous. but does not vary on a daily basis. Hot water: Hot water is available 24/7 and the temperature is comfortable. Heat: The radiant heat is controlled by a central thermostat and offered comfortable heat at night when the temperature dropped quite a bit. Security: The rooms (we stayed in two different rooms--one with a view of the Sea and another without) have good locking mechanisms. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood. We also felt very safe with our son staying by himself at different levels (lobby, restaurant, terrace, room, etc.). Rooms: Each room had its own unique decoration and character. The rooms have spacious attached baths. Linen was changed every day and this included towels. The rooms and baths were clean. The triple room was rather small and would serve well as a double, as storage space and space for empty luggage were limited. The rooms have a mini-refrigerator that came in handy to store beverages and food, a coffee maker (we had no need to use it), a mini-TV (mostly receives channels that are in Turkish), and a hair dryer (a definite plus). Shampoo, bath gel and soap are provided in the bath. In addition, Mr. Kamil is there to answer any questions about travel around Istanbul or Turkey, help finalize travel plans, select restaurants, assist with local transportation (for example, R/T to Ataturk International Airport), and above all is a good conversationalist!

On the less positive side, the room size was rather small, and the window sight was on the rear side, on very degraded buildings (the whole area is rather degraded, exception made for hotels, restaurants, bars and carpet shops). Although very clean, and with excellent hot water supply, the bath maintenance was questionable (broken tiles, leaking taps). The breakfast room had a breathtaking sight on the Bosphorus, but was rather cold, which is not very pleasant in winter time. The stairs were very narrow and sharp, so if you have a heavy luggage, you'll be in trouble (no elevator).

This neighbourhood is the hub of the food, music, arts and crafts scene. Through summer the place buzzes when people arrive from all over the world. There is so much is happening in the area. Well, one of the major airports is just thirty minutes away. While we were staying in Aug 2008, we enjoyed the modern amenities such as TV, split system cooling in each bedroom. The staff were very friendly and willing to answer any question. The service was excellent. Breakfast is self served with many choices and endless cups of coffee. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Many thanks to the management.

The hotel was comfortable and centrally located so that we could walk to see the sights, shop, have fun with the local people. The rooms are not big but they are clean, comfortable and beautifully decorated. One member of our group ordered a bedspread from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supplier and it was delivered the next day. I liked the fact that the Cosmopolitan has two computers set up so that you can send a quick note home and also research places in Turkey. Many evenings we would sit and just talk and laugh with Kamil. We also visited Kamil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother Dogan at the Terrace Guest House. The Terrace is another great place to stay; if you get a chance to stay there ask for the top floor. You will have to walk up in both hotels but hey exercise is good. I enjoyed the fact that Kamil was able to give us great directions so we could venture out by bus and ferry to see more of this beautiful city. As FrancieP wrote, this wonderful man planned our trip down the west coast of Turkey for us in 2006. Many times we called Kamil and he would bail us out of our situation. If you are a lady traveller or are in need of advise you are in good hands here. The hotel offers a very good Turkish style breakfast of eggs, tomato, cucumber, bread, yogurt, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee (Nescafe:-),and tea. Now that I am home I sometimes treat myself to this just to get me back to Turkey, even found some Nescafe to make it more authentic!", "Date": "September 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turkey", "Title": "\u201cCosmopolitan Park a Great Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Karuna8", "ReviewID": "UR19738045", "Content": "I loved the Cosmpolitan Park Hotel.
