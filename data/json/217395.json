This was the 3rd time I'd stayed at the Mayfair. The first 2 stays happened about 5 years ago (July 2007) and I liked it enough to try it a 3rd time, even after reading a lot of bad reviews on the decline of the hotel. Let me just say that the hotel was in need of updating back in 2007, however, at the time, I found it to be fairly clean and enjoyable nonetheless and the prices were fair, given the wear. In my mind, the two main things this hotel has going for it is 1) location in beautiful Coconut Grove and next to CocoWalk. 2) private balconies with nice hot tub. Any other hotel with a in-room jacuzzi would cost considerably more and hotels in South Beach are also far more expensive. HOWEVER, Mayfair--you seriously need to update this hotel!! It doesn't even need a major overhaul--a fresh coat of paint, new accent pillows, bedspreads, and furniture cushions would do wonders AND your housekeeping staff need to take some time to do DEEP cleaning. Corners, highs and lows, and some freshening to reduce the high Florida humidity musty smell. The rooms are spacious, I've never had a problem with the cleanliness of the hot tub except to say that they charge for filling (that's fine--I can live with that) but if that's the case and we're staying 2 or more days, please ask if we want it re-filled the next day when it's cleaned!! I also love the bath products and the nice TV's but my main issues were the horrible musty smell, overall dirtiness in the \"not so obvious\" spots, and the general wear and tear of the room, including \"rain\" shower head which was so old and clogged that only half the holes were clear to spray. As much as I really was rooting for this hotel due in large part to the unique rooms and gorgeous atrium, I was disappointed and won't be back unless I hear they've updated. If they do that, I'd be back for sure. I did report the smell to the front desk and they were very attentive and sent housekeeping/maintenance to try to fix it but all they did was re-clean the floor. This did very little but I appreciated the effort.

The entire hotel feels dated and the architecture and design is just strange. I couldn't tell if it was going for a caribbean feel, an Incan fortress, or a Turkish prison. Let's start with the rooms: The rooms, while enormous suites, are designed with angles that make the rooms feel totally disconnected. The biggest problem for me was that the rooms were very long and narrow and at the end of the room was a balcony that was covered in lattice and vegetation. This results in the rooms having absolutely no direct sunlight and zero view. Who wants to look out of a long, narrow space into a view that look like bars of a prison. Just awful. Secondly, while the balconies are big with a sofa and a private Japanese soaking tub, the tub looked like it was last used in the 1960s, and who wants to sit on a balcony and look out at nothing? To be fair, the rooms themselves did have a lot of great amenities such as a flat screen in the bathroom, a fully stocked bar, and tons of closet and drawer space for clothes. The Property Grounds: The hotel itself is built with a big open air courtyard, but because of the odd design there are not many places to sit and enjoy it. The glass elevators are definitely in need of repair and redesign as is the whole tired property itself. The restaurant was just okay. The breakfast was not bad, but in order to get back to the rooms from the tiny gym you had to walk through the restaurant, so as you are dining you get to enjoy a parade of sweaty guests in their work out gear. Not pleasant and again speaks to the odd design of the place. The rooftop pool space is amazing. Without question, the best aspect of this hotel, but not nearly enough for me to recommend that anyone stay here. With cabanas, a bar, a good sized pool, this space is really great. Unfortunately, I was here on business and it rained every day so I could only enjoy it for a few hours the day I left. The spa is also a plus. I got a fantastic massage and the relaxation area and changing rooms are very nice. Service: Service was sort of a mixed bag as well. Not many smiles and a fair amount of attitude among on the front desk staff and some of the valets. That being said, the waiters were very nice, but in general, not the level of service you'd expect for a hotel at this price point. Location: The location was good for Coconut Grove, if you want to be across the street from Coco Walk. However, It was quite loud both at night and in the early morning with trucks. Oh, one last thing. The Wireless connection was terrible. So slow I could barely use it and it often didn't work at all. The excuse: it was raining. Really?! All in all, I'd say don't waste your money here and stay at a different hotel in the area.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice!\u201d", "Author": "infl", "ReviewID": "UR124042103", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here in January 2012.

We cannot thank them enough and we would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone for future weddings or special events", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tampa, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood deal, comfy & huge rooms!\u201d", "Author": "Rachel608", "ReviewID": "UR122611435", "Content": "First impression when walking into this hotel: \"What is the funky theme in this place??\" For real, you will be asking the same question. I still did not figure it out, possibly a Frank Lloyd Wright type of thing(Straight edges, darker wood fixtures etc. Other People said Raiders of the Lost Ark, lol. First impression when walking into our hotel room: OMG this room is HUGE. Living room with wicker furniture, flat screen tv and 4 person dining table. Then I walk into the bedroom, it is like an L shaped room with a hot tub, bathroom, and bedroom, smaller closet with fridge, and a dresser. Both the Bedroom and Bathroom had flatscreen televisions. Everything was very white in the room. This hotel is a little bit dated, but it's not bad at all. You can tell by the type of tile used. The fixtures, and the outside hallways, and the wood fixture on the wall. They make it comfy for you though by supplying bathrobes and slippers bc it's all tile. This place is also pet friendly and you pay a $50 fee. That includes a dog bed, food and water dish, and dog biscuits. Another nice touch. Service was great for the front desk, the concierge, and valet parking. They answered our questions correctly, took care of making sure our tv worked, we had extra towels, and they brought our luggage downstairs and brought our car to us each time. How sweet, treated like kings and queens. This hotel is in walking distance of some side walk cafes and boutiques and a small mall with a few stores, most importantly starbucks. It is a nice walk when you have a dog bc they have a walking trail by water and a nice park. If you want to go to South Beach, or chill on the beach by Key Biscayne it's like 15-25 minutes so make sure you have a car or you will not have much to do. We chilled at their roof top pool pretty cool, nice temperature and comfy chairs, pool bar, but it just closed too early, at dusk. The front desk suggested Jaguar restaurant to us as a place to go for dinner. We did that, and it was very good, nice modern and pet friendly. Check this place out for a stop going to the keys, or a little weekend getaway. It will be relaxing and nice. Just keep in mind just bc it is dated doesn't mean it's not great. It was nice, clean, and most people there were efficient, respectful, and helpful. The reason I placed this hotel as average instead of very good is bc the cleaning people had thrown out one of my Xmas gift bags. It had some small xmas presents in there, but not too valuable so I did not want to make a huge deal of it, but watch your stuff. The second reason is bc I was using my $20 credit for the hotel restaurant. This was included in my groupon getaways package - suite, free valet parking and $20 credit for the hotel restaurant. One of the managers failed to read my certificate and said that it was expired. After that, he retracted it, but did not apologize.

Having visited Coconut Grove a few years before, this seemed a well located spot to further explore the beaches and amentities of this popular South Florida destination. We were very disappointed in the service that The Mayfair provided and the seemingly indifference of the management team to see to the needs of all their guests. In contrast the attitudes and the responsiveness of staff working the 'shop floor' from bar staff, cleaning staff, pool attendants and concierges were exemplary. They could not be more helpful. The major problem with this property is its uncomfortable split between being a boutique hotel and/or events and conference centre. The two do not mix well and often the needs of the regular paying guests are overlooked or ignored in the rush to secure the corporate buck. There is a noise factor from the events in the internal courtyard and conference rooms and the rooftop pool and patio is frequently made unavailable due to some corporate sponsored event. Management did not make any concession or apology to the disturbed or displaced guests who booked their stay at the hotel hoping for a peaceful and intimate getaway. The hotel is also in need of a serious makeover as parts are looking quite shabby. We would not recommend this property for anyone seeking an enjoyable stay in this area. There are at least two properties close by which would offer a much better service and in more comfortable surroundings. The water-cooler talk is that the Mayfair is about to undergo a change of ownership . This might explain some of the inconsistencies in service found there. If this the case I would hope the new managers will restore a quality of stay for all levels of guest on the property. Repeat business is the key to staying successful in this industry.

After emailing the hotel twice and not receiving replies, my husband phoned them about our room preferences. At check-in, they informed us that we could not have a fridge, or ensure us a quiet room. Not a good start. Eventually, the concierge, Carmen, found our emails and assigned us a room with a fridge. This is a 1930's era hotel, with interesting architecture and a great location. The rooms are large and the bathroom is very large and has tub and shower. However, this is not a 4* room. It needs to be updated (floors, doors, furniture) before it could be classified as 4*. The house keeping team kept it clean and it was always ready upon our arrival. There are three major issues at this hotel. The first is the extremely poor and unprofessional attitude of the management, who were never in evidence, unless they were arranging an event. The second issue the pool. There were multiple events every day of our stay at this property and many of them took place at the pool. Therefore the management closed the pool for 5 of the 7 days we were there. We were never told of these pool closings ahead of time,(as extremely poor communication is the rule here). We would arrive at the pool and a sign would be posted saying-\"Event today. Pool closed. Thank-you for your patience.\" On the last two days of our holiday, the sign said \"Pool closed for repair November 21 & 22 for repairs. By this point, we had had enough. We contacted the concierge, Ignacio,(who was professional and helpful) and asked him to arrange for us to use another pool. This took about an hour and required a letter from the manager, Gloria, which allowed us to use the pool at the Sonesta,(a superb hotel). Never have I worked so hard on a holiday, just to go swimming. On the two days when their pool was open to guests, we endured loud voices of the people planning their events for the next day. After that, there was a 2 hour photo shoots in the pool. On our last morning, we listened to a worker repairing the bar with an electric sander. The pool attendant had not been informed of this work, either and the bar staff arrived to an empty bar. The third issue here is noise. Some of the events here took place in the inner inside courtyard below the rooms. Many were loud and one (a dog fashion show-only in Miami), lasted until midnight. This is a very noisy hotel. There is also street noise from the clubs on the streets below. The one good thing here is the young staff who work so hard to please guests. We appreciate and want to compliment Ignacio, the concierge, Aaron, the superb bar-tender at the pool,(who is from New Orleans and made us beignets at home adnd delivered them to us,Raul, the professional and polite pool attendant, Nicole, another delightful pool bartender and Alexa, who to helped us at the when we mentioned the noise. These people work very hard we appreciated them. As for Juan, the pool supervisor, who ignored me and fobbed me off to a young server, when I was concerned about the noise,he was rude, ambivalent,and should not work with people.

All the hotel employees were extremely nice and polite. The hotel was selected via Priceline.com, so the rates were amazing. The cons: 1) Wifi access was only possible in one small area of the lobby. Anywhere else, including rooms, it did not work. Nothing to do with signal strength, but some weird configuration on the routers would not the devices acquire IP addresses. 2) The room was clean, but not pristine. The room smelled like mold mixed with some kind of benzene based cleaner. It was worse when the A/C was off. 3) The disappearing towels: on one day we did a round-trip to Disney's Epcot and back (4h each way!). Arriving around 11:30PM, we found out that we had only ONE bath towel for us two!! As a result I had to use my wife's wet towel to dry myself... The next day, we found two bath towels, but now, no hand towels... 4) No ice machines, so you cannot bring your own beverage without having to call room service for ice. 5) The cherry on top: a false fire alarm woke us up around midnight Oct 19th. After 16h of flight, we were exhausted, and had to wake up in the middle of the night to abandon our room.

The second experience was the elevator - dated, old, smelled and I felt I was going to get stuck in it. Then the corridor to the room, with wooden inlays on the walls reminded me of a swiss chalet and the open-court layout with stone carvings reminded me of a Maya-inspired beach hotel in Cancun. Then the room was minimalist again, huge, seemed plain and the sheets, towels and cushions on the living room were torn, old and looked dirty. Another oddity was that the coffee maker and dryer were in the bathroom... but there was absolutely no power outlet in the whole bathroom, except behind the TV which has hanging high on the wall so it wouldn't work anyways (I even looked behind the toilet for an outlet). On my last morning I saw what I thought was a mosquito on a pillow but it was a tick, so I killed it, packed and left. Another thing is that the housekeeping staff had no idea about check-outs, they woke me up every single day to ask if I was leaving that day!

We booked our room through Hotwire to get the best value. After traveling for days, the bed/shower was a welcome sight. We spent most of our time in the room and here's what we thought: * Room: Great value as far as space is concerned. The rooms are all technically suites. Our room included a bathroom (with soaking tub/shower combo), King-size bed, sitting area, outdoor lanai with Japanese soaking tub (we didn't use because it didn't look all that clean and cost $30 to have filled with water). * Bed: The hotel decorated the room with a ton of decorative pillows (which you immediately toss off the bed because they never get washed), but there were only two pillows! There was also one hidden in the closet. They were also standard size pillows --- not King-size. Seemed odd to me that they would skimp on their guests' comfort this way. There should have been six if using standard-size or four if using King-size. * Service: An ice bucket was provided in our room, leading us to believe an ice machine was around the corner. We walked the entire perimeter of our floor, not finding an ice machine anywhere (by the way, the architecture of the hotel is pretty neat ... Asian-inspired, most of the hotel is open to the outdoors). We called the front desk to ask where the machines are located. They informed us that there are no machines, but they would bring some up to our room (kinda defeats the purpose of the ice bucket!). After 45 minutes of waiting for our ice, we cancelled our order. No apologies were given by the staff --- pretty unacceptable. * Bathroom: While large, it didn't seem luxurious. It was like any other hotel bathroom. Towels were discolored and there weren't a lot of them. In fact, I think there were only two large towels per adult. We called housekeeping for more towels ... Luckily, they were more responsive than the front desk and we received them within 15 minutes.

The rooftop pool was awesome(Jorge just might have been the nicest person we met), our spa treatments were great (my girlfriend loved Anna and I thought Eva was probably the best massage I ever had). We loved the neighborhood with all the great bars and shops. This is not your typical hotel, and thats what we liked about it.

This hotel at first is VERY pleasing to the eye. Beautifully decorated, lovely water sounds trickling througout. Every room is a bit different but smartly furnished. Nicely re-done bathrooms with large screen TV's in both the \"main\" room and bath. Very plush comfy beds. Then the idea of a balcony and soaking tub - wonderful. Then the reality sets in once you start unpacking your bags. Your feet turn DARK BLACK from the flithy floors. You open the door to the balcony and a rat trap is sitting right there for you to gaze adoringly at. The soaking tub was the most foul disgusting thing I had ever seen. Never in a million years would I have paid the $30 extra to fill it to sit in that filth. The bathroom had a nice little counter with a coffee pot and condiments for coffee - - but there was no outlet to plug it into. Any events they have in the open air spaces send loud sounds right into your room - forget a nap and if you have kids NEVER stay here. The roof top pool, again great in theory, has some cool elements, but the floors are filthy, no one really picks up or cleans up towels. You aren't sure if the lounge chairs that have a towel on them for the past 4 hours are actually being saved by someone or if the staff is just too lazy to pick them up. We had no problem with getting the room we reserved, though many people at the wedding did. The location, however, is awesome. The owners of Mayfair need to get this straight. This could be an AWESOME hotel. It has all of the right elements going. Location, space, relaxing but cool vibe, but they have LONG way to go. The clientele that they are going after expects MUCH MORE than this. I don't want to feel gross and disgusting walking barefoot. I don't want to see dirt and hair in every corner of the hotel. CLEAN UP. For the kind of hotel this SHOULD be, I should be able to lick the floor. I mean seriously. It should be gleaming, but foul and disgusting.

It took harrasing phone calls and e-mails to get a response for very important questions. When it came time to pay my final bill for the event, they kept charging me more than they were supposed to. Thank God, I noticed their mistakes! We had 16 room blocked for the wedding and the day of the wedding everyone was waiting around for their rooms. They were not getting the type of rooms they had requested months in advance. My father was basically told to \"figure it out\" when he was being given a king size bed for a family of four (adults). My brother-in-law was told he had to pay now an additional $30 to get a double bed room even though that is what he had reserved. On the day of my wedding when I was supposed to be enjoying my day and getting ready, those were the issues I had to deal with. The final straw was after the wedding when I receive a notification from my bank that the Mayfair Hotel had charged me almost $6,000 more than they were supposed to! My final bill for my event was supposed to be only $59.00 and they charged me close to $6,000! I will never go back to this hotel in my life.

I decided to go ahead and give it a try since we are from Florida, and opted to stay in the state for our honeymoon to eliminate stress after our big day. I was a little nervous since I had some odd belief that this was a small, boutique hotel, and Miami can be hit or miss on the quality of the area... however, as we drove into the valet area- with all of wedding flowers and luggage in tow- my eyebrows raised over the ornate woodwork and beauty that the lobby presented. We were greeted warmly by both the valet and front desk staff, who congratulated us on our honeymoon. As we went up the elevator- overlooking the open atrium area (definitely NOT small by any means), we walked out and down the hallway. Every single door was made of detailed, carved wood, and each had a name- such as the Magnolia Suite, or something of the sort. As we rounded the corner, we approached a double-door entrance, it dawned on me this was our room. I felt like I was in \"The Hangover\" as we walked in to see marble floors, a column in the middle of the room, a huge garden tub/spa, separate living room/dining room, flat screen tvs in each room, including the bathroom, etc. As if the room wasn't enough, our bellhop was extremely resourceful and insightful, suggested a couple of local restaurants to visit, and places of interest. When we called for ice, it arrived in less than a minute, and was followed up by a call from the front desk to make sure we received it. The hotel is situated next to Coconut Grove's Cocowalk shopping/restaurant plaza- which has every large chain retailer/restaurant you can desire. As well as smaller, unique restaurants- such as the Jaguar- which offers delicious ceviche spoon samplers and white sangria, while sitting outside people watching. We also had breakfast at the hotel's attached restaurant, which had a wide variety of fruit, pastries, juices, etc. In the afternoon, we sampled their pizza- which was truly delicious! We also had booked a spa package, including a couples massage. The facilities were gorgeous, relaxing, and the staff absolutely amazing.

The lobby was decorated in a tropical and flowery fashion. There was parking, but it cost $26 per night (We parked at the Coco Walk across the street for $14). It looked very inviting and gave a nice impression. The first flaw I encountered was that the hotel was strangely shaped. I could never really figure how to get around the hotel- I kept walking in circles (and running into a broken elevator) trying to get to my room. The only way to get to the gym is to walk through the restaurant, which is fancy- unpleasant to walk through in your exercise clothing. The first time I saw the room, my daughter said, \"They must have spent so much money decorating the lobby that they must have gotten lazy on the room.\" What she said is completely true. The room was nothing special. First of all, I was staying with my family, so I needed at least two beds but there was only one, which was described by the receptionist as a king size-however, I am quite sure it was a queen. I then ordered a roll-away (for $20) for my son, and my daughter slept on the floor.

This is advertised as a 4-star property, and despite the quirky features throughout, does fit the bill. The hotel is entered off the valet driveway and there are no dedicated sidewalks, which means pedestrians and cars get to fight it out. The main entrance has only a single-width door, which is problematic any time one person wants to enter when another wants to leave (i.e., most of the time). The front desk area is surprisingly small, and the lobby consists of a bench and small elevator bank. Turns out there is an attractive inner courtyard, but getting to said courtyard is not at all easy. The \"suite\" I stayed in was the same size as an comparable hotel room found in any other 4-star hotel in the U.S., so don't let the name fool you. The tabletops were dusty, as was the floor, so I get the impression that maid service doesn't have an eye for detail. The bathroom was very attractive, but I was not enamored with the half-open tub design. There was a patio with a hot tub, but I did not use either because I spent most of my time outside of the hotel. Despite the landscaping, the patios front right onto the street. The Mayfair parking garage charges an outrageous $24 for overnight parking. I parked in the MPA structure a block away and paid $5. The Coconut Grove business district is right across the street, so there are several attractive sidewalk restaurants to choose from for dinner. The area's nightlife, however, leaves something to be desired. I didn't find street noise to be especially problematic most of the time, but then again my room faced to the north, away from the center of the action. However, I was mildly annoyed by the wedding reception that occurred in the courtyard, as there was no way to block out the noise of the festivities from my room. Design fail! There is a rooftop pool, but it closes at sunset. Major bummer. The rooftop bar has potential, but I took a look both nights of my stay and it was dead. Who wants to drink alone? Overall, this hotel isn't worth it unless you get a super deal from one of those bidding sites or really want to be in Coconut Grove.

In terms of cleanliness, the rooms were fine- cleaned thoroughly every day. What was odd was that they would not clean the hot tub. So every day I had to clean it before we used it!! Sadly, what did spoil the stay significantly was the noise levels. We did have ear plugs, but the noise coming from the leisure complex opposite and the roof on occasions, was completely unacceptable. This happened Thursday to Sunday and did not stop until 0300. One evening, we were kept awake by motorbikes as well. i appreciate that this is to a degree beyond the control of the hotel, but it is such a shame. I did use the rooftop pool, which was totally decadent, and the service there was excellent.

We love South Beach, but we wanted to visit another area of Miami to see what it had to offer. We heard the Grove was a more chill and relaxing spot and based upon the reviews below, we booked at the Mayfair Resort and Spa. We knew we would miss having the beach nearby, but figured that the rooftop pool would do for our short 48 hour trip. Check-in went smoothly. The property is beautiful and is close to everything that the Grove has to offer. Unfortunately, those are the only positive things I can say about the hotel. In fact, our hotel stay was such a disaster, that we cut our trip short and caught an earlier flight back to New Jersey. Our first day, the TV did not work and we called the front desk who sent an Engineer who never showed up. My husband figured out the problem and was able to fix it. The next day (our first full day) our room was not cleaned until we called the front desk and requested for it to be cleaned. Then, once it was cleaned, they took all of our towels and did not replace them with new ones. Ok, we are easy going folks. No sweat. We just called for more. This is the big problem. When other reviewers noted the 1 AM parties on the rooftop keeping them awake, I think they were just being polite. The Mayfair hosts hip-hop parties for students at a nearby university. According to one of the students, these parties are OFTEN held at the Mayfair. There was a party the night after we arrived, one the following day and one that night (or, maybe it was a continuance of the party that day). The music is loud, ghetto and extraordinarily offensive. The crowd also made me very uncomfortable and before, during and after the parties, they filled up the lounge and the lobby of the hotel. I felt very unsafe. And, this is not a racist comment because I am African-American. There was a wedding going on at the same time as the party on the first night and I overheard four wedding guests complaining about the crowd. After the first night, I thought the party was an anomaly and my husband I went upstairs in our bathing suits the very next morning, with books in tow, looking forward to a drink in the Florida sun. When we got upstairs, the same music was playing and was so offensive that several couples who were also guests of the hotel quickly left. One couple was on the elevator considering checking-out because his fianc\u00c3\u00a9 did not feel comfortable at the hotel. We were told we would have to pay a cover charge to stay by the pool. We went downstairs to complain that the rooftop had not been accessible to us the prior day and was, basically, not accessible at that time. The hotel staff was extremely rude and basically had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So what?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd attitude. The manager, Nicole, was just as bad. She did, however, give us the option of joining the party. Yes, Nicole, I want to go to the roof, listen to offensive music and fear for my life because of the crowd you have allowed to take over your hotel. Also, all of the seats and lounge chairs were roped off for use by the party goers. So, there was no place to sit. Then to boot, Nicole quickly informed my husband and I that the Cabana we had inquired about (solely because all the lounge chairs were roped off) was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153$300 anyway\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcthey were not free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in a manner suggesting that $300 was likely far above our means. So, we should not be bothered by the fact they were all reserved for use by non-hotel guests. Look, talking about money is super pass\u00c3\u00a9, but my husband and I do very well for ourselves. I can only assume she thought the $300 was prohibitive because we are a minority couple. Regardless, they never apologized and did not offer up anything to make-up for our gross inconvenience other than the staff rolling their eyes, sucking their teeth and their generally ghetto attitude toward the situation. Regardless, they told us we could access the pool at 3 PM. When we returned to the hotel after 3 PM, the lobby was flooded with men with mouths full of gold teeth, the elevator smelled like vomit, the party was still going on (and would continue into the night) and the hotel staff\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ghetto attitudes were still going as strong as the ghetto party upstairs. Finally, we just paid for a Jacuzzi set up in our room. There is a $30 set-up fee. The $30 set-up includes 2 towels, a bottle of the already-free shower shell and someone coming to turn on the Jacuzzi. The Jacuzzi itself was a breeding ground for fungus (we assumed, incorrectly, that cleaning it was part of the set-up). So, we ended up not using it. On top of all this, there was no Wi Fi access and we saw a very large roach in our hotel room. I have been practicing law for over 10 years, but even if I had not, any layperson can tell you that what the Mayfair is doing is tantamount to fraud. They list amenities on their site. They represent that those amenities will be part of your stay if you book. You book a room based upon their representations. However, when you get there, you learn that the representations are blantantly false. I do not call risking your life to stand by pool (since there are no chairs) as making something accessible. Every hotel has its off weekends. I love the Mondrian and the Tides. Even so, I have had off stays at both, but I never complain because the staff bends over backwards to accommodate you and make up for it, without you having to ask. That attitude is what lets me know I am dealing with a good hotel that is merely having an off weekend and not a bad hotel. The attitude of the staff at the Mayfair demonstrates that it is just a bad hotel. You want to leave feeling like your hard earned cash went to good use. Even though we got the Mayfair at a really cheap price, I still felt like we were robbed of our money. We jumped on an early flight and headed home wishing we had just gone to our normal hotel in South Beach. Maybe we will return to the Grove, but not to the Mayfair.", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "florida", "Title": "\u201cThey ruined my wedding anniversary\u201d", "Author": "aneliram", "ReviewID": "UR70302994", "Content": "I was looking for a romantic place for my wedding anniversary, for the 1st time we can celebrate, we have 2 small kids and is hard to find who takes care of them, but finally this year, we had who can take care of them for the weekend.

The hotel appearance was exactly as we remembered. Very tropical and romantic. The staff we encountered were helpful, friendly and English speaking. Room had plenty of storage, microwave, safe, big-flat screen tv, dvd player. Excellent working air conditioner and tiled floors - no carpet. Might be considered a little sterile to look at, but we like this. This is an open air hotel, thus might explain some of the \"smells\" that some folks have complained of. Keep an open mind that Miami is a tropical location and this is an open air hotel. The hotel could stand to update the hot-tubs or lose them. Accept them for what they are - aged. Pool was on the smaller side, but great. It is rooftop and it is heated, even in the summer. So swim early am or late pm. Cabanas and fireplace are great to look at. Coconut Grove is easy breezy during the day, but comes to life at night. This includes the Mayfair. You will hear music and bustling in the streets starting around 6pm til ?.

We had a great time with each of them there. We were never concerned with safety. Activities for children are minimum at the hotel, but there are activities, including multiple parks nearby.

First the good stuff: The Mayfair is a beautiful and architecturally interesting hotel. It is built around a center courtyard which is open to all floors and to the sky although you never actually have to go out from under cover to get anywhere in the hotel. The check in/ check out process was smooth and easy. We didn't use the concierge service so can't comment on that. We also didn't eat any meals there except at the wedding reception. The location is nice if you want to be in Coconut Grove. But basically the area around the hotel consists of shopping at chain stores (e.g. The Gap), a few local apparel stores, but with a smattering of very good local restaurants. You are one block from multiple Biscayne Bay marinas (but no beach) and a short drive to Vizcaya. But that is it. If you want serious walking you may want to stay on Miami Beach. One of the very basic things that a traveler expects from any hotel is a quiet peaceful room where one can get a decent night of sleep. That thought brings me to the bad stuff: This hotel is neither peaceful nor quiet. First, there is the problem of the beautiful central atrium that I mentioned before. The noise from the atrium basically bounces around, goes down the hallways, through the room door, and into your ears. Why? Because the architecture of the entire hotel is solid surfaces and there is nothing to dampen the noise. We were down the hall from the elevators and could still hear the bell everytime the elevator stopped at our floor. In fact, there is no sound absorbing material anywhere in this hotel which brings me to... Second, the hallway floors are tile. So everytime someone rolls their luggage down the hall (which happened at 1 am our first night), the luggage bounces over the joints in the tile and makes a tremendous racket. Not to mention the housekeeping carts etc during the day. Third, our room faced the Cocowalk (an open air mall) across the street. The balconies are essentially concrete rectangles (including the ceiling) so that noise was funneled right into... you guessed it... our room. That wouldn't be so bad except that there are apparently some open air clubs or restaurants that play loud music until 1 am. Did I mention the 2 am police siren convention on the street? Did I mention that this is a noisy hotel? Did you read some of the previous reviews for this hotel where the guests mentioned that the hotel offered them earplugs? In summary, this is a cool trendy hotel in a nice neighborhood and I would stay there again if they would solve the noise issue.

And although the property is very nice, the hotel overall missed the mark on many things: the room (a \"suite\") was large but unappealing. The furniture (wicker) was old and a bit beaten. The room was was quite bare with wooden boxes on the wall as \"art\". Overall the appearance seemed unfinished. The walls were an eggshell color throughout and although I understand the minimalism of Miami, for the 4-star rating I expected a little more effort put into making the room appealing and comfortable. The bed had no bedspread or decor (except for the oversized headboard) but was comfortable. The floors were also dirty, and the sheets were not changed during our 3-night stay. In addition, the housekeeping staff neglected to replace face towels in the bathroom (which was the nicest part of the room). However, even in the bathroom, there was no place to put your towel near the shower (the only hooks were across the room). The room had a wet bar, but there were no glasses, nor a refrigerator to put stuff in. Instead there was a mini-fridge stocked with high-priced items (this was expected). Unfortunately, the mini-fridge was in the closet along with a microwave (useless since there is no where to store cold foods) and a safe. The result was that half of the closet space was taken up by the fridge, worthless microwave, and safe. Upon arrival a light bulb was out (no biggie), except that a staff member came, took the blown-out bulb, said he would return and never did. Beware of the Finch Suite, room 357 (it is booked as one of their Venetian suites). It is directly across the street from Cocowalk and the music and street noise is quite loud in the room until around 3:00 AM. The staff gave us ear plugs. Also, due to the awkward shape of the room (bed was in a triangular area of the room, with the tv on the acute angle) it was uncomfortable t view the TV from either the bed or the small wicker couch because in both cases you had to view the TV from an angle. In addition, the TV cables were visible and made it impossible to close the curtains behind the TV. The in-suite jacuzzi was in another corner of the room with cheap blinds that allowed way too much light in, so be sure to bring eye shades if you want to sleep past sunrise. There was a cheap sony clock radio on an end table, some stationary in a drawer, but no pen. The valet parking is good, except for one night I had to wait over 25 minutes for my car. The reason given was that there was an \"event\" going on (there were no other people waiting for a car so I assume they had cars to park, not retrieve). We enjoyed the buffet breakfast. Unfortunately all the hot food at the buffet (potatoes, bacon, sausage) was cold. The to-oder omlettes were great, and I suspect that if they kept a closer eye on the buffet, it would be also. Just another case of missing the mark. In addition, gratuity is included in everthing, including bars and the buffet (18%). I typically tip 20%, but I don't like having it automatically added to the bill, especially since there were only two of us, and especially at a buffet, and there is no incentive for good service (although the service itself was fine). On the plus side, the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. The grounds were well kept and the property is beautiful. The rooftop pool and bar are quite nice, and the location is great. Overall I would say the Venetian suite we stayed in is not worth more than the $158/night that we paid.

Inside the rooms surround two Spanish tiled courtyards filled with plants and fountains. The rooms are all called 'suites' and are a decent size. The all seem to have these large terraces with Japanese hot-tubs on them - which they tell you they will get up and running for $30. I've never taken them up on the offer so I can't comment! Quite odd though, as you can see into the windows of the offices across the street. The terraces are screened with bamboo so I don't think they can see in :) There's a pool up on the roof which is a little intimidating with it's mix of the beautiful people hanging out there drinking mojitos. I think the best thing about the hotel is that it's in a really nice little neighbourhood, so you can easily walk out and get a coffee, a meal, watch a film, without having to get a taxi anywhere.

The decor is very modern and tranquil, and I have only good things to say about it. The bathroom also won points for me, because it was HUGE and had a million mirrors... oh, and a flat screen TV. This way I could look at myself while watching a movie - all at the same time. 2) As you may have read in other reviews, each room has a balcony with a hot tub. It would be necessary for me to add that these hot tubs are very outdated and gross, and are not free to use. You are charged $30 for each set-up (for every individual use, lasting 6hrs)... a set-up that you have to call the front desk for, and takes one full hour to prepare. Maybe it's just me, but doesn't that ruin the mood a bit? By the time all that happens, I'm ready for a nap or some pizza. Not worth it. 3) The location is wonderful, and ideal for those wanting to explore Coconut Grove by foot. It's adjacent to what is deemed Restaurant Row, where many charming sidewalk cafes and clothing shops are located. There is also a Starbucks, AMC theater, Chili's and Hooters next door. No need to even use a cab when staying here, because there is so much to do. If you do decide to hop in a cab and make your way to South Beach, note that it's going to cost you $40 to get there ($80 round trip). Not cheap. 4) The noise is an issue with this hotel. Every maid cart and drunken 21 year old that rumbled by the door was heard very distinctly, and successfully interfered in sleepy time. Just be prepared for that.. not ideal for light sleepers. 5) The pool was a bit shady. All the lounge chairs and towels were used up by a bunch of college kids who were friends with the waitress and bartender. They were not guests at the hotel, and it was very annoying and unprofessional. It is a rooftop pool that is fairly nice, however it is very small - there is no room for this kind of child's play. Not cool. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to others visiting Coconut Grove because of the decor and location alone.

The huge TV is great and the balcony with your own hot tub is great apart from you pay an additional $30 to have this filled. Half way through our stay it was emptied and not refilled. We were not left any instructions how to operate this. The linens on the bed are lovely and true quality. The hotel did not replenish the shower gel and I had to ask twice for this. The lighting controls in the room are extremely poor, you can not control most of the lights from a switch. I was on the 5th floor and Wi-Fi was not accessible from the room, you had to either stand outside the room or go into the lobby but they had connection problems and the service was almost nonexistent. I did inform the staff but nothing was done. The roof top bar is very nice however it has strange hours. One night it will close at 3am and then the next by 8pm it closes.

We got a great deal on this hotel and it had pretty good reviews on here. So here is my list of the best and the worst of the hotel. The Good - Location is cool. Restaurants and Shops within walking distance. The inprov comedy club is right around the corner. cheescake factory, chilis, hooters, johnny rockets, fat tuesdays, bice bistro and plenty of smaller restaurants within short walking distance. The hotel is about 10 minutes from downtown and it is easy to get to highways if you are driving. - Valet service was quick. anybody that has had bad valet service knows this is a true plus. we never waited longer than a few minutes for our car - Hotel amenities (spa and cabana bar). We utilized the spa that was int he hotel. It was great and very nice. Pricey but still worth it. The roof top cabana bar was jumpin on saturday night. It was like a nightclub for real! The music was good and well attended. We wound up going somewhere that was real wack in Northern Miami..when we could have just taken the elevator up to a nice party. - Guest services was prety quick in responding to our request. A couple of times we couldn't get anybody on the phone. I give them a B on this. - Price of the room was pretty reasonable. The room we had was pretty large with a jacuzzi in it. (Website said terrace, butt we didn;t have a terrace at all) - Very nice staff - Very spacious bathroom in our room. - Flat screen in the bathroom. The Not So Good: - No wireless internet or internet in our room!!!!! They had wireless on the first two floors and then the signal dies on the third floor. This is the reason why I wouldn't stay again. I have to have my internet when i'm out of town! - Concierge service was useless. I'm used to going to a hotel where the concierge is very knowledgeable of the area. Maybe the guy was new...i'll give him a benefit of a doubt. - The Bed Sheets/Towels were pretty dingy. The matress had a lot to be desired. The comforter on the matress seemed to always come from user the sheets :( I guess it was how the bed was made up. We saw spots on our sheets the first night. Unfortunately we didn't go to bed until 5am LOL...so we had to call up new sheets and remake the bed ourself. - The room had a distinct odor. It was kind of a closed off smell. The hotel has a open atrium area, so the hotel was very humid, including the inside the room. So i'm guesing that was the reason for the smell. - The rooms are not sound proof at all...you can hear everything in the hallway. Plus if you are light sleeper, weekend nights might be difficult for you if you go to bed early. Street noise and people socializing doesn't bother me at all. Now hallway noise is bothersome cause it sounded like they were knocking on our door LOL. I give the hotel a C-.

The room was HUGE - 1 large sitting room, 2 full bathrooms and separate HUGE jacuzzi inside just off the Master Bedroom. Everything was clean and nicely appointed. I would suggest that the hotel think about updating some of the furniture (especially in the highend, larger suites). Also, it would be a nice touch to have fresh flowers in the room, especially for a 4 star. We had both our wedding ceremony and reception in the hotel. I HIGHLY recommend this hotel for such an occasion, as it is large enough, well appointed and fairly reasonable for what you get. Ulla is exceptional in her position as Director of Catering. She went out of her way to add a few special touches to our wedding. She even sent complimentary room service to our room after the wedding because she knew we didn't eat very much throughout the night. The only problem the WHOLE evening, was that they didn't refill the Heineken Light often enough at the bars during the reception (not a big deal though). The Valet staff could be friendlier, but when my sister arrived, they called her by name right after they opened her door. She asked \"How did you know it was me?\" and they told her that they knew when she was flying in and when she would probably arrive at the hotel. That was an excellent touch!

The bathroom was spacious with first class amenities and thick towels. -- Big screen plasma TV -- Balcony: convenient for smokers since smoking was not allowed inside the room. Now the bad points: Very noisy -- From the construction: workers started around 7:30-8:00 drilling on the rooftop.

The drilling shook walls and was so loud that at checking counter on the first floor, we could not hear what the clerks said. Guest rooms were on higher floor and we were not the only ones complained. -- From hotel service people: on weekend, the sound of live music from ground floor came up the atrium made it impossible for relaxing or sleeping late. In the morning, cleaning and maintenance folks made ruckus dragging service carts on tiled floor in hallways -- From neighbor apartments/condos and the surrounding malls: people yelling and fighting into wee hours, cars screeching and honking. -- Slow internet connection: the hotel claimed to have wireless connection but the signal was so slow that guests had hard time getting connected. The alternatives were to use the business center computer and got charged by the hour or unplugged the TV, used its hardwire connection and got charged also.

The hotel is located right across from Cocowalk, which has some restaurants, shops, and a movie theater and is a popular weekend party spot. There is an Improv comedy club nearby along with a Starbucks, lots of little restaurants, etc.... In the middle of the hotel is an open-air area with lots of plants, trees, vegetation, and fountains and the \"hallways\" to all the rooms are outside as well. This makes for a beautiful setting but in Miami in the summer I personally would prefer an air-conditioned hallway. Also, these \"hallways\" and the individual rooms are tile floored and when you are in your room you can hear noise from outside your room. Assuming my room was typical, the rooms are large and have a large, flat-screen television along with a couch, chair, table & chairs, coffee table, and small outdoor patio with a personal jacuzzi and covered couch. The personal jacuzzi is a nice touch, but I really didn't use it very much. The remote to my television for in-room movies didn't work and I called the front desk to have it replaced. Someone from maintenance came up to the room and rather than replacing the remote, tried to fix something on the back side of the TV to get this feature to start working \"in about 10 minutes\" and left. Watching movies wasn't that much of a priority for me so I didn't call back to say it was still not working, when after 10 minutes it was still not working. The rooms are large, but mine was not a suite. If I had brought my family and had expected/hoped that there would be separate room (like I would get in suite hotels) for my children I would have been disappointed. As a single, business traveler it was fine. I didn't use the restaurant or spa, but otherwise the service was very good. There was an erroneous restaurant charge on my bill that was removed by the front desk person at checkout without any problem. I would certainly recommend this hotel and it is on par with Hilton/Marriott/Doubletree/Hyatt/etc... Finally, there is no pool.

In some ways they were met, but in others we were dissapointed. We booked a suite because we were traveling with our young son and needed the extra space. The room was nicely remodeled with wicker furniture, plasma tv's (2!), luxury bed linens and a spacious bathroom. The hot tub on the deck was very relaxing at the end of a busy day. We specifically asked for a quiet room after having read previous posts about the noise problems. I honestly don't think the staff could have picked a more noisey room for us. We were directly across from a club in Coco Walk and could hear dance music all night in our living room. Thankfully b/c we had a suite we were able to shut the french doors from the living room to our bedroom and cut off some of the noise... if you're booking a regular room however, beware. The lobby of this hotel is beautiful as are all the fountains. The pool was closed for renovation during our stay so I can't comment on that. Most of the staff we incountered were rude with the expection of one very nice male concierge who very graciously brought our luggage to our room, brought us ice for the ice bucket, recomended restaurants for dinner, etc. Too bad all his female counterparts, as well as the front desk staff, had attitudes. They also could not (or would not) accomodate our many requests for an early check-in. Check-in at this hotel is 4pm which I consider rather late. We have a toddler and our mere presence in the lobby while waiting to get into our room seemed to annoy most of the staff. The biggest issue we incountered were ants in our room. Lots of them! We did have snacks in our room for our son, but we made sure we kept them closed up and off the floor. By the second day we were there, they were everywhere. I know this is the tropics but it's still not an issue you expect to deal with at a \"high end\" hotel.

We got a good deal at Travelocity--$159 per night for the Executive Suite, which is the mid range room. The normal cost for this room is $199 per night. I have posted a lot of photos of the hotel. Before booking I called the Mayfair directly and asked about noise problems, construction, etc. I was told that there was no construction in the hotel at this time, but that there was some construction across the street. I also learned that they assign rooms on the day of arrival and that there are more Exec. Suites than any other type of room so if you want to request a \"quiet room\" your chances of getting it would be better with the Exec. Suite. Midday on the day of our arrival I called the Mayfair, told them what time we'd be arriving and requested a king room in a quiet part of the hotel and that is exactly what we got. We were put on the 5th floor at the back side of the hotel which is the farthest away from CocoWalk. We had zero problems with noise from either construction or CocoWalk. I was awakened in the middle of one night by some loud people in the hallway outside the room, but they passed by quickly and I was not disturbed again. My husband didn't wake up at all to this. Our room was also at the end of the hall so we only had neighbors on one side, who we did not hear at all. Things we liked about the Mayfair: Room was very elegant , well appointed and clean. Marble floors were nice for us (though I expect they might be a little cold in the winter..no rugs at all.) Bed was extremely comfortable and the linens were high quality. Good pillows. Flat screen TV was good, liked the way it could be tilted in different directions. Nice to have a couch and chair/sitting area as well as a table and chairs. There was a microwave, small fridge and a safe. Lots of lamps and several were on rheostats so you could adjust the lighting. There were wine glasses and real glass coffee mugs and glasses (not just styrofoam or plastic). Complimentary Miami Herald delivered to the door (though not a full edition, it was still nice to have). There are lots of nice details at the hotel...every exterior door has a large carving that is unique and beautiful (see photos). There are plants everywhere and the hotel has a lovely tropical feel. Fun to ride up in the glass elevator and look out on the open air central part of the hotel filled with plants. Problems and small irritations: Biggest drawback was the inablity to get wireless internet on our laptop in the room. The signal was strong in the lobby on the first floor, but was completely absent in the room. The hot-tub was not the experience I'd hoped for..it is small and when both my husband and I got in together it overflowed and sent water cascading off the balcony. That felt embarrassing and I hoped there was nobody on the balcony below! It was OK but not really roomy enough for 2 people to be comfortable and we only used it the first night. We also only got 2 towels and had to ask for more. They came quickly, but I don't know why they couldn't put 4 towels in the room, especially since there is a hot tub that obviously would require a towel. Also, there are no ice machines and you have to call for ice to be delivered to the room. Being on the 5th floor was good for the noise, but all the lower rooms have thick plants that are growing up the wall beside the balcony so you would have the feel that you were in a jungle. The plants don't make it up to the 5th floor so you look out on a bare wall. Not a problem, really, but something to know. Maybe a 4th floor room on that side of the hotel would be quiet AND have the foliage. On the other hand, in a 5th floor room you don't have anybody in the room above you. And of course, there is no pool at the moment. This was well advertised so we were not surprised and I don't count this against the hotel as a \"problem\" since we knew that going in...I don't know what the hold-up is on the pool as they have been promising one for several years. There must be construction problems. We found the staff to be helpful, generally. The room was made up pretty early. One strange thing was that we followed their instruction to hang up towels if we didn't need them replaced but they always replaced them anyway so we didn't save the environment anything. (With the severe water shortages in Florida we should probably have mentioned this to the front desk.) We had a small problem with an overcharge regarding the valet parking but it was resolved. (We chose to pay $25 for valet parking the first day as we were tired and unloaded our bags and didn't want to hassle with figuring out parking then. The next day we checked out the parking garage across the street and decided to park there for the rest of the time. We were told to tell the valet guys that we were cancelling the service, but this didn't get communicated to the front desk so we were charged for 3 days. My husband dealt with this so I don't know how hard it was to get them to take the charge off, but they did it. ) We didn't eat in the restaurant (Ginger Grove, I think it is called) but some relatives who live in Coconut Grove said that it was very good and they recommend it. I wish we had tried it, but we heard this too late to fit it in. We did try to eat there for breakfast on Monday morning, but they were only serving a $17 buffet which was more than we wanted. We tried the little cafe (not associated with the hotel) directly across the street by the parking garage and didn't like it much. The coffee was terrible and we weren't charged for it. The guy was very apologetic and said we should have complained and he would have made more coffee..that the coffee was usually good so maybe there was a machine malfunction. The food was OK, but everything was on paper plates, paper cups, plastic utensils, etc. and wasn't what we were expecting. Overall, we had a great stay.

We were staying there for one night just before we left on our fantastic Panama Canal 11 night cruise on board the Brilliance of the Seas.

I didn't meet one who deserved to even work at a Red Roof Inn let alone a Spa. When we checked in I was excited to have a manicure~ pedicure ~ and massage before we left on our cruise. Guess what? CLOSED! We asked why they didn't notify us when we called to confirm last week. No reason. No answer. So we got to our room --nice bathroom (but hated the 'rain' shower head I like a water pressure) and changed into our swimsuits to use the TINY hot tub on the patio--- It was empty with about a gallon of dirty water in the bottom ...this inclued dead skin floating in it.

Cannot fathom how it is a member of \"Leading Hotels of the World\" chain... we felt the only decent service we recieved was from valets! We felt that it was a very poor value indeed. Read it and weep... Check in staff was poor: we had to wait a few minutes while she completed some personal chitchat with another employee before she resigned herself to helping us. When asked a question, she immediately referred us to the concierge... who acted like he had not heard us from two feet away. Reception was not welcoming in the least. The room seemed acceptable at first, although certainly not a suite to my mind- one room, with small rather silly patio with tub that requires serious pre-planning. Room was clean, bathroom generously sized, and although the jagged- wall setup was odd we though we'd be ok. How wrong we were... The hotel is ringed by various nightclubs and parking garages, as well as apartments. I'd read reviews here and knew to ask for a quiet room, which I did. Repeatedly. To no effect. Night #1, 3rd floor facing Virginia St. was serenaded until about 5am by drunkards in the streets, music from various bars and clubs, as well as street traffic. No sleep, to say the least... the poorly sealed sliding glass doors were terrific at allowing every footfall and drunken conversation below to transmit. Called front desk at 7am begging for move to quiet room, was told to call back later, after rooms were cleaned. Customer service? Nope, not here- most unsatisfied. Called at 10, got same girl- my check-in buddy, no doubt!- and was told to call much later so she could \"see what she could do.\" Apology for a lousy night's sleep? No. Assurance of help? No. Finally around 3pm I was given a room change- no offer to help move, and I was assured this one would be quiet. Foolish beliver, I moved into a smaller room and thought all would be well- glad to trade a few square feet for a good night's sleep. Incorrect again, more nighttime fun in store... Room #2, 5th floor facing Florida Ave was worse! Nightclub Cielo was pounding along well past 4 am, packed solid and loud as all get out. More street drunks, and plenty of come-and-go traffic from the garage entrance just below us. My DH got up at 2 to see what the racket was and told me the streets were jam-packed with clubgoers, no end in sight. Let me guess- the hotel had no clue? I was given a smaller room, after a hassle, promised quiet, and got garbage. Blissfully the clubs were much quieter on night #3, a Sunday night- but the garage was still doing booming (literally) business. Bed in room #2 was cheap and squeaky, to add salt to the wound. I was so disappointed- we would have slept better at the nearby Courtyard by Mariott and treated better too, just ridiculous. I was disappointed in most every way here- I expected a lovely gracious small hotel with charm and class, and got a poorly managed hotel that charges gladly but serves unwillingly, only when pressed. Other service lows: -bar served over-warmed red wine (75 degrees) in white wine glass... really now, how hard is it to do this right? -staff was cold and never smiled or greeted you, questions were ignored or answered with a monosyllable -concierge seemed disintersted in directing us to locations, giving maps, etc.- simple requests were poorly managed, what would have happened with a large one? We walked to the Ritz Carlton for drinks one night, they provided another world of service- learned and used our name, greeted us courteously, served us well- we were so impressed we stayed for a marvelous dinner and went back to the Mayfair with deep regrets and that unhappy feeling of \"never, ever again!\" Now this is not an unfair comparison, the Mayfair was fairly expensive and a LHW member, which promises a certain luxurious level of service. We feel we paid for far more than we recieved- and the service issues were inexcusable for any property boldly proclaiming its LHW status. I've been treated better in Econolodges! The hotel has a few good points, which I will mention: - good internet service -quick and efficient valet service (but at $25/ day I do expect that) -nice ambiance, and very clean -super easy access to CocoWalk- but mind the nightclubs that adjoin it!!! So if you really like to party up your weekends, you can disco to your heart's content and stagger home with no problem here. If you want gracious service and charm, redirect yourself to another property- the Mayfair will charge dearly but not deliver and you will have all night awake to contemplate your unhappy choice.

We were in bed around midnight and had no trouble sleeping. The only noise I heard was the elevator ding in the morning and that was because our room was directly in front of them. I meant to ask for a room away from the elevators, but forgot to. I found our room very clean and the bed extremely comfortable. We did not use the hot tub on the balcony, although if we had more time we definitely would have, and we did not eat in the hotel restaurant. The outdoor atrium was very nice to relax in. The hotel is perfectly situated in the middle of a cozy neighborhood full of boutique shops and restaurants. We ate dinner at our trusty favorite, the Cheesecake Factory, breakfast the next morning at Green Street and bought a few nice bottles of wine to take on our cruise at the Cheese Market on Main Hwy. We flew into Fort Lauderdale and took an airport limo (ask at the limo kiosk outside the terminal) for $76 flat-rate to the hotel.

We think this was either our 5th or 6th visit and our first since the hotel has undergone renovation. We booked directly through the hotel and had a rate of $159/nite. On previous stays we had paid upwards of $350/nite. I would guess that the rate we paid was due to one of two factors - the rooftop pool had not been completed at that time (a fact that the hotel website clearly mentioned) or it was a special rate to attract guests during a slower time of year. In any case, the hotel, though hosting at least one wedding, didn't seem to be full. The hotel is located right in the middle of Coconut Grove, close to Biscayne Bay. There are many shops, restaurants, and clubs in the area (the hotel is directly across the street from CocoWalk) and the area becomes very lively on weekend nights. Many students from the University of Miami party here on the weekends, so you might want to take that into consideration. Upon arrival, we valeted the car ($25/nite), but there is a parking garage directly across the street as well as street and lot parking in the area. The valet was always quick to bring the car around - we never had to wait long. Check in was friendly and efficient. Although the structural elements of the hotel remain as before, there was definitely a zen-like updating of the lobby/bar area. The five floors of the hotel are centered around an atrium filled with tropical plants and comfortable seating. We had requested a room on the quiet side of the hotel, away from CocoWalk. Our room on the fifth floor (I believe it was called a junior suite) was very large. Soothing calm colors throughout with tile/stone flooring. Very comfortable king size bed with beautiful bedding, a lovely seating area with upholstered loveseat and chairs, great lighting, side and end tables. Very large flat screen TV which could be seen from the bed or the sitting area. On the small private balcony outside the room was a hot tub and a canopy-covered loveseat. The bellman explained the operation of the hot tub to us (it takes about 15 minutes to fill and about an hour and a half to heat, so plan accordingly). The bathroom was very large, with a separate glass-enclosed shower and soaking tub. Plentiful towels and toiletries along with a small TV above the sinks. The lighting was a bit dingy and as another TA reviewer pointed out, the only outlet is indeed tucked up behind the TV. The requisite coffee maker and hairdryer were also provided. There were a few odd elements left from the pre-renovations rooms - a black headboard that had nothing to do with the decor, very dark woodwork that needs to be refinished and an odd shelf/desk? along a wall on one side of the bed with no light or outlets which we eventually used as a luggage rack. We never saw anyone from housekeeping, but the room was always clean, though not entirely spotless. I think the photos on this website provide a pretty accurate portrayal of the hotel public areas and rooms. When it is reopened, be sure to visit the rooftop pool. We always enjoyed the time we spent up there and the beautiful views of the surrounding area. We didn't use the spa or the hotel restaurant. There is a Starbucks across the street which we used for breakfast. Nearby restaurants we tried were the Cheesecake Factory, the Med Cafe and TuTu Tango. Even at 2:30 in the afternoon there were long waits for a table for lunch, but if you eat on the early side in the evening, there seemed to be no waits at all. What really impressed me this trip was the quality, friendliness and attitude of the staff. From the valet to the front desk to the bartenders to the concierge, each and every staff member was there to make sure our stay was up to our expectations.

That being said, it didn't bother us to the point of complaint. The few interactions we had with the staff were very positive, and we found that the service was friendly and efficient. The location of the hotel is ideal, with Cocowalk across the street and lots of restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood.

I've stayed in a several hotels for both business and pleasure, in this place has by far one of the most spacious guest suite layouts of any - with the upgrade (be sure to inquire about this @ the front desk when you check in, as we were able to upgrade for a mere $20/night) the rooms are approx. 600 - 800 sq. feet depending on where the room is located. I would have given this hotel a 5 star excellent rating, but am unable to do so based on two things - 1/ the noise and 2/ the service. The noise is terrible @ night - because of the location of the hotel - it's right across from CocoWalk (which houses a Fat Tuesday's bar - which is partially outdoors in the middle atrium portion of the complex , which also has the CheeseCake Factory, and AMC Theater and some other non-chain restaurants and shops - Coyote Ugly bar is coming so it could be potentially louder here). Knowing the noise was going to be a factor didn't deter us from staying here however, as we had read previous traveler's reviews - so we knew to ask to be on a higher floor (it's only 5 floors - so 4-5) away from the noise (primarily two streets are noiser, the one by CocoWalk Complex and the one that is above the comedy club - Shops @ Mayfair and a loud Cuban restaurant /shop that was playing Calypso type music the entire day @ large decibels). The other reason that I wouldn't say this place is Excellent - although it still is above average is the service. The night manager/or on duty desk person was extremely clueless in our opinion and other's opinions, when at 1:30 am in the morning the fire alarm was going off and the annoucement coming over the loudspeakers was for us to get out of the hotel - via the stairs. After traveling down the stairs with other guests in the hotel - everyone dressed in various states of dress because of the time - we saw the man @ the front desk and he looked at us like he had no idea what we were all doing down in the lobby. I asked him if there was still a need to evacuate and he said, \"no, false alarm\" and that's it....it would have been nice (and really, expected) of him to apologize for the inconvenience and even better, since they had the time to warn us and basically the alarm woke up the entire hotel, they could have sent another message over the loudspeaker informing people that, in fact, it wasn't a false alarm. Other than those couple of examples, the stay was good. The conceriges seem helpful - and they are able to call a cab right away for you - but beware (Diamond Cab was our company) takes you the long way to the airport and doesn't take credit cards - so please plan accordingly if using this cab service. I used it 5 times - since every time the hotel called for the cab it was the same bad driver, poor service available. It comes fast, but you get to your destination slower - as in my opinion, he preys on unsuspecting tourists who don't know the shortest distances or directions etc. Dining tip - The Charthouse -it looks like it's from the same era as the LoveBoat - and you sort of feel like you're on a cruise ship - but the food is wonderful, views amazing - service is so-so, but they still get the crowds because of the view (outside you can sit right overlooking Key Bisaycne Bay).", "Date": "November 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "plantation", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place\u201d", "Author": "clydester", "ReviewID": "UR6026030", "Content": "we stayed at the may fair oct.28th and only spent one night there ,but we wished we could stay longer. we got a suite on the corner and it was way to noisy (be sure to ask for the quiet side) and i called the front desk and they accomadated us immediatly! no questions asked. the rooms all have hot tubs on the balcony and they are very clean! the area in the atrium is VERY relaxing and you could sit there for hours abd hours.. i would definatly recommend theis hotel!!!", "Date": "October 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Eugene, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cOur new Miami home away from home\u201d", "Author": "KenandAimee", "ReviewID": "UR5955695", "Content": "We stayed at the Mayfair for three nights as part of a business trip to Miami.

We actually had two suites (one for us and one for other family members) and both were outstanding. The entire family was impressed with the size and decor of the rooms. Our younger contingent loved the hottub. Every staff member we encountered was pleasant and professional. We did valet the car and it wasn't a problem.

But the last review I read sent me to the cancellation policy, only to discover that I had missed the window by two hours. My daughter and I were stuck and, man, was I apprehensive. I so thoroughly scrutinized every interaction with staff, every corner of the room, every phone call to the front desk that I was driving myself crazy. And, with the exception of some loud conversation at 4 am the second night, the experience was close to perfect. The room was so unique in design, great beds and linens, terrific bathroom (wonderful Grohe rain showerhead), nice layout, nice hot tub on the balcony, ceiling fans....and the decor of the entire place is unlike anything I've seen before. The center atrium is magical. Our experience started when we registered early, since we had an appointment until 8 pm. When we got back to the hotel, the front desk person knew right away who we were, keys were waiting, and our request for a quiet room had been accommodated. We could not figure out how to fill the hot tub -- our call to the front desk was promptly answered and the man sent to help was at our door within 2 minutes. We were always politely greeted, all questions and phone calls quickly answered. The place overall was immaculate and the staff performed just fine. We took other reviewers' advice and parked elsewhere. While there is a parking garage across the street, there are also a number of open parking lots just a few blocks away that charge between $5 - $6 for overnight. The only catch: you have to be out by 9 am, which was not a problem for us. During the day, throughout Coconut Grove, there are blue parking kiosks that give you a slip for your dashboard noting the length of parking time paid for. It is an easy and efficient system but have lots of change; not all the machines take bills. Now, there are some idiosyncrasies about the hotel that might bother some but which added to the quirkiness for us. Yes, the rooms can be dark but we found it restful. I searched for an outlet in the bathroom (coffee pot and hairdryer both provided, so I knew there had to be one!) and it took a day to discover it high up the wall next to the outlett for the bathroom plasma TV. (We moved the coffee pot to the built in desk nook, no problem). If there was one thing I just didn't like, it is that the balcony faces a very ugly concrete wall and there is no view. I cannot figure out the layout of the rooms in the hotel so I guess this is what you get with a quiet room. About that 4 am conversation -- I awoke thinking \"Oh, no, here we go\" but realized I had not closed the doors between sitting and bed rooms. That greatly helped the situation but also gave me an understanding of how the noise carried between balconies and through the open atrium areas outside your door. Fortunately, the conversation, while loud, was short and over quickly. And checkout was accurate and so fast, the valet had not finished turning my car around when we arrived with suitcase. Also he was shocked that I still tipped him -- cannot be the same guy an earlier reviewer encountered. The bottom line -- yes, I would stay here again and anticipate another enjoyable visit -- but only in one of their quiet rooms and only in a suite with two rooms separated by a door. Even then, other patrons conversations might be a problem but I think that is an inherrent design flaw in the layout of the entire hotel. I am willing to take the chance.

The balcony had the sauna and a nice reclining/chair thing that looked like it would have been great to sleep on. The room was highly upgraded, the bedding was AMAZING and the flat screen TV was a GREAT thing. The bathroom was nice and roomy (though I prefer to have the toilet behind a closed door).

Many of the other revewis are correct about this hotel, so I am going to summarize my experience. Great Stuff about Mayfair: 1) Atmosphere. This is a very cool hotel with a lot of character. It has a strong Asian/Pacific design with clean lines, nice flooring, cool fixtures, an open air courtyard in the center that flows into other covered spaces, lots of dark hardwoods, and tropical plants. 2) The Staff. Everyone here was very helpful, anticipated my needs, seemed happy to be working here, and delivered great service. The room cleanup/maid service really went the extra mile. 3) The room. A flat screen TV in the bathroom, bedroom, and living room, Aveda bath products, marble floors, comfortable bed, hot tub outside, and large bathroom are some nice touches. 4) Location. The hotel is right in the middle of coconut grove and is within walking distance of all the great restaraunts and shops. Criticisms of Mayfair: 1) Outside noise. The other posts are correct. If you're staying here while the nearby clubs and bars are busy - you will hear it. The hotel has tried to address this by putting a glass and wood divider door between the bedroom and living room, which helps block out about 85% of the noise. I still got a good nights rest. 2) Internet access. It's horrible!! I NEED internet access when I travel, and the only way to get it at the Mayfair is wirelessly. Because the signal did not reach my room, I had to sit in the lounge to do any work. Frustrating. 3) Parking. I come and go throughout the day and prefer to not valet, so I parked in the garage below. The only way to get up to the hotel was through a hot, small staircase that you had to climb at least 4 levels up to get to the hotel. 4) Hotel or condo? It was kind of weird to only have 1 phone in the whole room, and no book that listed hotel services and amenities. I had to call the front desk to even see if they had a gym. You see signs that advertise mayfair condos, so its confusing. Nothing in my room told me how to access the internet, find the gym, order roomservice, etc. (???) Well that's about it.
