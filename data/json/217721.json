The bathroom was also large and included toiletries, a magnifying makeup mirror and good lighting. The best thing about the bathroom were the towels....they were not those that barely wrap around you and come undone the minute you lift your arms (don't know if anyone else has this problem, but I do!) These were thick towels that wrapped around me one and a half times! Floors in bath area were marble and shower had good pressure. There was a Starbucks adjoining the hotel that you could access right from the lobby which is also roomy but cozy and very traditionally furnished. Elevators were quick and outfitted with dark wood. I stayed on the 11th floor and the workout facility was at the end of the hall.

There's also a Starbuck's coffee outlet as well that's open in the morning. The rooms were smallish. The bath was prosaic. Service was good and dependable. It can best be described as a clean, comfortable place to lay down your head if you happen to need to be on that side of Dallas. We recently joined AAA and Hilton offers discounts for AAA members. The price without taxes was under $170/night. But the parking added $25/night. All in all, it was fairly reasonable. The location, however, was really great. It's near restaurants and high end shopping. And it's not far from highway access. We flew into DFW, which is about 30 to 40 minutes away by car.

Being from Dallas, I liked the fact that this hotel is centrally located in North Dallas, giving easy access to anywhere in the city you would want to go. Another plus are all of the great restaurants within walking distance. This is a charming, intimate Hilton property. The entrance and lobby area are typical of an upscale boutique hotel. The guys who work the valet are very friendly and energetic guys (there was a wedding at the hotel one night and they did a great job of professionally handling the backlog of vehicles). The young and good-looking front desk staff were just okay - they were pleasant, but definitely lacked the finesse of those who have a strong hospitality background. My main gripe with this experience was the room. The room was fine. But I was surprised that in 2009, the room still had an old style tube tv. Most hotels these days have flat screens. I was also disappointed with the hotel's Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries. They offer shampoo and conditioner, but no body wash. And I don't use bar soap. It's odd not to offer body wash; especially given the air travel restrictions with liquids. The room we were given on the 5th floor was located at the very end of the hallway and everytime the room above us would flush their toilet, you could hear the water and what it contained going through the pipes in the walls. Housekeeping did a fair job with the room, although they never did put away the iron board we had left out for 2 days in a row. Also, there were brown smears on the wall just above the toilet (gross!) Overall, this is a lovely hotel that we would stay at again.

This went on for the duration of the shower. After showering I pushed the Guest Services button on the phone. It does not connect you to anything. I then called the Front Desk. The call rang open and was then answered by a reservations agent in another state! She truly wanted to help and asked me to stay on the line. After an eternity she returned to the line and said someone from the hotel would contact me. I was irritated by the scaldings and by no one at the hotel seeming to be around to care. It seems that they will make sure the capture a reservation BUT NOT take care of you once you are there. About 15 minutes later there was a knock at the door. I opened it to find a man in street clothes with no hotel identification, and a woman who appeared to be from the hotel. The man rudely said to me: \"We are here to talk to you.\" He never identified himself at all. It was as if he was the police and I was the criminal whom he intended to interrogate. That really irritated me. I recounted the problem and he went to check the shower. He kept asking me questions in a manner to say to me that \"I do not believe you.\" He then asked brusquely if I needed medical attention. I asked him to leave as I needed to get dressed for the office. He was a jerk. I later told the situation to the Front Desk Clerk on duty and she seemed suprised I had a problem. And, did nothing.

What Every Hotel Should Aspire To!\u201d", "Author": "Travelogue74", "ReviewID": "UR10640809", "Content": "The Hilton Dallas Park Cities is in my opinion the best hotel in Dallas. I have stayed there several times in the past year and plan on staying there exclusively for all of my upcoming trips to Dallas. Firstly, the location is a bit off the beaten path from downtown and the stores and restaurants in the area close in the evening but that is one of the reasons I enjoy this property. It is located in a quite, very nice area of Park Cities just off of the Dallas North Tollway. Unfortunately, this location only has valet parking available but it is not too unreasonable at $18.00 a day - and very convenient as you literally exit your vehicle at the front door of the hotel. What I love most about this hotel is its attention to detail. Upon entering the lobby you feel as if you are in a luxury, boutique hotel. Everything is immaculate, the decor is classy and the hotel staff is extremely efficient, personable and helpful. The rooms are very elegant with high ceilings - at least on the 10th Floor. I have requested the 10th floor ever since because of the extraordinary high ceilings. The decor is very elegant and the room is very inviting. Again, attention to detail is great at this location. Each time I have arrived at this property I have found my bed turned down with chocolates on the pillows, ice in my bucket, with complimentary bottled water awaiting. And, as an even nicer touch, the staff has the clock radio on some kind of smooth jazz station - making your arrival heavenly! The rooms are extremely clean and the bathrooms are great. Very elegant tile floors and a very nice marble sink top grace the bathroom. I must say that the showers are a bit smallish but that is just nitpicking. The bathrooms are also very clean and immaculate. The price is also very reasonable. I believe I have paid from $179 to $249 a night for my stays here. The hotel staff should be commended for keeping up such a great location. I have paid upwards of $600 a night for rooms at places that were nowhere near as good as the Hilton Park Cities. Overall, I recommend the Hilton Park Cities without hesitation. It is classy, clean, elegant, and their attention to detail is outstanding. I easily give this location 5****************** Do yourself a favor and try it when you are in Dallas. It is far superior to any other hotel in the area!", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cStill a good bet for the Park Cities\u201d", "Author": "UTAustin", "ReviewID": "UR10174506", "Content": "I've stayed in this hotel about five times over the last year. I've gone between it and the W Dallas Victory near downtown. I keep coming back to the Park Cities Hilton because it is consistently clean, quiet, and easy to get to. However, if you need wifi or high-bandwidth internet access, you might choose another location. Usually I choose this hotel because I have business both downtown and up near that Galleria. This hotel offers quick access to those two areas, plus Love Field via the Toll Road. The rooms are normal hotel rooms with fairly stylish furnishings. The beds are quite comfortable. The bathrooms are nice, clean, and have good water pressure. The housekeeping staff does a very nice job making sure the bathrooms are clean and well stocked with extra towels. The major problem I run into with the hotel is the internet access. I've never been able to find wifi access and the in-room ethernet leaves much to be desired. You pay a little under $10 a day for the service and it creeps along at a snails pace. It is hit and miss, at best. If you end up staying here you might consider having dinner at the Taco Diner in the Preston Center. It's a short drive or a quick walk from the hotel.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flower Mound", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely INCREDILBE!\u201d", "Author": "balvarez", "ReviewID": "UR10067269", "Content": "From the time I booked this reservation for our anniversary to when we recieved the bill, everything was flawless!

I had specifically ordered champagne and strawberryies to be delivered without my wife's knowledge and they were when we were at the bar. How did they know when we weren't there? Very nice touch. We had requested an extra pillow and it seemed that when we hung up the phone, the young lady was knocking at the door. She was very gracious and asked if there was anything else she could have done. There wasn't. The next morning, we went to the restaurant for breakfast and it was incredilbe. You HAVE to try the waffles! We requested a late depature time and they were happy to accomodate us.

It feels more like a boutique hotel than a typical Hilton, with elegant decor and attentive service. The hotel gym was being renovated when I visited, so I was given a free pass to Gold's Gym (about a block away), along with a hotel towel to use for my workout and a lock for the gym's lockers. I visited the hotel bar to watch some football, and the bartenders were all very good. The food was excellent -- a pleasant surprise for a hotel bar. I highly recommend the house salad, which comes with beets. Delicious! The concierge level snacks and breakfast items were better than most Hilton hotels' offerings. The turndown service is a nice surprise -- chocolates left on my pillow, along with the next day's weather forecast. The room's radio was on and tuned to classical music, and I found ice and two complimentary bottles of water provided each day. The hotel is right in the thick of some good shopping and restaurants. I grabbed lunch at Pei Wei (an Asian diner/bistro with low prices and quick service) and sincerely enjoyed that. Within a short walk are CVS, Ross, and Marshall's. The only complaint I have is that the hotel internet service (which is around $9 a day, if I remember correctly), was SLOW, SLOW, SLOW.

Anyway, whie not a Four Seasons, it's WAY above an EconoLodge or anything like that. Very good deal for the price.

He told me that I was not in the room that I had told him but another. I explained that he was wrong and he insisted that I was the one wrong, he made me go up to the wrong room just to prove it. Then when I came back and told him, he actually wanted to move me again. I finaly got to my room and found the extra key in the envelope which had my room # on which proved the manager wrong... He never called to apologize. The hot tub was out of order my whole trip. In the mornings the hot water would just stop working.
