The door was jimmied open. The locks on the doors are condusive to being open with a shim. The person managing the front desk was completely unresponsive saying that \"this had never happened before\", but that there is nothing that they could or would do about it. It was not until an attractive young lady came to the desk to report her room had also been broken into that the gentleman at the front desk decided to pay attention to the complaints. He then called the police who did nothing. The attitude by the hotel management was \"this happens\" and \"this is Rome.\" The security system at the front desk did not record any unknown persons entering or leaving the convent. And because there is only the front entrance, it could only be concluded that the robbery was done by a guest or, more likely, the staff. The staff knows who is in or out of their room since you leave your key with the front desk. I am returning to Rome this year for a few days and will not stay here again. I have found other accomodations which are better than this convent at a comparable price. I recommend that people look elsewhere to stay.

It's such a good home base and you can walk to Trastevere for dinner or there are some good little places to eat up the street too. Close to a couple little shops to buy necessities and things too. Really quiet on this street, which was especially good on New Years Eve. You feel far enough away from the craziness, but close enough to get to it all too. I really didn't care about the small bathrooms...considering it's Europe and my room had an actual shower with doors, I thought it was better than most.

We paid 90 euros a night, with breakfast included. The breakfast is continental but there are several choices, including pastries, cereal w/ milk, slices of ham and cheese, yogurt and fruit (apples when we were there). Coffee is excellent, served in a small pot to your table with another pot of hot milk. The rooms are of course very small, two twin beds that are relatively comfortable. I still put the extra blanket under my sheet for more cushion. The fluorescent lighting is a bit harsh, so if you want to read while your roommate sleeps, bring a reading light. The closet is large enough with hangers and 2 large drawers. Bathroom is also very small, especially the shower. If you are over 6 foot and more than say 250 pounds, then you may have trouble. The doors open inward which makes it difficult to enter/exit if you are a big person. The water was very hot though. The internet is not free. 2 euros for 30 minutes, 3 euros for an hour, but it was fast and there is a b/w printer for your use. Safety deposit box is free. Location is great, about 300 yds from St. Peters square. There are several good restaurants nearby and small shops to get any necessities. I bought a 4GB media card for 15 euros, which is way cheaper than those souvenir stands. The small pan y dolce place near the corner had great porchetta sandwiches. The 64 bus stop is at the end of the block near the tunnel or better yet, another stop is about a 100 yards up on Via Della Fornaci. The desk scheduled us a ride to the airport, which was 43 euros for two people. The showed up right on time in a comfortable mercedes van.

The bus station is a block or two away for transport around the city on the Red 64 bus. There is no doubt, we would stay here again. Friendly staff (especially the gentlemen that worked the afternoon/evening shift) well kept building on a peaceful street with plenty of restaurant choices whether it be a snack or a full \"Cena\", (dinner) there was a little of everything including a direct view of the Vatican from the doostep. The whole place has a welcoming, mellow and quiet atmosphere. Rooms were perfect. We had very comfortable twin beds, which was ample for busy days of sightseeing and sleeping like a log . Having said that, know and like the person you are sharing this room with, it's cozy in there! The tv was not missed, the room (213) had a big window with no screen that provided a great sleepy breeze at night, giving us the best sleep of our 12 day trip. Woke everyday to noticeable but not alarming church bells and relaxed in the afternoon to Italian children playing basketball in the neighboring schoolyard, both made for a great soundtrack. The bathroom is small by American standards, but more than adequate. My husband is a big guy and was comfortable in the shower. Great water pressure too which felt great at the end of long day of sightseeing. The room includes a huge armoire with drawers and a desk and plenty of accessible outlets and available WIFI access (for a fee). We found that it had everything we needed to enjoy Rome at a great value with the bonus of a cultural significance. Casa Marie serves a plentiful \"colazione\" or breakfast every morning starting at 7:30. Italian meats, cheeses, fruits, yogurt, granola and various cereals, biscotti and of course hot coffee.
