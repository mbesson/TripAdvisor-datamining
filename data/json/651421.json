{"Reviews": [{"Content": "nice Wina Holiday Villa Bali Found what we knew was a decent deal on travelfinger.com. The write up put us in the picture so we had a rough idea what to expect, especially after reading some of the reviews. Me and my girlfriend love surfing and that\u9225?what we went for.The hotel is 5 mins from the beach which is fine, but a ride from the centre of Kuta \u9225?which is fine, because it can get lively there at night. That said, Pantai kuta and Benasari are close. Both are good for shopping and eating.The overall feeling of the place is pleasant, its Balinese architecture and kept clean.The staff were nice, friendly and courteous; always smiling.The rooms are very spacious with a balcony, clean and comfortable. Yes the bathrooms aren\u9225\u6a9b great but we have stayed in worse. Don\u9225\u6a9b drink the water, stick with the hotel\u9225\u6a9a bottled stuff. Also don\u9225\u6a9b rely on the hot water supply. Breakfast was a bit sparse; you have to work a bit to find and get what you want.Overall, we enjoyed it.", "Date": "Dec 28, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR686232272", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "rik_build"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297697-d651421-r23057364-Bali_Merita_Villa-Kuta_Bali.html", "HotelID": "651421", "Price": "$245"}}
