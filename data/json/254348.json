What stands out the most about this hotel is the mind blowing hospitality. Every time we asked the front desk staff for anything, they could not do enough to help us - we asked where something was and 2-3 staff would be checking and double checking maps, sharing their opinions and more. Everything they recommended was a complete hit. They were all so dedicated to ensuring we found what we needed, and it was so very much appreciated! Of equal importance was the location - a short walk to the cobblestone streets in the Old Port & all of its shops, bars & restaurants, while also a short walk to the Metro, the wonderful Notre Dame Basilica & light show and some great restaurants on the same street or one street over. The rooms were really spacious and the modern, Warhol-esque pop art all around was super fun. The lobby was also a chill place to talk & hang out, and also where I discovered how much I loved a loved a local beer that the staff recommended. They also had a Brazilian band one night during happy hour, which was a nice touch. We also really enjoyed visiting the Botanic Gardens - especially the Japanese Gardens within; eating smoked meat & Poutine; shopping Rue St. Denis & Rue St. Laurent, and nightlife in Le Village. The most beautiful colorfully painted and landscaped townhouse I've ever seen I found en route from Rue St. Denis to Rue St. Laurent. In old Montreal, a drink at the rooftop bar above Hotel Nelligan is great for happy hour/sunset if it's nice out and quite a busy scene. L'Express had totally delicious French food & not too pricey. Had to make a reservation in advance. Le Nil Bleu is an Ethiopian restaurant that the concierge recommended & I went but they had closed for lunch so I missed it. I never went to St. Elizabeth's pub but my friend Bobby went & said it has an amazing vibe.

I was told that although fridges are common in the suites at this hotel, they aren't generally included in regular rooms (which is what I had); just something to clarify/confirm with staff if a fridge is important to you during your stay. I didn't have breakfast at the hotel, so can't comment on that.

First of all the location is very good for business or leisure. You're close to the water, have many great attractions within walking distance and are also well served by nearby public transport. I didn't drive, but noted a popular open air parking lot directly behind the hotel. There is a bike hire stand just up the street which I made use of (not operational in the winter months) and found to be a great way to see the city. There are some wonderful places to eat nearby. I highly recommend lunch or dinner at Ferreira Cafe, which was a real highlight of my trip. As you ascend the steps into the hotel, if you're like me you'll probably head to the obvious desk at the top. Wrong! This was the concierge desk and for the bar. Just to the right was the 'front desk'. Check-in with swift and friendly. It was explained that Wi-fi was complimentary, but breakfast is an option extra, I passed on breakfast during my stay as I like to check out local spots. My superior room was very nicely appointed. It wasn't huge, but perfectly fine for a lone traveller like myself. If I were a couple, I might pay the extra and get a suite. I walked past a few while they were being cleaned and they appear much more spacious. As other mention, big windows and high ceiling make the rooms very bright and airy. The bed was good and noise was minimal at all times. My only real complaints were the lack of free power outlets in my room. The only free one I could find was under the writing desk and a bit fiddly to get to. Accessing another one required unplugging a lamp. The television (which I don't really care about) also suffered from a fairly grainy picture quality, which seems to be an issue at many hotels for some reason. Some people may find the hotel a bit light on services and amenities, the room service is minimal and there are no fridges/minibars in the rooms for example. I spent a bit of time at the bar. During the week it was very quiet, but perhaps gets busier at the weekend. The prices aren't exactly cheap, but also not horrendous. The selection of wines and beers are very good, food choices are minimal. The service was warm and friendly, the bartender told me that the building was formally a bank, the beautiful wooden staircase you see in the bar is original and adds to the grandness of the room and all its wonderful artwork.

Our room was luxuriously large. I don't know that all the rooms are as big, but I do understand they all have super-high ceilings as ours did. The room was also immaculate - from the linens to the bathroom. I usually have a hard time walking barefoot in hotel rooms, but felt comfortable doing so here. (The only little things were a burn mark and small stain on the carpet, and the armchair in the room was a bit threadbare. Also water pressure could have been better). The general decor of the hotel is really upbeat and modern. We had an enormous Beatle's canvas hanging above the bed. And the walls were painted a cheery yellow. Also, we never once heard our neighbors. And for the first time in a long time, there were plenty of pillows on the bed - all soft. The location is great - such a close walk to Montreal's Old Port. Just don't expect everything to be open on weekends as it's pretty much a business district (meaning many things are shut Saturday and Sunday) - but regardless, we found plenty of things to do and eat in the area. There's also a nearby subway. And we were able to walk to Chinatown as well. It's also very close to one of our favorite sites, the Notre-Dame basilica. The hotel also offers a lounge area where you can order a drink if you want, or just hang out (which is good, because the drinks are expensive). We noticed that on the Friday of our arrival, there was a bossa nova band playing during happy hour. We missed the show, but thought it was a nice touch. Also, in general, we found the staff to be very kind. Breakfast and parking, however, are both a bit of a ripoff. Friends who were traveling with us had a miscommunication regarding whether breakfast was included in the cost of the room and were upset to learn - after having eaten, that it was not. So be sure to be clear about this before eating. (Also, there is only very limited room service). My complaint about parking is that there are many lots around the hotel that have far lower parking rates. If you're comfortable parking overnight in an open air lot, then don't bother using the hotel service which is $22 per night.

It is a more plush hotel than we would normally choose, as we normally abide by our \"going to see the sights not the hotel room\" mantra. However, this was a special occasion! We flew in from Toronto, and caught the 747 Express Bus from Trudeau Airport to downtown, getting off at Jeanne-Mance We then walked about 10 minutes to L'Hotel on Rue St Jacques. If you have larger bags it would be a little tedious - we had cabin-sized luggage. We came to soak up the old port area so we did not even consider taking a car. However, the public transit system is excellent if you want to explore further afield. Hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful, and the room was fabulous! It was beautifully furnished and clean and tidy throughout our weekend. There is no pool, which would have been nice after a long day on one's feet! We had the Edward Ruscha suite which was very spacious. L'Hotel promotes itself as an exhibit of contemporary art, hence the link to Ruscha. Unfortunately the weekend we stayed was the weekend they chose to remove 99% of the art work (for inventory reasons?) so many of the walls in the hallways and foyer were bare. We chose to walk everywhere and there is plenty to visit within minutes of L'Hotel. We did not eat at the hotel; instead we visited local cafes and restaurants - so many to choose from! We thoroughly enjoyed breakfast at March\u00c3\u00a9 de la Villette on Rue St Paul West at Rue St Pierre, which we found Parisienne in atmosphere. Plenty of apparently regular patrons coming and going gave it an authentic feel. On our last day the staff happily stored our luggage while we went to enjoy the warm autumn day by the port.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhinebeck, New York", "Title": "\u201cA boutique hotel with an amazing location\u201d", "Author": "Lpfetzer", "ReviewID": "UR119990650", "Content": "Columbus Day Weekend was the perfect time to travel to Montreal.

The Old Port area can be enjoyed just by strolling through the streets. The shops and restaurants are great.

After walking around and passing the other hotels we had looked at online, I am convinced that this is the best locations in Old Montreal, as it is an easy walk to all of Old Montreal but also a skip away from the Metro to explore other parts of the city. The beds were comfortable, rooms were nicely furnished, spacious, and very clean for an older hotel. They offered a healthy continental breakfast that was perfect considering all of the rich food that came later in the day. The amazing art collection on display throughout the hotel is something my husband is still glowing about. The downside to this otherwise exceptional hotel was the service we experienced. First, we had reserved an executive king suite overlooking the street (on the phone directly with the hotel), and when we arrived they told us that there weren't any left. They put us in a queen suite facing the interior courtyard,. They did comp breakfast. The next morning we requested that they deliver a DVD player to our room before lunchtime so we could watch our wedding video as we rested. We had to ask a second time in the late afternoon. The girls at the desk that afternoon sent us to a terrible restaurant (a Greek restaurant on King Arhur, I believe). They gave us terrible directions to drive to Mount Royal, did not tell us where the parking lots were located or that there were barely noticeable pay kiosks in the lots. All of this would have been extremely helpful. Our car was absolutely filthy when they brought it to us out of valet parking (we could barely see out the windows) and the valet simply shrugged and offered a barely audible \"sorry.\" They sent us to the wrong pier for the classic boat show (about a 15 minute walk and the opposite direction from where it was). Then the morning we checked out, they told us to go enjoy breakfast and they would retrieve our car and load our bags. They had difficulty finding our keys (it took about 5 minutes), then they waved us on our way with a smile. Thank goodness my husband thought to check the trunk before we pulled away because it was empty! They were extremely embarassed and apologized profusely (as they did throughout our stay). A few other minor inconviences (i.e. coffee cups that did not fit the lids which resulted in spilling my coffee all over my slacks). A comedy of errors perhaps. My overall sense is that the extemely young staff simply didn't have much experience in and around Montreal and did not have much first-hand knowledge of the city. I'm assuming the girls had never been to Mount Royal or dined in any of the ethnic restaurants that we wanted to experience. One gentleman, Francois, was extremely helpful during our stay and seemed to have more knowledge than the rest of them combined. Thank you Francois! We will return to this hotel for many reasons (the charm, the art, the location), but will do our own research and find recommendations for dining and playing before we arrive at the hotel. We have travelled around the world and this could have been one of our better hotel experiences. Management, please re-train your staff and educate them on the city, and this little gem could be truly amazing.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cRomantic Getaway....All thanks to Lhotel!!\u201d", "Author": "LOVE2TRAVEL64", "ReviewID": "UR117080830", "Content": "My husband and I travelled to this wonderful hotel for our 9 year anniversary and we couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate.

This hotel is in the PERFECT location, 2 minutes exactly to TWO different Metro entrances. Ask the staff for a small metro map, it was really handy!

About 10min gets you at the ferry docksand Science or Archeology museums. From the 747 airport bus drop off (8$, there is a ticket machine that makes change now) it is about 15min walk dragging your luggage through the Chinatown area and past some homeless, but they don't trouble you at all. Taxi ride back to airport cost 38$ and without traffic was 20min. There was always a front desk staff of about three people, never a wait. Spoke perfect English, and with their accents I believe perfect French as well. Extremely welcoming, patiently answered every question and with a smile, assisted with restaurant reservations. Coming in the door they would typically welcome me with a free bottle of cold water. Check in/check out was immediate and flawless. Room 206 was large and spotless, extremely high ceiling. Free wireless internet extremely fast and easy to connect. Bed extremely comfortable. Curtains would black out sunlight. Mini fridge in the room, LCD TV. Air conditioning worked perfectly and was quiet. No special view from my room, off a quiet street. Anything not perfect? Well, the toilet could have a more powerful flush (maybe a Montreal or personal thing?) and the public computer you can use for free to print out airline boarding passes was old and slow. Lighting in the room a little dim. Nothing preventing a 5/excellent rating. Also not the place to stay if you are looking for a big bar or pool scene. I did not try the breakfast or any type of room service. I was originally going to stay at the Auberge du Vieux Port (which seemed very nice) but I saved over $40/night by choosing the LHotel.

There is art all over the place, and if this is your kind of thing, it may be worth the premium you'll pay to stay there -- but if not, the hotel itself is a decent but not great place to stay. The location in Old Montreal is very convenient to the (very expensive) shops, restaurants, and bars on Rue St Paul and Rue de la Commune, but also to two subway stops (Square Victoria & Place d'Armes) for access to the rest of the city. A great part of town to be in if you don't mind spending some money or want to be out late -- even in the middle of the week, many of the bars were open a lot later than we were, so this might improve the 'value' part of the equation for the right set. But it's tough to justify the price for the hotel itself: the decor (including some of the art) is very modern and in some cases downright tacky. Our 'Superiore' room (the least expensive) was very small, though mostly still quite comfortable. The bed seemed very much on the small side for a Queen and was adequate but not especially comfortable. The view was the parking lot and dilapidated building next door, though a lot of Old Montreal is like that -- beautiful buildings on one block and run-down buildings with 'a louer' (for rent) signs the next. The exception to the value is the staff, all of whom were tremendously helpful and friendly during our 4-night stay. We didn't need a whole heck of a lot but found everyone from the doorman to the concierge a pleasure to talk to. So even if the hotel gave us the impression that it was a little too cool for us, the staff made up for it.

I discovered L'Hotel quite by accident while exploring Old Montreal last January. The Botero and Dine sculptures which frame the entrance to this beautiful 19th-century former bank building aroused my curiosity . After my second champagne cocktail in the lobby bar I knew I had to spend the weekend in this beautiful space before returning home to Toronto. The staff - young, hip and cool - made my stay very pleasant. From check-in to check-out, the service throughout the hotel was attentive, very friendly and most helpful. (A special thanks to Danielle, Francois, Mylene, Nikolaus and Raphaele!) The room was very large and inviting - 12-foot ceilings, (faux?) antiques, 50\" LCD television with large original abstract canvases gracing two walls. The king-size bed was firm, with crisp linens. The bathroom was Deco-inspired - a study in black-and-white. The breakfast room had the ambience of a latticed conservatory. The buffet breakfast was very good and the service staff welcoming. (Breakfast was an additional $20 charge - no complaints here.) But really - all of what I have just reported is secondary to The Main Event: the multi-million dollar collection of Modern Art - mostly Pop Art - that graces all of the public rooms and corridors - more than 200 original works on permanent display. If you ever imagined what it would be like to sleep inside MoMA or the Tate Modern - here's your chance to find out. True, many of the works would benefit from a larger display venue - but this is a small boutique hotel we're talking about. These works surround you, enfold you, inspire you. Frankly, I'd have grabbed at the chance to stay here even if sleeping bags were the only beds offered. Did I mention that the room rate for this 4-star accommodation was just $139/nt.Cdn? Thank you M. Marciano (the owner) for sharing these stunning works of art wiith us. Thank you, L'Hotel, for your warm welcome. I look forward to my next stay with you.

LHotel was ideally located and easy walking distances to all of Old Montreal (everything within about 1KM radius) and a host of dining options, as well as a short walk to Victoria Square and even St Catherine St for shopping. We had a deluxe superior room at $150 CA per night, comparable to most other hotels in the area. The room was spacious and comfortable. The only drawback (especially being late fall and short days) was that the hotel uses high efficiency flourescent lamp bulbs (admirably) and night time lighting was a bit dim. The staff was exceptional -- friendly, and always helpful. The hotel was quiet and very clean and well kept. The lobby lounge offers a great place to sit and relax. The only disappointment with the lounge is that they did not have a wine list, though did have wine, nor a scotch list, thought they had scotch. The night manager set a price for the wine and a glass of scotch. The Scotch as Macallan 18 yr and $20 per glass, not at all unusual for that Scotch. However, the wine was a California wine (can't even recall the label) that was the only Cabernet available and retails at about $15 US, for which we were charged $65 (and did not see that price until we had the bill). We chalked it up to poor planning on our end, but we are regular wine drinkers and there were two deficiencies here: a scant and poorly selected wine list (nothing of quality available) without clear pricing ahead of time, and in my mind a significantly overpriced wine for a very mediocre (at best) wine. These are things I am responding to the hotel to address, they are easy to remedy with a little attention, and I am sure the hotel can find a reasonable balance on the price of some better (or even this) wine.

The front staff team were great too - not as professional or as experienced as the staff at my first hotel, but they certainly were friendly.

From reading guidebooks about the city, we decided we wanted to stay in Old Montreal or Plateau section of town. We picked this hotel because of its kitchsy vibe and location, as well as reasonable rates for a four star hotel. First of all, the basics. The hotel and rooms are extremely clean and well kept. Our room was a bit dark, but that didn't bother us much. Also, the lobby and halls are lined with valubale and interesting works of modern art. This may not appeal to everybody, but for us it was really cool to sleep with an original Roy Lichtenstien and Andy Warhol right outside your door. Furthermore, for a walking city, its in the perfect location. 5 minute walk to old montreal, 15 minutes to St. Catherine (main shopping district), and 25 min to Plateau. We were able to hit all the high points of the city, and amazing restaurants, without taking the car (except for a visit to Mount Royal, which definately requires a car). Some negative points. Parking is ridiculous in that area of town, and the hotel charges $25 per day to use their valet. All they do is park the car in a garage down the street for you. The staff is polite, but not really super friendly or helpful. We learned to ignore their restaurant suggestions after a couple of days. Its better to ask a friendly local for recommendations, as the staff tends to send you to more touristy places. There is also a bar in the lobby, but after a week, my partner and I had no idea when it was open or how to order drinks. And finally, for the price we were charged, we weren't really impressed with the accomodations. One note, there is a tobacco/convenience store half a block from the hotel, run by a Lebanese gentleman named Ibrahim.

Notre Dame is right down the street, subway stations are a block or two away, and the sites of old port is a quick walk, a great location to get to just about everything the city has to offer. We arrived at the hotel early not expecting to check in at 11:30am but hoping and prepared to. We were told to return in an hour or two and that our room should be ready. When we got back at 2:00pm as instructed, our room wasn't ready as promised and we were given our room key and told that we needed to come back after 3pm. We arrived back at the hotel for the 3rd time at 3:15pm only to be greeted by a housekeeping cart blocking our hotel room and the maid stating that she needed more time to finish. So basically it took them 4 hours to get to our room ready - unacceptable! We did voice our disappointment at the desk and they apologized, it sounded like as if the guests in the room prior to our arrival prolonged thier stay unexpectedly - not our fault. Finally when we got into the room the carpet had a burn stain from an iron dropping on the floor - for this kind of hotel that should not be there - why didn't maintenance fix this? So our start to this hotel didn't go well however our weekend in Montreal far outweighed these two minor disappointments. Again, it's location, location, location! There are options that are very close to this hotel such as the St. James and the Place de Armes but these hotels are pricer than the Lhotel so the value is better. Imagine our dismay when the following day upon returning around 4pm and our room was again blocked by the housekeeping cart and the maid again stating she needed more time to finish up. Even at that, the room was missing towels which were quickly gathered up by a very willing housekeeper from the room next to ours. Our room was a superior double queen room (room 316) tucked in the corner with no view but the drab interior courtyard. The room was very quiet whereas a street view room potentially could be noiser/sunnier, so our sleep was very restful. The room had a nice bath with shower and deep tub.

They wanted to split up our party into several different hotels, including some up to a mile away. Their only concession was to offer one-way cab fare to the new hotels. Absolutely unacceptable. It was only after standing our ground for some time at the front desk, did they miraculously find accommodations. We also saw this same thing happen to several other guests, who were being ushered out the door (even late at night) after arriving on international flights. WHO NEEDS THAT - when you've made reservations! Also, their hospitality is spotty - one of our party got coupons for breakfast in the hotel - others did not even though we all paid the same room price. The breakfast cost $12 and was not worth it at all - a few low-quality pastries, some cereal, a few slices of cheese/ham on a plate, and a waitress that was hard to find when it came time for coffee refills. Go right across the street to the cafe for half the price and twice the quality. On a positive note, the hotel itself is in a good location, the rooms are spacious and spotless, the staff was friendly and it was quiet at night.

There where a few minor issues which prevent me from giving the room a perfect score : I would have liked the Economic room to have a compact refrigerator included even if it is the best priced room. It would have been nice to have a vending machine and ice machine available in the hotel. On the first morning, the maid woke us up at 8:30 in the morning to see if she could clean the room which is way to early. And finally, the room was supposed to include wireless internet access but they where having problems with it.

I was impressed by the entrance and lobby and check-in was fast, by a very helpful staff member. I was also very impressed by the decor of the room: the interior decorating was lovely. A few quibbles: for one, it might have been fixed if I had stayed more than one night, but I found that the room was too hot; I prefer to sleep with a room at ~17\u00c2\u00b0C (as that is usually easy to achieve in the winter), but no matter how far I turned down the thermostat the room was a hot 23\u00c2\u00b0C.

Also, I found the matress too hard, although my colleague, in their room, found their's too soft so I guess it was the luck of the draw.

The hotel is great on the outside, in a good location in Old Montreal, walking distance to all. The lobby is \"okay\" (read details below) The rooms were clean and decent, nothing special, slightly generic. I would consider it again, and I have no major complaints.......We stayed 4 nights over Thanksgiving. The hotel was close to full, but we hardly heard or saw anyone. HOWEVER, to be detailed and give my HONEST opinion, and just to be clear, this is not a so called \"Boutique\" hotel in any sense other than its small, and a bit quaint, and it ends there. I have been around to 20 countries and stayed at many \"small\" or \"Boutique Hotels\" and this one is okay, and clean, but wouldn't vote it into one of the \"worlds best small hotels\" listings. Things I didn't like-personal observations: The hotel employees had ugly uniforms, with bad name-tags, like they were working at a Denny's or I-hop-overall just tacky. Yet, the employees were friendly, very helpful and lovely. The entire interior design of the hotel looked like a mix of what a bunch of owners and others said they liked, all mixed together without a professional decorator to help-sorry. The art & sculptures of the hotel both on the outside and inside were STUNNING and \"made\" the hotel. Without them, it would have been drab. The \"continental breakfast\" was okay, basic. The breakfast room was nice and the breakfast staff was very helpful and sweet. Some REAL Croissants for breakfast would be nice, and some real breads? Not frozen cheap ones. I mean Montreal is FULL of great French bakeries! The music in the breakfast room, and hotel was HORRENDOUS. It was the WORST ever-think bad elevator music everywhere~no wonder no one sits in the bar either? You would think the management or owners would consider the LACK of atmosphere or originality or personality for that matter in the lounge, entrance, bar areas, and that they would wonder what they are doing wrong, and that it is empty. It's not inviting or interesting. The music at worst, should be something current (not bad 80's-90's elevator music) even some simple music like: relaxation, chill out, symphonic, zen atmospheric, French? Did anyone think \" hey, lets have some FRENCH classics, French Jazz, or French chill out to add to the French thing happening here in Quebec?\" For the tourists at least? Now that's a thought! The hotel COSTES in Paris, France makes the BEST mixed CD's for just that, just buy and play-problem solved! The rooms were okay, the bedding was nice enough, the mattress was decent. The bathroom was clean and nice. Overall the room was decent and clean, it was like a upscale Holiday Inn I guess or a Hilton somewhere...some basic design skills could have made the rooms MUCH nicer to look at, Colors, and fabrics, etc. They were clean enough, just generic. Overall, I would stay again for a good rate, otherwise I would spend a bit more and stay in a real \"Boutique\" hotel. Its too bad as the location is great and the building is really beautiful. The layout and size is nice, its just generic, and not unique. With a few simple changes, the place could be great. PS-Some real Croissants for breakfast would be nice, and some real breads?

But I still advise finding a restaurant.

Cons -Contrary to what the hotel's website says, it is NOT in the HEART of Old Montreal. It's actually on the far NW corner, right on the border with downtown Montreal proper. -Because the hotel is downtown, the streets are DEAD after work hours and on the weekends. So no places to shop or eat out during those times. -The free Wi-fi network is UNSECURE. So user beware. It also cut on and off on me a few times.

I could see a little bit of the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montreal from my bedroom window though. -Only one VERY slow elevator. Take the stairs down.

However the noise wasnt so bad that it would have gotten annoying and id have to go complain. 2nd issue is that it was impossible to seet he television from the bed, so if you are like me who needs little TV to fall asleep this might be a small issue.

It was the dead of winter but the plate included mango, papaya, blueberries, strawberries, apples, grapes, bananas and kiwi. The crepes and California eggs benedict were very tasty.

The hotel location was great, within short walking distance to the metro, restaurants and Basilique Notre Dame. It also was within walking distance of the shops on rue St. Catherine.

I recommend this hotel for its location: not only are you on the edge of Vieux Montreal and in walking distance of all the historic (and tourist) sights, but you are also just a few blocks from the Metro which will take you downtown shopping, out to the Botanical gardens or over to \"restaurant row\". Speaking of food, we did not eat breakfast in the hotel (too pricey), choosing instead, to walk a short block to \"Eggspectations\" -- a fun, funky eatery that will serve you any breakfast food -- American, Candian, French, other -- you desire. (Try the Brioche Beauty!) Don't jump -- as I did -- to a negative conclusion when the front desk staff recommends a restaurant. It was Friday night , we returned to the hotel late and couldn't get a reservation anywhere else. Reluctantly, we let them book us at Bistro Boris.

It was just a place to spend some time while waiting for the fireworks. The Botanical Gardens was huge and beautiful.

Bathroom is very clean and, unlike an earlier report, we had no problem with the hand shower as it is easy to place it in the holder and use as a fixed shower to wash your hair. The location Vieux Montreal is outstanding in terms of quiet, charm (be sure to go inside the two historic bank buildings in the neighborhood) and terrific places to grab a cafe and pastry. The best part of this hotel is the very helpful front desk staff, particularly a young woman named Sandy. She gave us great recommendations for places to eat and tour; and directed us via drawing on a map and/or telling us which Metro line and stop to use. She also made dinner reservations for us. Her patience, good humor and genuine desire to find out whether we enjoyed her suggestions makes her an excellent customer service provider. Thank you Sandy! I disagree with some of the other reviewers who say the hotel was lacking a certain something. I would be very happy to stay here again and recommend it to anyone who prefers a place with elegant charm.", "Date": "October 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, BC, Canada", "Title": "\u201cYou Certainly Won't Forget Your In Montreal...\u201d", "Author": "GlobalEyes", "ReviewID": "UR4041067", "Content": "You know, I kind of forgot I was staying at a hotel when I stayed at Hotel XIXe Siecle in Old Montreal. The first thing one notices is that the lobby doesn't feel like a lobby. You walk up a short flight of stairs and there's a sitting area with a charming, little bar on the side. The interesting artwork, comfy couches, shelves of books and winding staircase welcome guests as if they're at a house, rather than a hotel. And if you're away from home, this is kind of nice, right? The room I stayed in was just massive. It must have been about 600 square feet and with a 20 foot ceiling, and I'm not exaggerating one bit. I was told it was an upgrade because they were quite busy - not bad at all. I'd imagine you might not find such a size on the other floors, so go for the first level if you can - more space never hurts the weary traveller. The bathroom is a bit tight given the fact the room, itself, is so large. There's absolutely no counterspace, so a definite thumbs down to the hotel developer/designer on this one.

However, it was not the sort of bar you would want to stay in for long, and indeed most people left after a brief while - no doubt to explore retaurants and bars in the Downtown and Vieux Montreal areas. Breakfast was lovely; generous and very tasty. The various fruits in particular were excellent. I would stay here again. The subway was nearby and allowed easy access to anywere you wanted to go.

The property was well decorated in a quassai 20's style. The Room; Very clean, good sized room with a very comfortable bed. Tall ceilings with windows to match. Bath was new and the toiletries great. My only complaint is the hand held showerhead. These things are truly hand-held. There is no option of mounting it so you can wash your hair. I hate these things. After several weeks of this kind of showerhead in South East Asia and Europe, I hoped I would never see one again. Alas, the hotel Siecle had them. Aside from this little thing, I had no other complaints about the bathroom. The towels were exceptionally large and fluffy. The room was very clean and comfortable. For those who smoke, the 3rd floor of the hotel Siecle is their smoking floor. Much to our delight there was no odor. This is the only hotel in Old Montreal that allows smoking. Staff: The staff was always courteous even when they were very busy. We felt pampered and well taken care of for the 3 days we were there. Directions were always given with a smile, a highlighted map, and in perfect English. Parking: Valet parking is about $20 (Canadian) per day and well worth it. Those who travel know that paying extra for parking in any downtown metropolitan area is to be expected. The valet was always prompt and courteous. The car was never left unattended in front of the hotel with the keys in it. If for some reason cars were double parked, he would stand street-side and direct traffic. Location: Great location a couple of blocks from Rue St Paul where most of the \"action\" is. Close enough to walk, yet far enough for a good night's quiet sleep while still being in Old Montreal. Warning on driving to the hotel. This has nothing to do with Hotel Siecle, and everything to do with Old Montreal: Old Montreal is full of one-way streets. They do not alternate direction. This is not laid out with a semblance of logic like Manhattan or Philly. Rue St. Jacques (the street the hotel is located on) is a one way heading toward the hotel from RT 20. Suddenly the street becomes a one way going in the opposite direction. Turn left!!! If you turn right you will end up on another highway going gawd knows where. This is only your first obstacle. Between the one ways that don't alternate direction, horrid street signs and road construction, it took us a min of 1-1/2 hours to find the hotel in a 6 block radius every time we tried to get back to it. Many of the street signs are posted on buildings (not on a corner like in the US) and nearly impossible to see at night. Rue St. Jacques had no sign anywhere (that we could find) on the corner we need to turn on to find the hotel. All the street signs in Old Montreal are in small decorative French script that adds to the frustration. Some traffic lights were really odd. For example; the red light is lit solid, while the green light flashes. No arrows. I have no clue what this signifies. Bottom line; get a really good detailed map and several sets of directions before you go. With a good detailed map, navigating old Montreal would have much easier for us. Summary: If you can find it, Hotel Siecle is a great place to stay.", "Date": "August 14, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "LHotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155032-d254348-Reviews-LHotel-Montreal_Quebec.html", "Price": "$183 - $263*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">262 St Jacques West</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Montreal</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Quebec</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">H2Y 1N1</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "254348", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c8/8d/c88df1308403516010f49a5992d908aa8large.jpg"}}
