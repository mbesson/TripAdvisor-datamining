However, this one time was horrible! Going to a concert, so wanted a close-by motel, but never again! The lobby stinks, the room stinks. Cockroach in the bathtub. Dirty bathroom door. Beds a joke, so hard & uncomfortable! Flat, not fitted sheets, you know how they come undone the first time you turn over! Light bulbs missing. Stains on carpet and one chair (broken too). T.V. channels didn't work. Curtain broken. Desk clerk didn't mention \"free breakfast\", but by morning I would not have trusted the cleanliness of that either! UGH UGH.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE\u201d", "Author": "Meg_baca512", "ReviewID": "UR126408808", "Content": "They don't care about customer service at all! Our flight was delayed so we didn't land until around midnight. Called the hotel and they said they would come pick us up. An hour later and 2 phone calls saying \"we're on our way\" and then just no answer at all we showed up at the hotel. The front door was locked and we had to call and bang on the door for around 15 minutes before the guy sleeping in the back (which we could see the whole time) let us in. What kind of service is that!!!! Rooms are gross and breakfast is only from 7-8. I would never ever ever recommend this hotel!", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOk For 1 Night\u201d", "Author": "Jordan0501", "ReviewID": "UR125717114", "Content": "Neighborhood isn't the greatest, but if you're looking for a place just coming from/or leaving early from PHX then it's a reasonable option.

At $45/night I didn't expect much. My room was clean except for a crusty stain on the floor, and did not smell. Shower was hot with good pressure, and the bed was decent. NOT in a good neighborhood, but I had no car to worry about and I felt safe as long as I did not wander off down the street. I am a single lady travelling alone, and it was fine. No luxuries here, but I saw no bugs and felt that it was a decent value considering the nicer hotels were three times the price.

Very good price for what you get. The room was very clean. The lady at the frontdesk very helpfull. Wireless Internet didn't work all the time but she gave me a cable and that was perfect. Breakfast is standard and included in the price and you can use a computer at the frontdesk if you didn't bring one of your own. The area is not the best one but yeah...what do you expect in Phoenix near the airport. I am a woman who travels alone and I haven't been afraid for a moment. I don't dwell the street at night though, not here. Good hotel to stay an overnight on your way to somewhere else.
