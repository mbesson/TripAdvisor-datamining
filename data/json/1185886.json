We found the staff to be friendly, helpful and very welcoming. DVDs are available to borrow (no charge) which compensates for the lack of English channels. We found Madrid to be a fascinating city; small enough to navigate easily by foot or by Metro, but large enough to find something new to do every day.

Service was fine, and we got into the room in no time. The apartment is near to quite a number of eating establishments, so no worries about getting hungry and finding no place to eat. The place is clean and neat, and while I personally feel it is a little small and cramped for my comfort, it looks new and Wifi is provided. There were two balconies - one from the living \"room\", one from the bedroom. There was a kitchenette provided for boiling water if you need it. The bathroom was on the small side, and every time I take a bath, I must be very careful when turning about, as I might hit the sides of the bath enclosure (cold!), or turn the hot water tap fitting to hottest or coldest. Urgh. Not very good in terms of usability. One thing I would like to highlight also, is that at night, you might be disturbed by the noise from the ground floor, where there are a couple of eating establishments, and you will hear people talking and pretty loud sounds of activities and such. You will also find occasional homeless person sleeping at the walls of the church nearby at night. The nearest metro station we often used was the La Latina Metro Station, about 400 to 500 metres walk (about 5-10 minutes). Overall, slightly above average. Since I could not find above average rating, I chose \"Very Good\". If not for the value, cleanliness and location, I may rate it \"Average\" instead due to the smallish size and irritatingly tight spaced bathroom enclosure.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ansbach, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGood Value\u201d", "Author": "ts6084", "ReviewID": "UR120534275", "Content": "Located in a very good area near many restaurants and bars.

A few days before I arrived the office sent an email with step by step instructions on how to get to the hotel from the airport. It included what lines and stops to use, also had a map with the route from the metro to the hotel. It was a nice and helpful touch. The hot water in the shower was a bit unreliable though. I had to take a freezing cold shower around noon before going out the first day. There was no hot water then and a couple of other times.

I visited Madrid with a friend and we were only there for two days. As such, we needed an apartment that was clean, a reasonable price, and in a good location. Apartamentos Palacio Real was exactly that. We rented a 3-person apartment (apt 3B) since one other girl was supposed to come with us. The Apartment: The apartment was spotless with everything we needed at our fingertips. We arrived and checked in at 11am. When we arrived, the owner was at the front desk to greet us. He gave us our keys, walked us up to our room, and made sure we had everything we needed. We were thrilled with the space and it was exactly what we needed for our trip to Madrid. The bedroom was a normal size with a balcony overlooking the street below. Our bedroom also had a wardrobe, ironing board/iron, and additional linens. The living room had a sofa (turned into a second bed), a TV, a small kitchen table, and kitchen area. The kitchen had a microwave, stove, mini fridge, and sink. The dishes were pretty and plentiful with 6 coffee plates, salad plates, plates, bowls, and glasses. All-around the apartment was well-stocked with paper towels, cleaning materials, wine bottle opener, toaster, coffee maker, strainer, scissors, many pots, dvd player...etc. The rooms were very tastefully decorated with lilac walls, wood floors, and other calming colors. The bathroom was also nice. It was a decent size (for Europe) and all of the appliances were clearly new and well-kept. No rust, mold, etc. that you so often find in older buildings. The shower also had great water pressure. Finally, the wired internet was fast and useful (writing the review from the apt right now!). The Price We purchased this room on booking.com and I still maintain it was the best value we could have asked for. Our budget was approx $40/person/day. With a kitchen and great location, that made it an easy sell. The Location We loved the location, though it may not be for everyone. As others have said, it can be a little loud at night, but we weren't bothered. It is placed in the middle of a safe, lively and non-touristy neighborhood with many sidewalk cafes and tapas restaurants. Also, the apartment is walking distance to almost everything. We only occasionally took the metro and usually walked to our apartment. One note, however, it is a slightly difficult to find location, so be patient with taxi drivers as they try to find it and bring maps with you!", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, good facilities, might be too noisy for some\u201d", "Author": "IainFK", "ReviewID": "UR85199261", "Content": "As mentioned a few times, these apartments are in a great location in the heart of the old town.

Our 2 boys (13 & 14) did fit on the sofa bed but we took a sleeping bag as well for when the bickering got too much! The only down side is that, again as others have mentioned, it is surrounded by some very lively bars, which we would have taken full advantage of about 15 years ago, so this may well be seen as an advantage! The rooms are quite well soundproofed, but I was glad for my earplugs on Saturday and Sunday evening.

Plaza Major is 15 minutes walk away. Calle de Los Mancebos itself is very narrow and parking proved quite difficult; just next to the apartment building there is a small grocery, which was good for buying food and beverages. At our arrival the receptionist was there waiting for us, she was very kind and clearly explained (in Spanish and English) all we had to know about the apartment, she even gave us her mobile number for any emergency. We had an apartment on the 4th floor, which overlooked Calle de Los Mancebos; the apartment comprised a living room with kitchenette, separate bedroom and bathroom. Everything was perfectly clean and in order upon our arrival; in the living room there were TV set and DVD player, the kitchenette had a basic set of tools. The bathroom was a little cramped, but the bedroom was spacious enough. The apartment had air conditioning, which proved useful during the hot september evenings. Given the proximity to bars and restaurants which stay open until very late, there were noises coming from the street that at times disturbed our sleep, but then life in the morning starts again very late, too... We enjoyed very much the freedom having a small home away from home allowed us, and at the end of the day this solution proved a very good one, with overall high value for money.", "Date": "July 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "Correa51", "ReviewID": "UR67951043", "Content": "This apartment was perfectly located within walking distance of several metro stations, great restaurants and shops.
