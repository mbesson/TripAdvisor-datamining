{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Wonderful hotel, great location, good price We stayed for 5 nights at the Dai Ichi Inn Ikebukuro and we loved it. After an eleven hour flight, and hardly any knowledge of the Japanese language, finding the hotel was still a breeze, thanks to its fabulous location: just a few minutes walk from the East Exit of the Ikebukuro station. There\u9225\u6a9a an English-speaking reception and even though we arrived two hours before check-in time, we were allowed to check in. The rooms were spotless and, by Tokyo standards, quite spacious. The bathroom though, was just a small cubicle. There\u9225\u6a9a a small convenience store which can be accessed from the hotel lobby as well as from the street. Very convenient for buying your bottled water and onigiri, amongst other things. Breakfast wasn\u9225\u6a9b included in the room price, but inside the Ikebukuro station there are plenty places to have breakfast. Our absolute favorite was Andersen; delicious creamed buns, sandwiches and cakes, fresh and sumptious.", "Date": "Sep 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR787086588", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Emerald888"}, {"Content": "Good Little Hotel Good hotel for business. There's internet service in the rooms and fairly quiet. If you feel like walking to it, there's a supermarket about 5-7 blocks away if you don't want to spend extra money in restaurants. There's also an underground market with a large array of prepared foods that you can refrigerate. You're near plenty of restaurants and stores if you need anything and near the subway for traveling. I'm not sure of the phone situation since I didn't make any calls. The staff is helpful but unobtrusive.", "Date": "Jun 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR611655071", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "gypsy000"}, {"Content": "perfectly good I booked this hotel cheaply (for Tokyo) through Expedia. The guidebooks made the Ikebukuro sound like a grim, out-of-the-way working class nowhere, but really it's not much different from the better-known areas of town that are equally easy to reach on the same hyper-efficient train lines. The hotel is about 100 feet from the northeast exit of the Ikebukuro station. There are several big department stores with food halls etc right nearby. There's also a convenience store next door that I believe is open 24/7. I had some train noise in my room, but nothing that really inconvenienced me. The room was certainly small but not obnoxiously so, and who cares since I did not intend to spend any time there. Everything was neat and clean and worked fine. Aside from the train there was no noticeable noise. The Expedia rate included a daily trip to the friendly Internet cafe in the same building. I would recommend this hotel to almost anyone visiting Tokyo.", "Date": "Mar 13, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR716342695", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Not bad for the price! Managed to find a reasonably priced package on the website so decided to give it a shot! An oldish hotel, nevertheless the room was surprisingly decent in size and stocked with a good supply of toiletries. Only problem was the strong smell of smoke throughout \u9225?no non smoking rooms! We chose the superior room package including buffet breakfast and 1 hour internet per person which was 11,550 yen a night for two. Had heard that Ikebukuro doesn\u9225\u6a9b offer much in terms of attractions, however we found plenty of things to do and the location especially handy, only minutes from a major station.", "Date": "Dec 10, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR987721214", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Aliup"}, {"Content": "Parfait pour visiter Tokyo   showReview(20648345, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR561734478", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Popscene"}, {"Content": "Lo consiglio   showReview(18530833, 'full');", "Date": "Jul 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR603351274", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Good place and location in TOKYO   showReview(16592617, 'full');", "Date": "May 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR826509950", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Un bon h\u4e48tel   showReview(15573418, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR535299752", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Un bon h\u4e48tel pour ceux qui veulent se d\u8305placer \u813f Tokyo.   showReview(11402923, 'full');", "Date": "Apr 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR611636410", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d307329-r19596580-Dai_Ichi_Inn_Ikebukuro-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "307329", "Price": "$165"}}
