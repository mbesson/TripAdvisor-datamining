A friend and I stayed in Hotel Kybele. Her room had a wonderful city view. My room, with its deep red wallpaper and jewel-toned lanterns on the ceiling, had a quiet, cozy garden view.

We initially had the triple room with a cot which really was challenging to fit our suitcases in but we switched to the family room with 2 balconies which was very spacious and even had a sitting area. We were really surprised at how comfortable the beds were. The showers were adequate but we had quite a few temperature fluctuations. Bring shampoo/conditioner/lotion if you are picky. They have disposers in the shower but the quality is iffy. We never heard any noise from the other guests to the walls must be pretty thick. There are no elevators so if you have issues with steps, better look elsewhere. Breakfast is included in the price and was exactly what you would expect. We ate dinner here twice and were really pleased with the quality of the food and the service. The staff at this hotel really enhanced our stay. They were so friendly and helpful.

It looked so beautiful with its rich colors, lanterns and cozy clutter of antiques. It was even better in person. The decor is the real star here - it is ridiculously charming from the rooms to the lobby to the little hidden library and garden. My room was so beautiful that i didn't want to leave. It was tiny, but perfect. The staff were great. The owner is delightful. Breakfast was wonderful. The location is terrific, right next to the Aya Sofia. It is a very romantic hotel, but even as a solo traveler i appreciated this atmosphere.
