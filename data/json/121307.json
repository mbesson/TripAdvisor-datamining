When I first looked it up I was worried about how far from the Vegas Strip it was but when I got there, I was more than happy. The grounds were great, the food was wonderful, and the rooms were very very nice. The casino was of course really fun and I am told it is where the \"locals go\" so there were plenty of really nice and helpful folks around if you were looking for conversation. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wanted to experience fun, gambling, and time away with friends. I give this hotel a VERY GOOD!! (the only reason I am not giving it a 5 excellent is because the shuttle to the airport only goes every 2 hours and that annoyed me a bit.)", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice and value-priced hotel but far away from the strip\u201d", "Author": "moviemom88", "ReviewID": "UR126706413", "Content": "My family lives in Summerlin, so we stayed here for a wedding instead of the Strip. This hotel is a great bargain and much less than what you would pay on the Strip. If your purpose is to gamble, swim and not venture out of the hotel, this is a good place to stay. The rooms are clean, like any decent chain hotel (Marriotts, Holiday Inn, etc), the restaurants are good and the slot machines are identical. There are definitely a lot of smokers here but the hotel rooms were recently renovated. It is across the street from a large shopping mall too. They run a shuttle to the strip and the airport but you'd probably be better off renting a car. If you purpose is to climb or hike in Red Rocks this is a good location. However...if you want to eat on the Strip or see a show there you are going to need to leave an hour before, not only due to the driving distance, but because of the bad traffic on Las Vegas Blvd (the strip). At these prices it is not reasonable to expect the same level of service as a five-star hotel. Also they do charge extra fees for other amenities but again, consider what you are paying as a baseline.

I am not a very picky person and thought that the bad reviews were just picky people. Our flight came in at 10:30 pm...I knew that the shuttle only ran during the day, but the only way to get to the hotel at that time is a $60 cab ride. We got to the hotel and checked in...this was my first visit to Las Vegas and I didn't realize how smokey Suncoast casino was until I visited other casinos later that weekend. I am a non smoker and the smell was very heavy. The room was nice...very spacious. It was clean. It had a fridge, safe, and nice size TV. Suncoast is a good distance from the strip and the staff is not very helpful on getting your there. We had a helicopter trip to the Grand Cayon scheduled for 8 am. Good luck getting there...no hotel shuttle and most companies will not drive that far out to get you. I was told that I could rent a car...when I checked into that, the company at the hotel was charging double the price that the airport rental companies were charging. I was given a bus map and schedule...but it only showed getting to the strip. When I asked about other routes in town, I was told that they didn't know. Ok, so I could get to the strip, but had no idea how to get to the helicopter company from there...so I got another taxi...$50. When we checked in, we were given certificates...we could get $10 back if we spent $20 in the casino...I spent alot more that $20. The morning we checked out, we tried to get our $10...the manager couldn't get codes he needed until 7am...our flight was 8 am....we couldn't wait...once again...they were sorry.

Short drive to Red Rock Canyon, a must-visit spot every time we're there. Many options for entertainment besides gambling, including a movie theater, bowling alley and swimming pool (closed in the Winter). Deficits: shortage of garbage cans in the room. No soap dish - why do so many places neglect this simple item? No make-up mirror. Big empty space just inside the room entry that seemed to be lacking a piece of furniture for keys, purses, etc. - but the space was bare. The television reception was awful, and the channel selection was slim. Hallway carpets were in desperate need of deep cleaning or replacing. Not glamorous, but serviceable.

However, let me tell you that it is the cleanest property in Las Vegas, partly because it is a smaller property, and the cleaning can be done properly!

Even the 1 bedroom suites are at least 800 square feet; have a full bar with refrigerator; dining room table that sits 8 people; large living room; enormous bedroom, and the biggest bathroom you will ever find in a hotel - all marble - Roman tub - walk in shower (which is so big 8 people could fit in it) and the toilet is compartmented so that you can be in the bathtub or shower and still use the facilities in the suite. Frankly, you don't ever have to leave this hotel - there is an 18 theatre complex inside the hotel; there is a huge bowling alley (which you never hear!) on the second floor; parking is complimentary; there is golf; a swimming pool, great gambling; several restaurants, including an excellent steak house on the top floor; an Italian gem on the casino floor; the requisite buffet (which is excellent, by the way); a cafe; a small restaurant with ice cream and goodies; even a TGI Friday's. It is also across the street from a new Cheesecake Factory and lovely shops. One block away is a great restaurant called \"Mimi's\". This is where all the local \"talent\" live.

The customer I was visiting is located in West LV, so the Suncoast's rates mid-week were fair enough to stay there. For those unaware, the Suncoast is a locals all-inclusive resort hotel/casino at the corner of Rampart and Alta in the fabulous neighborhood of Summerlin, NV. It is practically next door to the Rampart/Casino-JW Marriot and a short drive to the Red Rock Station. The areas surrounding the Suncoast are nothing less than upscale, clean, and very appealing. Just 5 minutes from the hotel on W. Charleston blvd are a Target, PF Chang, Gordon Biersch, Whole Foods, and various other retail outlets and restaurants. I hope to one day live in Summerlin or a neighborhood with its qualities. Anyway, I don't like writing reviews that reiterate what others have said, so I'll add in some bits of information that would be beneficial to anyone visiting the Suncoast in the future. I arrived to LV on a Sunday night, grabbed my rental car, and headed directly to the hotel. Upon arrival, I found that parking was available either at the surface level or in the garage. A previous review here mentioned that the 4th floor of the parking garage is usually empty, and this was the case. Why does this matter? You can park very close to the entry to the elevators, which means less distance to haul your luggage. I was able to get a spot up front all five days I stayed at the Suncoast. I suppose this would be less desirable during the summer, though, as you will be parking your car 4 floors closer to the sun than ground level. The walk from the parking garage to the casino is maybe 3-5 minutes as you have to take an elevator in the parking garage down to the base level, then take a short walk along the \"upstairs level\" to the escalators that lead to the casino near the poker room. The walk here is maybe 75 meters, and there is a moving walkway to use, if needed. When at the casino level, hotel registration will be on the right side of the main casino floor area, past the table games. As I arrived on a Sunday night, I was the only one in line to check in and the service was excellent. You might as well sign up for the Boyd Gaming \"B-Connected\" card while you check-in because it offers some worthwhile discounts. You will receive a small card with details on all the discounts you get at the Suncoast with this players club card. I was booked in a 9th floor room overlooking the golf course. The room itself was fairly large with a wall-mounted flat screen TV (no HD programming, unfortunately), a college dorm refrigerator that seemed to have trouble keeping temperature, and beds that could have used nicer sheets -- they felt a bit scratchy but were comfortable once you settled in. The bathroom was not bad, as it had a sliding door to partition the toilet and bathtub from the dual vanities. The room did include a clothes iron, but it was tethered to the ironing board to deter theft; frankly I can't understand what type of person steals clothes irons from hotel rooms. There is also a medium sized safe that I used to hold my laptop and other items while out on the town. To summarize, the rooms at the Suncoast are standard fare for Vegas plus a few extras (in-room refrigerator, large windows, central heating/cooling). After I got settled into the room, I headed out to the main casino to grab dinner and entertainment. Being a sucker for seafood, I visited the Oyster Bar and had a half dozen oysters and a pan-roast type dish with fish in a tomato based soup. The food and the service were excellent and I didn't have to wait for seating. After dinner I walked around a bit to get a feeling for the layout of the casino, which consists mostly of newer slot machines and various video poker and keno machines. You can always recognize a locals casino for having mostly VP/Keno machines. The table game activity seemed a bit dull, though. I headed up to the 2nd floor where the bowling alley is located. This is where the B-Connected card came in handy as it offers a buy one, get one free game of bowling, which, combined with the Sunday night special of $1 games, got me 2 games of bowling plus a pair of shoes for under $4. The bowling alley is quite nice and is a great way to pass some time while having fun. During the week I visited the different stores within the casino and had no complaints. The TGIF restaurant was quite good, and the little ice cream shop next to the coffee place has a great selection of sweets. Wrapping up the week, I noticed that the Suncoast has a generous check out time of 12 noon, which allows you to sleep in if you're visiting for personal leisure. I didn't charge anything to my room, so I was able to check out over phone on the morning of departure. Now, to justify the title for this review, I am in my mid 20s and I just felt like the vibe at the Suncoast was about 3 decades beyond my age. Most of the casino patrons appeared to be retired, so I wasn't expecting it to be like Planet Hollywood, but things just seemed dull most of the time. Even for business travel, one of the big reasons I enjoy Vegas is the energy in the air, and this was seriously lacking at the Suncoast. The accommodations were perfectly fine and the service was excellent, but it lacked the \"oomph\" that would have brought me back in the future. Would I return to the Suncoast? Only if the rates were very low. Otherwise, I can think of a few other places on the west side that have more energy.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cInexpensive off-strip hotel\u201d", "Author": "kcmBoston", "ReviewID": "UR120179818", "Content": "I stay at Suncoast every time I go to Vegas.

Since we were heading north on US 95, I looked for a hotel on the north side of town and not too far off the highway. I wanted to avoid the traffic and hustle of the strip. The Suncoast has been around for a few years, but it has aged well. The rooms are very spacious, and my wife and I appreciated the double sinks in the bathroom. We stayed here a couple of years ago, and it has not changed much, except the hotel seems to cater to a much older crowd now than I remembered. Most everyone was in the over 50 crowd (myself included). The casino was pretty standard for Vegas. It seems to me that in this day of computerized gaming, casinos have pretty much lost their personality, and one vegas casino is pretty much like any other. I am not a gambler, but the regulars said that the slots at the Suncoast were exceptionally 'tight'. The hotel has about 5 restaurants clustered in one corner of the hotel (obviously sharing a kitchen), along with the usual coffee shop, Buffet and a TGI Fridays. We ate at the Italian themed restaurant. The food was decent, a cut above the big Italian chains, but the wine list was pricey.

Our room was spotless and the beds were comfortable (and I am pretty particular). The water pressure in the shower was good and the maid service was quick and efficient.

Our room had huge floor-to-ceiling windows which looked out onto the first hole of Angel Park mountain golf course - it was fun to watch the bunnies and birds in the early morning and just before dark when they're brave enough to wander out onto the fairways. We also feed chipmunks from our golf cart and saw a coyote. We also enjoyed watching the mowers out with their headlights on, mowing the fairways before sun up. There was no detectable odor of cigarette smoke in the casino, hallways or on our non-smoking floor. The carpets and furniture all appeared to be in very good shape and everything was clean and well attended to - no dish trays left in the hall, etc. Even though the temps were in the 105 - 108 range, we played golf two mornings next door at Angel Park. Their customer service is awesome - they pick you up right at the hotel and let us store our clubs their overnight. The shuttle bus driver told us that they have had to cut back on their shuttle service and no longer pick up or drop off at the Tropicana - they only go back and forth to the airport now. We had a delightful stay, never venturing away from the hotel on this trip. We are looking forward to our next trip, even though the gambling gods did not smile upon us this time.

The room was 500 square feet, with a separate area for toilet and shower. The shower pressure was nice and strong and the hot water was abundant. There was never any trace of cigarette smoke and we did not notice any overwhelming odor of smoke at any time in the casino, either. When we stepped out of the elevator on the 5th floor, I saw a pretty woman who I recognized as Sparkysmom from her TA avatar \u2013 I was delighted to find out that it was indeed, Jewel from Michigan, who was at the Suncoast with her husband and son for a few days. I had been reading her posts on TA and knew that she was going to be there. We had a chance later on in the week to spend some time (while I played video keno) getting to know each other. What a nice gal! We played golf at Angel Park (both Mountain and Palms courses) on Monday and Wednesday at a rate of $75 each and found it extremely convenient to utilize their free pick up and delivery by golf cart. For a municipal course, Angel Park has the best customer service that we have ever encountered. We will definitely plan to play their again. The Mountain course was challenging for me, as I think I was in and out of every single trap out there \u2013 my husband shot a nice round in the low 90\u2019s and I shot a 115 (I have a 25 handicap). The Palms course was a little more welcoming and my husband shot an 86 while I carded a 102 \u2013 both of us even got birdies on this round \u2013 this is a rarity for me, I can tell you. We ate dinner in the St. Tropez buffet (mediocre at best with chicken being the predominant dish, probably because it is so inexpensive), Caf\u00e9 Siena (best thing about it was that I had a chance to practice my German by conversing with one of the waitresses, Christine), SC Prime Steakhouse (where we had a problem using our restaurant.com gift certificate, but the meal was great). On Sunday evening, we took the free Suncoast shuttle (dropped us off at the Tropicana) and saw Barry Manilow \u2013 I know many of you might think that this is a concert for old fogies, but quite honestly, this was one of the best concerts we have ever been to. He did not lip synch as he continually updated us with the winners of the Academy Awards, singing \u201cat the Copa, Copa Cabana, Natalie Portman won for Black Swan \u2013 I hated that movie\u201d\u2026\u2026he didn\u2019t even miss a beat. We found out later by reading her trip report that the nice couple we sat next to was no other than Warmwinds! What a small world!!!! Tuesday was a trip via taxi to downtown. I had hoped my luck would change by visiting the Golden Nugget and 4 Queens \u2013 I was wrong and bad gambling luck followed me throughout my entire trip. It seems like I never saw even 1 hand pay and did not hear the usual hooting and hollering coming from the tables. We left for home on Thursday morning, making it as far as Albuquerque, where we stayed at Sandia Resort and Casino \u2013 the bed here was so badly worn down that I ended up sleeping on the floor. I advised the front desk of the problem upon checkout and they did not offer to make any adjustments to our bill. Sandia\u2019s rooms are very nice, but their beds have consistently been a problem for me. The best thing about Sandia is that they have wonderful, large, fluffy bath towels. We drove home Friday morning and hit a bad snowstorm about 100 miles from home. There were many accidents and slide offs along the interstate, but we arrived safe and sound and are looking forward to our next trip to Las Vegas. Maybe we\u2019ll fly next time.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cCustomer Service was Excellent\u201d", "Author": "Bridget92", "ReviewID": "UR97812837", "Content": "The Suncoast is an excellent Hote/Casino in the best neighborhood in Las Vegas.

Ironing board also in room (closet). There was a mirror upon entering the room. In addition, the hotel delivers USA today newspaper to each room everyday. The casino had all of the games you could want, so no need to go elsewhere for gambling. I enjoyed eating at the Bagel Cafe. They had delicious bagels (asiago) and deli-style sandwiches. Near the bowling alley, there is a business center and two internet computers. I used the computer to print up my boarding pass. There is a fee for the computer. The fee depends on how long you use the internet. Parking is free and the parking garage is easy to navigate. There is a shopping center close to the hotel and restaurants, including fast food like McDonald's and The Cheesecake Factory. It takes about 30-40 minutes to get to the strip from The Suncoast. One negative thing I can say about the hotel is that they didn't have The Weather Channel on the t.v. In fact, not too many channels to choose from. I wasn't in the room much, but I did want to see the local weather. I would stay at The Suncoast again. I would recommend anyone who stays at The Suncoast to have a car.

Bathroom was very spacious as well, with a divider between the sink and the tub & toilet. -Loved the cafe with $9 prime ribs and $12 porterhouse steak.

The room itself was clean and very spacious and the bathroom large and divided into two \"rooms\" one for the bathtub and toilet and the other (entrance) with two sinks. The room was facing the roof of part of the hotel which had air conditioners on it, this led to a horrible noise which made it very hard to sleep at night. In addition the water pressure in the room was almost non existent. At first when we asked to change rooms we were told there was nothing possible, only after going to a different receptionist the next night were we given an upgrade to a different room (room 757). This new room was much better being quiet and the water pressure while being very bad was better than the first room. The room had an LCD tv, a safe large enough for a laptop and a fridge. The hotel itself is off strip, about 20 minutes away (depending on traffic). There is a resort fee of 5$ which is mandatory (although you can decide not to get a newspaper and get 75 cents back).

I booked based upon reviews for the cleanliness and can't say I was terribly disappointed though I did find used dental floss on the bathroom floor upon check-in. Also found a purple ponytail holder on the carpet on the second day - not sure where that came from, certainly not mine. Another reason for booking was the complimentary airport shuttle - this proved to be a disaster. The number for making the shuttle reservation listed on the Suncoast web site gets you to someone who doesn't know about the shuttle. My suggestion would be to send the caller to a recording giving very specific and explicit instructions of where to find the shuttle. We waited over two hours and ended up renting a car thanks to really lousy instructions on the part of the person on the phone at Suncoast not giving a specific exit door at McCarran to look for the shuttle. Fortunately the trip got much better from this point!!! Loved the spacious room with the floor-to-ceiling windows, the beautiful view, separate \"living room\" with excellent lighting for reading, the granite countertops and double sinks in bathroom, separate toilet/shower, refrigerator in the room, flat screen television (though very limited channels to choose from) and housekeeping was invisible yet met all of my requests for an extra towel or toiletry items. The purpose of the trip was a Thanksgiving getaway with the focus off casinos and chowing down. We wanted to do some sightseeing and we did - Hoover Dam, Red Rock Canyon & Gift of Lights holiday light display at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. We also wanted to just chill and have fun so Suncoast was perfect with the on-site movie theater and bowling. I really appreciated the fact the location is in a clean and quiet area (Summerlin) and I absolutely recommend this to anyone who is turned off by the sleazy/seedy Strip hotels. Having stayed on the Strip before I get annoyed at having people constantly trying to divert me from my vacation right in the hotel where I am staying - the sales team disguised as an information or concierge desk, where you don't dare appear the slightest bit lost or confused or you will find yourself at the mercy of salespeople trying to shove you into a timeshare or lure you with \"free\" show tickets. We totally avoided the Strip this trip and didn't miss it one bit. No \"pornslappers\" in Summerlin (slimy-looking people handing out cards for \"companionship\" from gauntlet-like lines all along the Strip; so named for the snapping sound they make trying to slap their porn cards into your hands...)!!! I also appreciated the soundproofing that must have taken place when Suncoast was built - the rooms are very quiet and I am a light sleeper. One evening I returned to my room and saw there were two (maybe more) guys in the next room and one was thoroughly intoxicated and I thought, \"Great, so much for getting any sleep tonight!\" but was wrong - not a sound from the next room did I hear. Slots are tight thought the casino is full of a local \"after-work\" crowd each day. The TGI Fridays had \"happy hour\" specials but managed to have such slow service that we were charged full-price by the time it was said and done. We ate there our first night. I don't recommend this restaurant - go elsewhere. We had Thanksgiving Buffet here and it was good and reasonably priced. Other than that we ate off-site or brought food back with us, there is a Von's supermarket close by in Boca Plaza so we went there the first morning and loaded up on bottled water, deli food for our outdoor/hiking trips, etc... Found out upon checkout that the adjacent golf course is public and has a walking trail that is accessible from Suncoast - plan to utilize that on the next trip. Red Rock Canyon was my favorite part of the trip - very close to Suncoast. There is a turnout before RRC called Red Spring with nice restrooms, covered picnic area, grills and an informative walking path - totally FREE, so be sure to stop here and bring some deli food. a picnic basket or meat for the grill. Hoover Dam was impressive and glad I went. We stopped at Railroad Pass Hotel & Casino in Henderson and enjoyed great food (prime rib or ribeye dinner w/ all the extras) for well under $10 per person. They also has strawberry shortcake for just a buck but we were too full for dessert so didn't try that. Food was great and friendly servers. The day we went to Hoover Dam we had actually planned to drive around Lake Mead. We took Lake Mead Blvd. out of Las Vegas and we were very disappointed that the landscape as far as the eyes could see was littered with broken glass. When we got to the Lake Mead entrance station we commented on all of the broken glass and we were basically told it's a pretty unsavory area, especially at night. We never really got to see Lake Mead, just the Boulder Basin area that wasn't that pretty, then dropped down to see Hoover Dam, then through Boulder City to Railroad Pass then back to Suncoast. Next trip I will do it differently - go North on I-15 to 169, then see the Valley of Fire, Lake Mead, and then exit via 564/Lake Mead Parkway.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Forks, North Dakota", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best places to stay away from the strip and downtown Las Vegas\u201d", "Author": "pvanyo", "ReviewID": "UR88222267", "Content": "Our stay at the Suncoast was wonderful.

We were not coming to Vegas to gamble or enjoy this hotel for the casino purposes; we used it meerly for accommodations. The regular rooms are a good size well over 400 sq. feet and a good price for Vegas. This hotel/casino is off the strip and closer to Red Rocks. If you want to go downtown it is a short drive with your rental. Suncoast does provide shuttle service downtown and back as well. We chose this due to our rock climbing event at Red Rocks Redezvous. If you are going hiking, climbing, or in for the outdoor adventure... you may want to check this place out. We loved the size of the room. The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms were a great size (double sink if I remember correctly), the pool was nice, and the staff were very accommodating. The staff even kept a straight face when we would leave every morning walking through the casino packs and gear slung on our backs... only to return filthy and wore out at night! We loved that they treated us just as they would their high limit players. If you are going to gamble... The rating system the casino uses is pretty tight and you will not build up comps quickly. The high limit slots are not quite as expansive or desireable as other places. We liked the poker room, and it seemed to have a good bunch of players all thorough the day. If you stay at this hotel (more than likely) you will run into an older crowd. It is not the place to be and be seen. The shows are good and they do their best to book name acts. If you are looking for a nice, friendly, family, inexpensive place to stay, you would do well to stay here. We had a great view of Red Rocks and a beautiful golf course.

Of course, I don't know if they always offer last-minute bargains, so you should still compare prices. The place is a long way from the strip and downtown. They do have a shuttle, but I opted for a rental car as we had family to visit in the area. The free self-park requires a walk through the casino; they have an inexpensive valet service that we used the final day. I was surprised how self-sufficient the hotel is. It has a bowling alley, movie theater, several dining establishments, coffee house, slots, large sports book, table games, a poker room, pool, spa, and an evening show for (at the time) $25. The restaraunts were all affordable; although the food was nothing to write home about. The service staff were more typical of a roadhouse grill than a polished spot on the strip. They were pleasant but don't expect them to bow to your every whim. Room service pricing was reasonable--not a rip off. I spent one fun weeknight playing 1/2 NL Hold'em, ordering free shots of Patron, and gabbing with a bunch of locals at the table. It was much more casual than the nail-biting poker on the strip.

No, they couldn't meet me at the new room or even meet me half way for that matter. No apologies were given for the inconvenience. If you plan on reading in your room better bring a flashlight. The lights are so dim that it's impossible to read. While you're at it, bring your own pillow too. The pillows are so huge that you almost sleep sitting up. As for a blanket in the room, there aren't any. You have to ask them to bring you one. During my 3 night stay there, there were always room-service trays left in the hall on the floor and most of them had food in them. 24 hours later the same trays were still there. Come on, can't room service go back and pick up the tray? How about housekeeping - can't they pick it up? It was disgusting. The grand finale though was when they left a letter stating that the electricity would be off sometime during the middle of the night. They neglected to also include that the ear peircing fire alarm would also sound off in addition to being without power. Once again, no apology from the hotel and it wasn't an accident either. They knew the alarm was going to go off but neglected to put that in the letter for fear you would find another hotel. The front desk explained it off as it had to be done and there was just no good time to do it. Really? How about any time other than the middle of the night?? I complained to the people at the seminar I attended as they had arranged this hotel. They got the hotel to issue a whopping $15.00 in food vouchers (only good at certain places in the hotel) for the inconvenience. Again there was no letter of apology with the coupon, just the coupon itself in an envelope that I had to retrieve from the front desk. Guess it was again too much trouble to slip under my door. If you didn't have a battery operated alarm clock and needed to get up in the morning, you were in trouble.

We wanted to stay in the Summerlin area because we were attending a friend's party, and our friend did not live too far from the Suncoast. I was a little hesitant to stay at the Suncoast due to some of the previous reviews on Trip Advisor regarding the bad beds & poor pillows. The friend that I was going with and I discussed it and we decided to give the Suncoast a try anyways. I mean, how bad could a bed be, right? A couple of weeks before our trip I called the Suncoast & spoke to the hotel manager regarding my concerns about the hotel's beds. She assured me that the mattresses had all been replaced about 1.5 years ago and that the pillows were fine. After speaking with her, I felt better & decided to stay there. I think the manager must have put a note in my reservation, because when I checked in to the Suncoast I got upgraded to the most amazing 1700 sq foot suite, a Tuscany Suite. This Suite was fabulous - foyer with 1/2 bath, separating a huge living room and a good sized bedroom with absolutely the biggest jacuzzi bathtub I have ever seen in my life! Floor to ceiling windows in all rooms of the suite, a walk in shower big enough for 6 people and a beautiful looking bed. I don't mean to harp on the bed but a good night's sleep is very important to me, and a comfortable mattress & feather (or at least fluffy) pillows are quite necessary. Well, sorry to say, the reviewers were right and I had the 3 worst nights of sleep in any hotel I have ever stayed in. The bed was SO uncomfortable that I woke up every morning with a very sore back. It was so bad that I could have used a chiropractor! The pillows were horrible foam rubber ones and not a feather pillow was to be found in the entire hotel. One would think that especially a suite would have the most comfortable bed imaginable and scads of feather pillows. Sorry folks -not at the Suncoast!! I was also very surprised that the suite didn't offer more \"treats\" such as slippers, bathrobes, upgraded bath amenities, bottled water or anything. During my 3-night stay things that got used (pads of paper, shampoo, etc) were not replaced. My friend stayed in a regular room and the beds & pillows were the same as in the suite. The standard rooms were beautiful - very spacious & comfortable with a couch & coffee table, and a separate double sink area from the shower & toilet area. The staff were very friendly & accommodating, The casino wasn't lucky for me but I just go to have fun & play the penny slots.

Plus, the hotel movie theatre, bowling alley and nice selection of surrounding shopping and restaurants in this upscale area (Summerlin) provided more than what I needed for my 4 day stay. Staff: exceptionally nice. Check in was great. They couldn't give me the king bed I reserved, but they guaranteed the nonsmoking room which was a must. Housekeeping crew were friendly and all the restaurant and shop staff were great. Room: large and spacious, including the huge bathroom. Nice flat screen tv, but limited channel selection. Bed was the most disappointing of all. Mattress caused me to be pretty stiff and pillows were so-so. Room temperature was easily controllable--a huge plus for me. Car/parking: Having a car for this location is essential. I found that parking it in the outside lot (not the parking garage) offered quicker, easier room access. Gaming: Roulette offers 50 cent chips w/$2.00 minimum inside bets. You don't see that in too many places anymore. I hope to stay here again but I wish they'd upgrade their mattresses.", "Date": "May 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cExceptionally quiet rooms\u201d", "Author": "Ready-to-retire59", "ReviewID": "UR15906679", "Content": "We and several couples stayed at the Suncoast Hotel for four nights in mid-April when our son was getting married at the Stratosphere.

she said that's our policy, sorry. let's just say, i was pretty irritated, and then when i asked to speak to a manager she told me there wasn't one on duty, and there wouldn't be until noon of the next day. that meant there was no one on duty for 15 hours that could make any customer service decisions, which i found to be joke! we were so exhuasted, so i just said whatever, give us our room. the room, except for it being the wrong bed, was actually quite nice. it was very roomy, and we had the view of the strip way off in the distance. the bathroom was huge, with a double vanity area, and a gigantic shower, which was big enough for both me and my husband to shower in at the same time. the tv, was a flat screen tv that must have been at leat 50-55 inches, but the channel selection was terrible. we got about 2 espn channels, tbs and tnt, and some local betting channels, that's it!!! no movie channels, weather channel, nothing. i know we're on vacation and weren't expecting to watch alot of tv, but it would have been nice while getting ready for the night, or before bed. the beds, ugh, not very comfortable, and the pillows??? if you stay here you might as well be prepared to have a sore, stiff neck the whole time. the worst pillows i've ever felt. we actually had to go to wallmart to buy pillows, the ones they had were unbearable. the next morning we went to the front desk to find out when they would be able to move us to our king room, and again we were told there was still no manager there, and woldn't be for a few hours. i cannot believe there isn't a manager on duty at all times. who handles serious problems? halfway into our 2nd day there, a manager called our room, and said that he had a king room ready for us. by this point we had unpacked our stuff, and i was so irritated, i didn't want to spend my vacation, unpacking, then packing again, then moving everything on the complete opposite end of the hotel, then unpacking again, i came on vacation to relax. if this is suncoast's policy, does that mean that if people request a non smoking room, then they will put them in a smoking room, if that's all they have available? if that's the case, i would not recomment this hotel to anyone, i find that policy to be ridiculous, and misleading. the casino we found nice, lots of games, fairly clean, always employees, picking up bottles, and cups, and emptying ashtrays at all the slots. there were several food choices, however we only ate at the deli, and the 24 hour coffee shop. we also had coffee every morning at the Seattle's best coffe shop. i would liked to have a coffee machine in my room, like most other hotels, rather than spend $5.00 every morning for a gourmet coffee. the only other thing for the food, is that 3 out of the 4 nights there, after gambling we were hungry. we went to the 24 hour coffee shop the first night, and the service was the worst i've ever had at any restaurant, and i worked in the hospitality industry for 15 years. the waitress had no idea what she was doing, and it wasn't even that crowded. after it taking 1.5 hours for 2 appetizers and an entree to split, we decided we would eat out the remainder of the nights. the last 2 nights there we were really hungry in the early morning hours, and stopped by the same 24 hour restaurant, and asked to have order to go, in a box, because of how slow the service was last time. she told us no, they didn't have any take out silverware. so instead, we ordered room service, which was the same exact menu, but 4x the prices, and they bring you regular silverware. not really sure why they wouldn't just give us a roll of silverware, like they did when they delivered our $30 appetizer meal, ridiculous! we didn't use the pool or the gym, so can't comment on those, but the movies and the bowling alley looked very nice. the gift shop, was quite nice, had everything we needed and both ladies working in there were so nice and helpful. when it came time to check out, it was very easy, did it right on the tv. called down to the bellman and asked for a luggage cart, as we had 4 big bags. he told us it would be over an hour wait, so we had to make 2 trips down ourselves. all in all, the facility was very clean, including had sanitizer units on the walls. the customer service was pretty poor, which to me is a big reason people become repeat customers. not sure if we will stay here again, when we come out to visit our family, who live only 2 miles away. it seemed like the staff could have cared less about all the people who spent our hard earned cash to stay there, and i didn't care for that attitude at all", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bar Harbor, Maine", "Title": "\u201cShort Stay in Vegas\u201d", "Author": "jim738", "ReviewID": "UR15385558", "Content": "On our way to visit Las Vegas relatives and national parks in Utah, we stayed at the Suncoast Casino and Hotel and found that it fit our needs perfectly.

It's very quiet--more like a resort community than a gambling one. Some rooms have views of the Strip in the distance (looks incredible at night), others have view of the golf course and the mountains and Red Rock Canyon (very nice to wake up to). Good breakfast deal: for the price of eggs and bacon in the casual dining restaurant off the casino floor (I forget its name), you can have the breakfast buffet. Many hot, fresh choices that border on brunch but also a very good yoghurt and cereal bar. I can't imagine staying on the Strip.

The hotel is very local and friendly. The dealers are great fun to talk to and check-in is minimal fuss. Loads of free parking but you'll most likely drive to other restaurants nearby for eating. The rooms are quite large too and spacious. Most importantly they were clean. I stayed one night at the Bellagio to see the difference but found that to be smaller and far more expensive. Not impressed at all with that but that's another review.... Pricewise I got something like US$110 per night during the trade show times which is pretty good.

Everything was wonderful. Here is a quick rundown from beginning to end: 1) Check-in on a Sat. afternoon was quick and smooth. One issue is that the registration desk is in the heart of the casino. We parked in a side parking lot(closest to the 95 freeway exit) and had to lug our bag thru the whole casino. I did not see any bellman but then again, we didn't look for one either. 2) All employees we had contact with were very polite. When we used the credit card to check-in, they asked for id. Since we were once a victim of identity theft, we appreciate it more these days. 3) The room we had was quite large, 550 square feet. We had a king-bed. The room had a flat screen tv. Note if you bring kids, the channel choices are pretty much limited to news and sports. We had a table, plenty of outlets, a sofa and the bathroom was huge. It has two sinks and the toilet/shower area has a sliding door to separate it. One little nicety for the wife was that the hairdryer located in the room was more powerful than the standard tiny ones most motel chains have. The view was not important to us but we did have a nice one overlooking a golf course and mountains. Overall, the room was clean, spacious, and the weekend rate of $150(163 with tax) may be high for Vegas but I have paid a lot more for the same or less in or out of Vegas. The only negative I can think of was the lighting. There are just a few tiny lamps so don't lose a contact lense!! 4) We ate breakfast and dinner in the coffee shop, Cafe Siena. The food quality was decent though the time between ordering the food and getting it in front of you seemed slow. Service seemed fine and the timing may just have been due to the kitchen since both meals seemed slow in coming but fortunately, the food was still hot! 5) As my wife plays just slots and I spend my time in the race/sports book, the smallish casino suited our needs just fine. If you like to \"float\" around, this casino may not be the best choice for you. 6) The jacuzzi area was nice and towels are provided. 7) Though I would not say this hotel promotes bringing the kids with you(there are \"warning\" signs posted to tell you if they see a kid, an adult better be attached to them) , there is a movie theatre, bowling area, and ice cream parlor to keep them occupied. The pool is small so maybe not best if you come in the summer and they want to do a lot of splashing/diving. 8) As has been mentioned in previous reviews, this hotel is about 12+ miles from the heart of the strip. I suggest having a car but the hotel does have a shuttle that takes you to a sister property towards the south part of the strip, The Barbary Coast. There is a Marriott hotel next door with a small casino in it called Rampart if you need a variety. It probably is about a 10 minute walk from door-to-door. 9)Check out at the desk was a breeze. You do have the option of checking out via the tv. We enjoyed our stay here and my thoughts are if you don't need the strip or don't mind driving, can accept paying more than Circus Circus rates, and want a good-sized, quiet room, give this place a try.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "andi0527", "ReviewID": "UR6454188", "Content": "My daughter had a swim meet in Las Vegas so we stayed at this hotel since it was close to the pool.

Make sure when you pull in that you go to the lobby, valet service, do not park yourself, we did and ended up dragging our luggage everywhere, until we decided to get back into the van, and park at the east side and still had to drag a little bit. The casino is pretty big, and pretty popular for being so far away from the others. I didn't think the smoke was so bad, I am a non-smoker and it did not bother me that much. The buffet was pretty big, several different stations of food (mexican, seafood, mongolian, chinese, american and italian and a huge desert station) tried some things i have never had before. The flavor of the food average, some even a little bland. We ate there only once. The second place we ate at was the Cafe Sienna and the food is great and they have large portions with fair prices. This is the restaraunt that also does room service. Having kids with us this is the only restaraunt that we ate at.

Bathrooms were huge, seperate room for the toilet and tub. Double sink in the counter room. And a huge 37 inch tv in your living area, you can order movies for 11.00, we didn't though. You have your bowling, arcade and movie theatre if bored with the casino. Bowling prices were fair, and on Wednesdays they had 1.00 draft beer specials.

We didn't try Primos, but highly recommend The Steakhouse at Circus Circus. Yes we know the Hotel Circus Circus is a dump but the restaurant is GREAT. Since the weather was cool we didn't use the pool but it was sparkling clean and the workout room was a reasonable size. Overall I would stay here again and liked it as much as The Venetian with half the price tag. (Travel Now WebSite 84.99 per night!)

( a bargin since I probably saved $100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!) Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try. We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28. Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about. The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds) We booked through trip reservations , paid $44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers. The buffet was wonderful. We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here. This is video poker heaven! We ordered the \"American Casino Guide\"off the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved $15., at the Rampart nex door. We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. $49 for both nights or $59 for newer tower rooms. Another valuable sight is \"Cheapo Las vegas\" , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense. We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive. So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds, decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!

I am writing to warn off trusting readers from believing these raving reviews for Suncoast. I have used Trip Advisor for years; I swear by it, and travel no where without consulting it. But I now feel, in retrospect, utterly deceived by these rave reviews for the Suncoast resort. On the strength of them, I booked us in for our wedding anniversary. Ouch! The litany of our woes began: no one came to help us with our bags when we first drove up. Our $240 a night room was very ordinary. (For example, no in-room safe -- a staple in every hotel i've ever stayed at). Dinner service at Primo's was bad, bad, bad; and took forever for us to be waited on, despite a half-empty restaurant; food was tasteless. Slot machines give paper tickets, no coins drop when you win (a trend in Las Vegas I wasn't aware of). Since there was no in-room safe; the next morning I tried to leave my laptop with personnel inside the security cage; they said they had no boxes to rent, nor could they take responsibility for the computer; as I am writing a book and the laptop had files on it I couldn't afford to have anyone read or steal, I was left to lug it around the Strip all day. Incidentally, it took a far longer time to get downtown from the Summerlin area to the Strip, than the reviews said. Decided I'd had enough. went on the Internet to Trip Advisor, learned the Venetian resort had a king luxury suite with sunken living room at $169 a night, or $70 less than the Suncoast. Booked it. Checked out of Suncoast at 7 p.m. and into the Venetian. Three bellmen surrounded our car when we drove up to the Venetian; whisked our bags inside. Gorgeous classical music playing. Breath-taking decor and art along the walk between registration desk and the main hotel. Our room was stunning; beautiful antiques and classy decorations - - and Vivaldi!! In-room safe that easily stored my lap-top. Helpful concierge that stayed on the phone 15 minutes gettting us tickets to a late night show (Jubilee!). Slots produced coins dropping into the tray whenever you won. Just like the old days. (I'm into nostalgia, especially on a fantastic anniversary!) Heaven! I'll go back to the Venetian in a minute. Every resort will appeal to some people. I know there is a (heavy) market for the Suncoast - - to the dismay of the near-by Marriott's. The $52 a night rooms appeal to families, and the gambling tables are inexpensive. I just think that the visitor weighing whether to stay there or not, needs to be told (as I have attempted here) that the overwhelming ''raves\" here for the Suncoast are deceiving. It is a clean, inexpensive large hotel, way out of town.

We were sorry to have to leave but will definitely come back. Be sure to get the Club Card for the slots. Even with a little playing the points add up fast and we used them to get a great free meal. We ate almost all meals at Suncoast and they were all delicious. Don't miss the rasberry iced tea, it's the best in the world. We don't have children but there are services dedicated to them as well.

We usually stay at the JW Marriott which is located right next to the Suncoast but they didn't have rooms available so we thought we'd try the Suncoast. I have to say that we were really impressed all around. The price: We booked online directly through the Suncoast's website. The room rate we got was $59 a night and included breakfast buffet for 2, 2 passes to the pool party, and coupon book with discounts on ice cream, coffe, free popcorn at the movie theatre, bowling, golf coupons and many more. For $59 a night we really wondered about the quality of the room we were going to get. What a surprise! The room: Located on a non-smoking floor, very nice! The rooms are large by Vegas standards. We had a room with 2 double beds - very comfortable by the way , a comfy chair and ottoman, a table with 3 chairs, armoire with TV, and a desk with chair. We were traveling as a family of 4, 2 adults, 2 toddlers. We had plenty of room and never felt cramped. The bathroom is mid sized, with a sliding door that seperates the sink/vanity area from the toilet/shower area. Soaps, shampoos, bath gel, and a hair dryer were availble too. I didn't include an inside picture of the room, if you go to the Suncoast website you'll see exactly what our room looked like, same bedding, decor, etc. It was very nice. The floor to ceiling windows really give the room a nice open feel. We had a great view of the golf course, pool, and the JW from our room. In comparison to the JW rooms, the only difference is that the bathroom is larger. The room itself is actually nicer at the Suncoast and at a 3rd of the price it's a great deal! Service: Excellent - Valets, bell services, room service, pool servers, front desk, security, everyone we came into contact with was exceptionally nice! Food: The prices here for food are excellent, very reasonable! Tried the Mexican restaurant for lunch one day, pretty good food! The bill for 3 adults and 2 toddlers was just over $25 with entrees, and drinks! Prices are great, espcially the lunch specials! We also had ice cream at the ice cream shop, huge sundaes for just $4, got 2 for 1 with the coupon book! Had a few pastries from the coffe place too, very good! Room Service prices are the best i've ever seen. They state that there is a service charge of $2 per person, but we were never charged more than $2 total, even when ordering for a group of 7 down by the pool. Full american breakfast - eggs, bacon, toast, hash browns - $7.95, cereal $2.95, pancakes - 4 of the biggest we've seen, just $4.95. We also had room service by the pool one afternoon - Chicken fingers and fries - enough for 2 to share $8.95, soft drinks $2.00 - and they don't just bring a can or one single cup, they bring a carafe full of soda and ice and a cup for each, you get about 3 full drinks from each. Again, across the way at the JW you'll pay double to triple the price for room service and there is no difference in quality, I think the food at the Suncoast was actually better! Pool: It's not a very big pool, but that's ok because it was never crowded while we were there. One morning we went down at 9am to swim and there were never more than 3 or 4 other people in the pool with us. We stayed down there until 2pm and we're alone half of the time. There's also a seperate jaccuzi up some steps on it's own patio. The first day we arrived the pool was so warm that the kids didn't even want to swim, by the next morning the temp was nice and cool. Casino: SMOKEY!!!! When we initially pulled up to the casino you could smell the smoke as we got out of the car, luckily we either got use to it or the filters started working a little better because it didn't seem so bad by day 2! We don't really gamble, slots here and there, but the casino looked nice, wasn't too crowded, and was a mix of young and old. The resort also has a movie theater, bowling alley, a kids club, and some other restaurants which we didn't try. I would definetly stay here again, my husband and I agreed that the Suncoast is better than the JW in all respects except for the pool (the pool at the JW is fantastic!). Great rooms, good inexpensive food, lots of food choices. The Suncoast is also located near a few shopping centers where you'll find a Cheesecake Factory, Claim Jumper, Mimi's, Chili's, and PF Changs. You'll be about 20-30 minutes to the strip depending on traffic, oh yes there is traffic! It's traffic comporable to LA and Orange County, the freeways are a mess! If anyone tries to get you to use the beltway, ignore them, it's worse than the freeway traffic! I would recommend the Suncoast for families, younger people who aren't party animals, and older folks.
