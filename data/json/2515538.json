We were so glad that we stayed there! The resort in undergoing renovations, and we were honestly a little worried about this when we booked our stay because we thought that it would be noisy and chaotic as a result, but just the opposite was true. We were given a corner room on the fourth floor and it was very quiet and peaceful there. Our room was not one of the renovated rooms, but this didn't matter to us because it was very clean, quiet, and comfortable. We had a full kitchen (with stove, fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, dishes, glasses & silverware), two queen beds, a large changing room area, and bathroom. There is no A/C, but the temperature was very pleasant and it was quite nice to have the windows open. There is also a ceiling fan over the beds and an extra room fan if you need it (we didn't). The hotel offers a continental breakfast on the top floor with both indoor and outdoor seating, and not to mention the beautiful view. Breakfast consisted of bagels (with toppings of cream cheese, peanut butter, butter, or jelly), English muffins, various pastries, fresh fruit (bananas, melons, etc.) vanilla & strawberry yogurt, cereals, granola, hard-boiled eggs, juices, coffee, hot chocolate, and more. Our 11 year-old loved the bagels and hard-boiled eggs. Breakfast items were always fresh and satisfying. Each and every staff member we encountered was friendly, courteous, helpful, and always had smiles on their faces. This applies to everyone from the front desk to the cleaning staff to the valets. We definitely felt welcomed. The hotel offers valet parking for $15 per day, but we did not need to use it because street parking was always available at any time of the day or night. We were able to park right in front of the entrance to the hotel most of the nights we stayed there. The neighborhood is safe and we felt comfortable there. Inn at the Park is in a great location. It is literally across the street from Balboa Park and we walked there in a matter of minutes. You can catch the park trolley near 6th street and you are on your way! The hotel is conveniently close to downtown and is just a few miles from the major attractions (USS Midway, Maritime Museum, Petco Field, lots of restaurants, to name a few). It is also just a few convenient miles away from the San Diego Airport and the various rental car companies. We would definitely stay again at Inn at the Park!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carpinteria, California", "Title": "\u201cCharming hotel but came with some problems\u201d", "Author": "amberLeiv", "ReviewID": "UR127205752", "Content": "I've stayed at this hotel twice, both times I was staying for comic con. The first time I stayed here was July 2010 for a single night. Comic con had just finished but we were looking to spend another night in san diego so we called up this hotel and got a room easily. Our first stay was very nice, got a large room with a king size bed, kitchen/dining area, huge closet and nice sized bathroom. The second time we stayed was July 2011 and this time I booked a year in advance for a king size room. When we arrived we found out they had put us in a room that felt smaller than our first one and had a queen size bed. Now, I had paid for a king size room and was given a queen size room so I went to the front desk and asked if they could give us a king sized room, like we asked for, or compensate us some of the money, since queen sized rooms are listed at lower prices than kings. The woman at the front desk said she had no authority to refund us and that all the rooms were booked and to come back when the manager was there. Well...I was never able to catch up to the manager apparently, as every time I went to the desk the person working had no authority. I found that incredibly irritating...but oh well. With all other matters the staff was very helpful and kind. We were on the first floor which was nice so we didn't have to lug our suitcases up stairs or in the elevator that seemed to keep breaking down. The room was on the smaller side but we got used to it, it did have a kitchen and nice bathroom with a very deep tub. I loved the location with the park right across the street and within walking distance to many attractions and a lot of nice restaurants. The valet was also very friendly and always got our car to us quickly. All in all it is a very nice hotel, very comfortable, nice decor and can make you feel at home. BUT because they were unable to honor my year in advance booking for a king size room and unable to reimburse me I probably won't be coming back. I would recommend the hotel for other people when they're coming at a time of year that isn't as busy as comic con.

However, due to renovations, which we didn't know about because we didn't scrutinize the website, the place is in a mess right now, with sections blocked off, plastic hanging, no \"forgot it\" amenities available and increased noise. All tolerable except for the fact that the second morning of our stay - when we were finally allowed to eat breakfast on the rooftop, we were told that we had to join others at tables for 6 (only 4 were set up) or cram the 3 of us onto a tiny elevated cocktail table. All that would have been tolerable, had they not had all the other tables set up in the beautiful rooptop, stained glass windows etc. restaurant, which they were only allowing people to use part of! I thought it was extremely rude to deny guests a comfortable, private breakfast table when they were already enduring the mess of the re-model. After complaint on my part , we were give 1 nights free valet parking (A $15 value and there is plenty of free parking available on the street). Then they finally gifted us a \"20% off coupon for our next stay\" and only at my insistence gave each in the party a coupon. Also, breakfast service included dirty plates and 1 salt and pepper shaker that had to be shared by the entire room! We did see a newly remodeled room and none of us were big fans of the somewhat kitchy lavendar and silver color theme. They are trying to give a grand old lady of a hotel a makeover that is age inappropriate. The rooms are spacious and its nice to have a table and chairs in the kitchen.

See my posted picture. The bathtub was huge and deep with a rainfall showerhead; the bed was comfortable (small square pillows were not). Our room was right off the elevator and across from the bottom of the (steep) stairs to the morning continental breakfast on the 7th floor, and although there was a party upstairs on the 1st night of our stay, the only time we could hear anything was when the people were leaving down the stairs.

I spend a good part of the day trying to find a good hotel for good value using a plethora of travel site. I ran across this hotel since I filtered valet and parking for less than $30( it seems the norm in SD is having $35-60 a night valet). Even for hotels who have outside parking lots.. So after a long exhausting search I found this place. It seemed like a great place from the reviews I read. Since we were going to be there 4 nights I went to the property website and they actually had a special stay 4 nights and get the 4th one for free. So it came out to about $120 bucks a night, A steal for this area. We got to the hotel and were greeting by a very professional valet and front desk representative. The rooms are very vintage and swanky. We are simple people and don\u2019t need the most lavish of amenities and we actually appreciated the old school feel of the rooms, and bathrooms. The beds were amazing (and huge, I'm 6'3 230 Plus) and after all the running around we did in the city for 4 days we had no problems passing out. We had a king size suite on the second floor facing the valet parking lot. Noise levels at night were fine and we slept with the windows open to let the cool breeze in the room. We complimentary breakfast in the morning is on top of the restaurant with breath taking views of balboa park and you can see clear into the city, airport, and Coronado on a clear day. We utilized this pretty much every morning and the menu'd food was very filling especially for touristy duty. Very good selection for the price. The restaurant bar and lounge is great, Friday and weekend nights they have a Piano playing and someone singing, or someone can take a stab at karaoke. The food was amazing as well. We decided to head here toward the tail end of the trip as we were tired and just wanted to wind down with some wine and good company. I think what we loved the most about the hotel was the location to everything and how quiet it was around the hotel. It was literally no more than a 10 min cab ride to anywhere of interest in the Gaslamp district. We had a rental car but we used cabs more than anything. I think we spend on average 25 bucks roundtrip to get to all the restaurants/ bars etc for the nights we met up with friends etc. Living in Sacramento and frequenting SF/ Bay Area regularly we love cabs especially with parking and the frustrations with that. We loved the Inn At the Park so Much we decided to have the wedding party and close family stay here during the wedding. With the roomy 2 bedrooms suites with kitchenettes we figured this would be a great place for family to stay for 4 days plus since if they decide to not eat out they can cook foods and etc. We also will stay here whenever we come to San Diego. Like I said we have stayed at 5 star hotels, the W's, etc and we don\u2019t always get that feel that they are happy you are here, we feel like cattle get you in and get you out.

The Bad The entire interior of the hotel from the rooms to the rooftop ballroom are very dated and need to be redone The radiator heating system is very noisy at times, as was street noise and noise from the cleaning staff in the hallway. My biggest complaint was our room had an adjoining door to another room and on the second night of our stay guests moved into this room. The lack of privacy between the rooms was very invasive as you could hear every word said by the people in the next room. It was as if they moved into your room.

On first glance you MIGHT think it's very rundown and in need of a little updating. But it grows on you immediately. I will say that there are several areas that could be updated a little but quite frankly, I think if it changed too much it might alter the quaint, comfortable appeal the hotel has now. The service was great, everyone was extremely friendly. The free wireless internet worked really well and I never had any problems. One of the BEST part of our stay was the locale near The Hillcrest area and of course Balboa Park which is literally across the street.

We were more than pleased with the hotel, the staff, and especially the location. A few specifics (and responses to some of the negative reviews I read): The Hotel Itself: A beautifully restored 1920s-era building. The suites are really apartments with lots of space. The building definitely has character--high ceilings, Murphy beds, built-in cabinetry. Our suite even had a grand piano! I felt like we'd walked into Bertie Wooster or Hercule Poirot's apartment. Everything was sparkling clean and well maintained. The only negative for us was noise from the street and the rooftop bar when we had the windows open (and the windows didn't completely block the noise). I'm not sure I would stay here in the summer when it's too warm to keep the windows shut. Food: The continental breakfast was good, although perhaps nothing to write home about. The menu included cereal, English muffins, pastries or banana bread, fruit, coffee, juice, milk, and yogurt. It's definitely fun eating on the rooftop patio overlooking downtown, the bay, and the park. We didn't eat in either of the restaurants, so I can't comment there. (However, one couple we ran into said they'd eaten at Inn at the Park several times during their stay.) Inn at the Park was running a $19.95 early-bird prix fixe menu when we were there. Location: Park Manor is literally across the street from Balboa Park. An easy (and safe) walk to the Zoo and other park attractions--1.5 miles tops. The hotel is also right on the edge of Hillcrest, so there's lots of dining within easy (and, again, safe) walking distance. (Among our favorites: Extraordinary Desserts, Chocolat, and Bread and Cie.) Several days we didn't even use our rental car. Other destinations are a bit farther away and would require a car or the bus, including downtown, the Embarcadero, the beaches, etc. The #120 bus stops a block from the hotel and provides easy access to the Fashion Valley Transit Center, where you can take the green line trolley. That bus or another one will get you downtown. Parking: The parking lot is small, but we never had a problem getting a space, even when we got back late in the evening. The hotel seems to work hard to keep people out who are just there for meals or special events. (Registered guests get a hang tag that forestalls towing.) Also, there is ample unmetered parking nearby. LGBT Issues: Park Manor Suites is proudly gay-friendly, as indicated by the rainbow flag above the entrance. Also, Hillcrest is the center of gay culture in San Diego. If you're easily offended, stay at a different hotel in a different part of town. Having said that, I think you would have to be very easily offended to encounter problems at the hotel and in the neighborhood. We found everyone, gay and straight alike, to be warm and welcoming.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beijing, China", "Title": "\u201cOld Charm by Balboa Park\u201d", "Author": "agumonster", "ReviewID": "UR82844343", "Content": "We stayed two nights at Park Manor and felt very much at home, because the hotel has an old apartment charm - large room with a full kitchen, dining table and amenities.

There was no notification that this was a 'GAY' night and we had to watch males dancing, groping and kissing each other whilst eating which was not the type of entertainment that I expected to see. This is obviously a regular occurrence as a lot of the males were known by 1st name turns by the waiters and the singers.

Management decided to switch to a regular hotel many years ago. This gem of an old-world lodging is not for those requiring cookie-cutter, hermetically-sealed, corporate tiny boxes. It is for anyone who seeks excellent service, quirky charm, fabulous location, wonderful food, and a place to stay that can be a destination in itself. Yes, there is no air conditioning. This is San Diego; open the windows, turn on the silent and efficient ceiling fans, if you need to, and enjoy the fresh air. The steam heat is more than sufficient to warm the rooms if you need heat in the cooler months. My first stay in late Spring '06 revealed a warm room that cooled down in minutes once the windows were opened. I've not been in the same room twice in three more visits over the past three years and my experience was the same each time. My spouse and I were married here in '08 and the other five members of our wedding party all stayed here. Each room is a unique decorating experience with an eclectic blend of vintage or antique furniture including pieces the former owner collected throughout his lifetime and spread throughout the hotel. Our small, intimate wedding dinner was given the same high level of care and attention to detail as the large weddings held in the penthouse the same weekend. The food was exquisite, the service extremely professional, and everything from the flowers to the cake to the complimentary bottle of sparkling cider in our room after the wedding dinner was perfect. (We are non-drinkers, so our preference was honored. Sparkling wine or champagne would be the standard fare, we were told.) My spouse and I returned last spring for a getaway weekend and were pleasantly surprised that the staff remembered our names and greeted us like old friends. I've noticed this do this with all their guests and thus is revealed a high level of training, competence, and professionalism; not always present in either less-pricey or more-pricey corporate travel boxes. Our getaway was spent enjoying some of the wonderful Balboa Park museums and the Hillcrest neighborhood. Hillcrest is also eclectic, welcoming, and full of great restaurants and shops for every taste. Oh, yeah, it's the \"gay\" neighborhood, whatever that means anymore. Walk around, enjoy the park, take in the local color, find cuisine from Afgani to traditional delicatessen, from sushi to down home comfort food, and coffeehouses that aren't cut from the Seattle cloth (although there is indeed a Starbucks if you require homogeneity in your caffeine delivery system). The complimentary breakfast on the rooftop is more than enough to get you started and includes views of the city down to the harbor and over Balboa Park and Hillcrest. Bagels, fresh fruit, cereal, juices, and coffee are among your choices to accompany the bracing dose of fresh air in the morning. The wifi worked perfectly; no drops, delays, or glitches. I teach online courses and was able to accomplish my daily postings, grades, comments, and email without a hitch; access to one school's VPN was flawless, as well. We returned for an anniversary weekend with my maid of honor and her husband this fall. We shared a two bedroom suite. One room had a balcony, one did not, but each room was spacious with a king bed that was very comfortable. The only real challenge came in sharing one bathroom, but reasonable people can always work this out. The bathrooms are small in this hotel, but how much room does one really need? I prefer the spacious living room, bedrooms, and kitchen to a cavernous bathroom, anyway. We have already reserved our suite for next year. At the time of our wedding, I required a cane to walk (post-cycle crash). I had no difficulty getting around and would recommend this hotel to both seniors and people with disabilities. Yes, the building is old. Whatever. But, it is in good repair and is truly unique. It has a history and sense of place that the chain travel boxes will never possess. If you prefer the aromas of outgassing plastics, glues, and other synthetics to fresh air, then stay in a corporate chain hotel and breathe deeply. We prefer the fresh air this old building lets us let in or not, out choice, not some accountant's. The old-school piano bar is a treat. It is not unusual for patrons to join in whether they can sing or not. If you want high polish and glitz, go to Vegas. This is one of many neighborhood bars with all that means. When we were here for our wedding dinner, the pianist/singer stopped by our party to solicit requests which started off her next set. Our response to the pianist's inquiry about special occasions this year was greeted with applause and offers for drinks from the regulars. It was just one more feather in the cap of this very unique, hidden secret of a hotel as hotel lounges or bars are far too often joyless, dreary places. To sum up, the Park Manor retains the ambience and charm that hotels provided in gentler times past; when travel was more arduous than it usually is today and when people routinely lived in hotels. It is a reminder that San Diego's year-round climate has always been an enormous part of its appeal and that we can live quite well without stomping about with enormous carbon footprints. As a place to jump off to the rest of your San Diego adventure, it is unique, welcoming, professional, and very calming.

We wanted to rent a car since we arrived to the hotel and even though we were given the phone number for Enterprise and we called them directly, there was never an offer from the FD to get it for us so we ended up taking taxis on our first day since the car rental company never called us back.

I booked a 2 Queen suite for two adults and two teens. My parents, brother, sister and her family also stayed there in separate rooms. I picked this place because of location, large room size, and the full kitchen. These were all big pluses. LOCATION: The manor is located directly across from the balboa park. We walked to the museums and the zoo. It took about ten to 15 minutes to get to the museums , and another 5 minutes to get to the zoo. The walk was too long for my parents, and they drove. Park Manor Suites is close to great restaurants in the Hillcrest area and also close to downtown--without the downtown prices. ROOM SIZE, FURNISHINGS etc: The suites are over 500 sq feet with lots of drawers and closet space. We really liked the extra space. The one bedrooms are around 750 sq ft. The beds were comfortable, no one in my family had any complaints. There was peeling paint in a couple places in our room. KITCHEN: We had a full kitchen-- gas stove w/ four burners, full size refrigerator freezer, microwave and table w/ three chairs. Everything worked. We also had lot of cupboard space, which was nice. The kitchen is furnished with pots, pans, flatwear and a few utensils. It is fine for preparing simple meals. The manor was built in the 20s, and this shows most in the kitchen. The manor is located about a mile from a big supermarket and a trader joes. BREAKFAST: The breakfast was a typical expanded continental breakfast: 4 types of cold cereal, fruit juices, yogurt, fresh fruit, bagels and cream cheese, instant oatmeal packets, hot chocolate, tea, and coffee,--no eggs or waffle maker. The breakfast room has a great view of the City. PARKING: Parking was included and we were always able to find a spot except for one night when my sister had to park on the street half a block away. We did not stay out late, and were back by 9:00 about everynight. Parking may be more of a problem for late arriving guests. GENERAL COMMENTS: Everyone in our group seemed fairly happy with the rooms. There were a couple complaints: 1) no way to adjust the temperature for personal comfort level because of central heating. 2) You can hear sirens from time to time, but not while we slept. There is a computer room for guests, which my teen liked. I used it to print off boarding passes. The staff was wonderful. Originally, I was not going to stay at the manor because their website shows prices jump up for the week end. Because my sister and I each stayed a week, they charged us the regular nightly rate on the weekend but we needed to book my phone.

Walking into our room was like taking a trip back to my grandma's house with all the antiques, 70's style art on the walls, and an old-fashioned bathroom. We immediately opened all the windows and enjoyed the fantastic San Diego weather. The room is definitely old as others have commented previously, but the subtle nuances of a historic place such as Park Manor Suites draw your eye more than the somewhat shabby carpets! I do enjoy vintage items and perhaps that's what allowed me to cast a not-so-critical view on the entire place. The continental breakfast every morning at the top of the hotel provided ample sustenance and beautiful scenery. I was wowed every time we stepped out to enjoy our bagel, fruit, and coffee! The hotel sits on the edge of Balboa Park and though you can hop on a trolley to take you into the main area of the park, my boyfriend and I prefered to explore by foot and found the walk to be more than doable and the views stunning. Hillcrest, the small neighborhood where the Park Manor is located, is truly a gem of a place. Nice people, great boutique shops, and a seemingly unlimited number of coffee shops (yay!). We felt very much at home. All in all, we very much enjoyed our stay at the Park Manor where the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms quaint and unique, and the location absolutely unbeatable.

The hotel is a mix of good, and not so good so I'll try to give both sides. First, we stayed during a period of warmer than usual October temperature (80 F / 26 C) so the most apparent downside to staying at the hotel was the lack of air conditioning. We were on vacation with friends so we occupied a 2-bedroom suite (which had 2 king beds, a balcony overlooking the park, a queen-sized sofa bed in the living room, a dining room and a kitchen. There were 3 TVs but we never turned them on (too busy). Our friends stayed in a 1-bedroom suite which had similar features but in place of the sofa bed was a standard sofa plus there was a \"murphy' bed (fold out bed, that was stored in a compartment in the wall in the living room. Both our rooms had whisper-quiet ceiling fans that did an excellent job of keeping the rooms at a comfortable temperature during the day. When I went to sleep, however, I turned my ceiling fan off (since the breeze from it was disturbing me in bed). There was a different fan (mounted on a pedestal) that was in the closet that i could have used but I didn't bother. As it turned out, on all three nights, I awakened in the morning with a \"soggy pillow\" (so to speak) as the temperature had risen a little during the night (probably from the heat rising from the lower floors of the building -- we were near the top). I could have plugged in the pedestal fan on subsequent nights but I didn't bother -- so, it's up to you. All in all, it wasn't a huge problem. The only other negatives would be that the baths and kitchens are showing some wear. The room was immaculate but the kitchen cabinet doors were a little warped in places, the grout/caulk in the tub had small areas with a little bit of black on them (as someone involved in property management, I can tell you that it's difficult to remove these types of black marks once they \"set in\"). In addition, there was an occasional rusty spot on some of the old hardware. To me, I didn't consider the room \"dirty\" because of these small stains but i know there are some that would feel differently. The decor was pleasant, if not a little quirky in places. We noticed a couple of prints in one corner of the living room depicting a woman and a goose in a rather unconventional pose. (Don't get me wrong. It wasn't licentious -- just a little strange! I think they called it \"art\" in the 1920s/1930s. Our 2-bedroom suite had large rooms: both bedrooms had king beds. There was a sofa and a couple of wing chairs in the living room and the dining room had a table and 4 chairs. The balcony overlooking the park was small (you could stand maybe 2 people) but it was a lovely view. The kitchen had a stove, microwave and refrigerator. I can''t say enough about how great the service was. We were three friends coming from 3 different cities, arriving at three different times and the hotel was great at recommending appropriate room sizes, getting us oriented, suggesting restaurants, etc. Especially outstanding was Joe at the front desk/reception. There was a business center with a PC that you could use at no charge. The rooftop (7th floor) was a restaurant / meeting room / dual balcony areas where complimentary breakfast was served (great views) as well as lunch (extra charge). There is a Friday night party between 5 pm and 10 pm that is open to the guests as well as the public. The hotel does not advertise the party but it is well-known and has been going on for years. It is mostly attended by gay people in the city but my friends and I (as well as other guests we spoke to) felt perfectly comfortable at the party. It takes place on the northeast patio of the roof as well as in the inside penthouse meeting room so there are spectacular views. My \"alcohol heavy\" mixed drink cost $6 -- a buy. (I'm told that the bartender at the outdoor patio bar pours the stiffer drinks; I guess I got lucky). My friends and I both had rental cars and we had no problem parking in the parking lot (included) even on Friday evening during the party. The parking area is NOT open to the public (in spite of a prior reviewer's allusion to the contrary) but the hotel did explain to us when we checked in that there are not quite enough spaces for all of the rooms but since some people don't have cars it is unlikely that there would not be parking. In any event, except for Friday night, there appeared to be ample parking adjacent to the hotel. The location of the hotel cannot be beat. Literally steps to Balboa Park. There is a free tram that picks up every 15 minutes adjacent to the hotel that stops throughout the massive park. The Hillcrest neighborhood is within walking distance and has plenty of eating and drinking places. Getting to the airport is a snap (I did it a bunch of times, picking up and dropping off my friends). You just drive south on Park to Laurel, turn right and take it to the end. (About 10 minutes) We got to the Wild Animal Park, Pacific Beach and Coronado Island with no difficulty. There is a piano bar and restaurant on the lower level (below the lobby, a tiny bit below street level). We didn't eat there but we heard good things from other guests.

After we smelled the gas, we decided to keep the windows open.

Let me just turn to some other's comments that stick in my mind. The location is fine if one has a car. Naturally it can be reached by taxi. Once there it was possible to walk to a busy area around Sixth and University. From there one could take buses that connect with the city's good transportation system. I must admit I drove to Old Town where I could park free all day, and from there I could take trolleys even to the Mexican border, to Petco ballpark or other areas around the city. If you are unfamiliar with San Diego and driving I would recommend a GPS system will be very helpful in getting around. The complimentary breakfast is very good. I actually went away feeling I had overeaten. There was cereal, juices, fruit, yogurt, cottage cheese, sweet rolls, bagels, English muffins, coffee, milk and other things I have forgotten. The view from the top of the hotel where breakfast is served was very pleasant. If the hotel is rather full then parking at night in the hotel lot can be problematic, but there are many available spots on the streets right around the hotel. The presentation of the food in the restaurant is first rate, and my dinner of prime rib was good, but I somehow felt I was in the hands of a young chef who was trying very hard...

We found the reviews herein to be quite accurate and very informative. Essentially, the hotel is older and is a \"character\" or heritage-style property. If you are seeking modern, sleek accommodations - this is not it. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, however they are a bit dated or \"tired\" and rather old. Think of it as staying at Grandma's for a few days - out of date but comfy and functional! The service is quite reasonable - we never lacked for anything we requested and found the staff all to be pleasant and welcoming. Parking is limited and could be a real challenge in late evening. However, we always found a spot (squeezing in some tight spots the couple times we were back late). They are open about this and the reviews all mention it so take this into account if it's an issue for you. The property is conveniently located, close to downtown, Balboa Park (we walked to the Zoo w/ stroller). Breakfast was fine for us - bagels, pastries, fruit, cereal, juices, coffee/tea, etc. If you were there for weeks it might get boring but we liked it. I've read reviews where people complain (no omlettes etc.) and I simply say - if you want that you end up paying for it so go to the $200 a night places to get your darn omlette station! American travellers tend to be a bit food obsessed anyway, so take those reviews with a grain of salt! It's a functional breakfast and if you need more - you probably ought to think about dieting! This is not meant to insult, rather a commentary on the obscene portion sizes in the States. It's no wonder there is an obesity epedemic!! There is no a/c (we knew that in advance) but it was not an issue at all. The ceiling fan works well enough and it was never an issue the whole week we were there (and I'm a Canadian who struggles iniitally in humid heat!). If you are a conservative American, typical Republican, or \"redneck\" - consider staying elsewhere! This is a gay-friendly property and you will encounter homosexual guests and/or staff. It was totally fine with us (it's not contagious people:), but again, if you have an issue with this don't [--] that nobody warned you! We weren't the only family there either - this hotel is great for budget conscious families who need space and would rather spend $$ on fun than on a fancy hotel. All in all, you get what you pay for - and considering the excessive hotel prices in San Diego , the Park Manor is a great value for the dollar.

Working in the hospitality industry for over ten years I completely understood. Within minutes of arriving and calling, we received a call back letting us know that there was a room available right away. After breakfast with the friends and their kids we checked in... Now the photos online do not do the hotel justice. A hotel built nearly 100yrs ago was dilapidated apartment building transformed into a kitschy, luxurious and affordable hotel during the 70's. The sturdy brick building eased my west coast fears of earthquakes. The interior was very beautiful without being over done like most resorts/hotels. The fact that the hotel featured real antiques and not the cheesy replicas I've seen in plast-disney Orlando really provided a sense of class to this hotel. The staff in the tiny front desk was very courteous and helpful, providing us with ample information regarding the hotel's amenities and sites. Once we were in our room it felt like I was in an old apartment, which believe it or not made it homier. Granted, some of the decor could've been a little more updated, but this whole look was a nice change to the major chains I had been accustomed to. The kitchenette was a nice feature of which we would've gladly taken advantage of a little more than we did if we had stayed longer. One thing that did scare me when booking was the lack of a/c in the room - turns out it wasn't even needed! The San Diego weather was beyond perfect, windows open and the ceiling fan set on low was all that we needed! The room was plenty big, the closet was massive and the bathroom was a great size for two. We sadly never ate in their restaurant or got a chance to check out the live entertainment. We did take advantage of the FREE breakfast on the rooftop taking in the views of the bay, balboa parks and the mountains behind the park. The price for the room was very fair; the price for the views, convenience of walking everywhere and short rides to the major interstates and airport was beyond a steal.

Free breakfast every morning at the rooftop restaurant was fresh and offered the best coffee we had anywhere in town. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for accommodations with more character than you'll find at the big chain hotels.

As I admired the complete and full sized kitchen and the kids sunk in to the comfortable furniture, my husband marveled at the fact that the windows actually opened.

Some reviewers have complained about the plumbing and such but, heck, it's a hundred years old! Personally, we loved the old world ambiance and imagined the buggies pulling up in front and unloading their steamer trunks. Aspects that might seem distasteful or in disrepair in newer hotels gave this hotel it's character. We easily cooked all our meals in the kitchen, saving big bucks for a family. The maid service was impecable, even putting away our dishes that were left out to dry and arranging our children's stuffed animals on their beds. The location was perfect for Sea World and the Zoo.

Before I left Austin, Texas, I called the hotel to make certain that the accommodations were going to suit my needs. Kelli, an extremely amiable front desk clerk, listened very carefully to my requests, and I was later shocked to find that my expectations were far below the wonderful reality that she had waiting for me. Built in the mid-1920s, the hotel is adjacent to Balboa Park, and reflects the elegance of the era. Great care has been taken to preserve the art-deco European style of the establishment, and it abounds with large gilt mirrors, marble floors, bronze statues, and period furniture. The roof has a restaurant, whose atmosphere is reminiscent of the Queen Mary, with cuisine to rival. The entire rooftop, surrounded with twinkling lights, is dedicated to the gourmand, and has a happy hour every Friday night, whose local and tourist/sightseeing clientele understands the meaning of fun, food, acceptable behaviour, and value. The rooftop restaurant provides a charming Continental breakfast every morning for guests, and ground floor has a pub open daily to the public. My room looked like something from a 'Travel Europe in Style' guide book. I had chosen a mini-suite with two double beds; but was amazed to find - in addition to a bed-sitting room - a full kitchen, a dining room, and a dressing room with a gigantic mirrored double-closet, dresser, dressing table, and an ironing board with iron. I must have taken 6 baths in 2 days in the oversized bathroom tub, soaking up to my neck in total relaxation. (And believe me, after the stress of the trip there and the impending functions I had to attend, I needed it!) Dwight, the front-desk guest services manager, was attuned to my every need, and greeted me by name, as does the rest of the staff with all guests. The perfect man for the position he holds, he personally insured that every possible accommodation be made to make my stay at the Park Manor as comfortable as possible. Area maps are available at the front desk, in order to provide guests with directions to personal rendezvous' or to nearby services. My reason for being in San Diego was to attend my son's wedding at the Japanese Friendship Garden in Balboa Park; but, to be honest, the Park Manor has given me reason to go back to San Diego... period. My friends and relatives, after seeing my hotel and my room, were horrified to think about what they were enduring at more well-know establishments (and paying more) when they could have stayed at the Park Manor, dined, relaxed, slept in luxurious comfort, AND have paid considerably less. I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a truly unique experience. This is not a cookie-cutter 'knock-off,' nor is it a 'trendy-for-now' establishment. After traveling all around the world (literally), I can honestly say that the Park Manor is the 'real thing', making a statement of its own, and making it well. While you're there, take advantage of a moment or two to chat with Kelli and Dwight, two of the most delightful hotel service people that I have ever met. J.C.

I booked the Midweek Getaway through the \"Specials\" link on the hotel's website for $149 plus tax which incluses a Studio Suite, wine or champagne upon arrival in your room and $40 towards dinner at the hotel's restaurant downstairs. Champagne tasted cheap and the hotel restaurant is maybe a 2 or 3-star establishment with 4-star prices. I arrived very early (8am). The hotel staff was happy to hold my luggage and provide me with a parking permit for their lot while I spent the day in Balboa Park and the Zoo. I got lucky and there was one open space in the small lot when I arrived. Still, free parking is a great plus considering downtown hotels charge $20-30 a day to park. Check-in is the standard 3pm, but I was given a bit of a cold shoulder when I returned at 2:30pm and asked for my room. I was told it was still too early, but they gave me the room anyway. Not exactly sure why, but I was given a two-bedroom suite on the 6th floor instead of the studio I had booked. This was a pleasant surprise. I had asked for a room overlooking 6th Avenue since there is construction on the south side of the property near the parking lot, but was told all rooms had already been assigned. My room overlooked the parking lot and Spruce Street. Construction was not an issue since we checked in as the crew was ending for the day and left early the next morning. Anyway, the room was a huge, corner unit. Everything was very clean, and although there is no A/C in the hotel rooms, the corner gave great cross-ventilation so sleeping with the windows open with ocean breeze was excellent. The plumbing is a bit whacky; my toilet either did not flush or it flushed 5-10 times on its own. Water pressure in the shower is fine. Not much shelf or counter space for toiletries so we had to use a table that was just outside the bathroom door. The kitchen was a nice perk, but we only used the fridge. I suppose if we had stayed longer, we would have cooked meals to save money. My major complaint was that in the hallway near our room there were 5 or 6 drop cloths that remained there just until we were bringing our bags down to check-out. There was no one working in the hallway that I had noticed. Before you leave, be sure to go up to the 7th floor and have your free continental breakfast. The breakfast is nothing special (bagels, cereal, fruit, juice, coffee) but the view is spectacular. If I had the option, I would give this place a 3.5, but it just does not make it to a 4. The property has a lot of character and does not appear to need major renovations, but as you walk throughout the building and your room, you can see that whomever was in charge of painting did not pay much attention to detail. The windows do not move easily and the reception on both the TVs in our room was horrible. The rooms did have a bit of a musty odor, and if you are a neat freak, you may get a bit of a dirty feeling. If you lack patience and do not have your bags with you, take the stairs as an average wait for the elevator was at least 2 - 4 minutes. This is not a Hilton, nor did I expect one. For what I paid and for what I was given, I would recommend this hotel, especially if the Zoo is on your itinerary. If downtown and the marina is more your cup of tea, I suggest you find a hotel in that area since you are looking at a 15 minute cab ride (or take the 25 downtown the the Orange or Blue Trolley lines). P.S. Normally I would not address an issue like this since, to me, it is a moot point: Hillcrest is apparently a gay community. Some have complained about this hotel and its relationship with that community. Personally, I have no idea what they are talking about. We walked around extensively: in the Park, on University Avenue and all the way down 6th to the hotel. Now, perhaps because I have lived in the NY metro area my entire life I have become desensitized to things like this, but even so, there was nothing over the top going on in the hotel or the immediate area.

But the areas in which the Park Manor falls short is undoubtedly the overall cleanliness of the hotel. Carpets are worn and look dirty - not even like most hotels where the carpet is a busy design to avoid looking filthy. The bed linens give off the impression - and later prove to be - uncomfortable and leave you with that \"dirty\" feeling. I couldn't even force myself to sit on the sofa in the room wondering how many people had utilized it, knowing that the covers had probably never been washed. The television in the room was all of 19\" and could only be seen from the bed with a telescope - something not provided by the hotel. I like the idea of the Park Manor.

One woman went out and bought new sheets to put on her bed. In my room, the shower was stained, the enamel was wearing off the toilet, and the sofa made me itch. In another room the refrigerator didn't work and there was a dead bug inside; there was a hole in someone else's wall.
