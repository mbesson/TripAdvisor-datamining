Shortly after we called, we received a confirmation of our reservation. We thougt all was well until the day before we left on our road trip, when they called and cancelled our reservation!. We were told that people who were to have left the hotel were not leaving so they had no room for us. At the last minute we searched around for a decent place and ended up paying in excess of $700 more....not to even mention the stress of the whole ordeal.

This is the hell we got. We stayed for 4 days and in those days we saw no pool maintenance being done. In fact, the pool was never open during the hours posted, hotel staff had to be reminded to unlock the pool. There was bird crap all over the edge of the pool so not sanitary at all. There were 3 of us in our room & we had to ask not only daily but at least 3 times a day before new towels were provided. The rooms have indoor/outdoor carpeting, probably because they turn a hose on the rooms after Spring Break. Room smelled horribly of mold & old vomit, had to use Febreeze to make it liveable. Walls, headboards & doors had either fist holes punched in them or water stains. If you happen to leave the parking area (about 12 spaces) and come back to a full lot, your \"additional parking\" is 2 blocks away. If you need ice, you have to go to the hotel down the street. Nice location, but in a word, this place is a complete DUMP staffed by bored, incompetent layabouts.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Springs, Florida", "Title": "\u201cWould not ever stay here again, very unclean.\u201d", "Author": "dgtruesdell", "ReviewID": "UR63332574", "Content": "Room was large however very musty smelling.

In the three days we were there I did not once see any pool cleaning being done at all. I am very suprised the health inspector has let it stay open. When i arrive they had a sign indicationg guest parking $3 per day. I inquired about this and was told it did not apply to registered guest because it was included in our room rate. Upon check out I was still charged the extra for parking.

We were also celebrating my 50th Birthday. The young lady at the front desk was most pleasant and helpful. After checking the room out, we found only 4 towels for the 3 of us. The odor in the room was completely over powering. We sprayed the place with Lysol. The location is great. We walked around until the odor was minimized. Around 6pm I started filling the Jacuzzi with water and found that the pressure was extremely low. I went to the desk, and the gentleman said there was nothing he could do about it. I also noticed that the water was just slightly warm. The water ran from 6pm to 10 pm before the Jacuzzi became full. The panels on the floor in the Jacuzzi room were loose when you stepped on them. The door to Jacuzzi room had a big hole in it. My wife was so disarrayed by now she refused to remove her clothes, and went to bed to find blood on the bed covers. She came apart, and spent the night sleepless and angry. The location was great for beach access, but beyond that, it was a horrible experience for all of us. We will never do this again.

Saturday presented a different view, due to more people checking in, we were on second floor, and people above us sounded like they were running and jumping all day long,,,this lasted until 4 in the morning, when we went to the office to see if we could maybe move rooms,,it was closed and dark, so no assistant there, and also the rooms look clean, but dont walk on the carpet in white socks,, or they will no longer be white.

(Bad choice!) We were going spur of the moment & just tried to pick a \"mid priced\" hotel. We arrived at 2:30 and was told that they had one ground floor, ocean front view room, but it wouldn't be ready for another hour. When we were finally able to check in, the room size was good, but after an hour, the air conditioning still wasn't working. We stayed outside to enjoy the view, but it was obstructed by very unkempt landscaping. Totally blocking our \"view\". I never did find an ice bucket in the room, and the fridge wouldn't get cold either. So, off to the office. He looked very bothered by the fact that we asked him to come look at our ac unit, but reluctantly did. His answer was to change rooms. When we packed up, walked completely around the hotel and upstairs, to our new room, we were shocked at how much smaller it was. We were suprised to find a better ocean view, but could never get that door to close right, or unlock with the key. (My room key never worked, in either door!) The bathroom was VERY small and was covered with ants. This time the ac worked well, but still no ice bucket, and I never did find an ice machine! I've never been to a hotel that didn't have ice?!? On our way to the 7-11 to BUY ice, we passed a family of 4, from up north that had booked the hotel for a week, online. When they went to check in, they were told that their reservations had gotten mixed up, and that they could have one room for a night or two, but would have to pack up & move to another room mid stay. Needless to say, they were NOT happy! Basically, the place was OLD & rundown, and totally not worth the price. (My boyfriend still won't tell me what he paid, cause he knows that I will be IRATE!

There is SOOO MUCH that needs repairing that i'm not sure HOW or WHY this motel is still operational. Lets review a few: 1) Doors to room do not fully close properly! 2)Musky/smokey odors! 3) Holes and Scratches on Doors in rooms! 4) ANTS!!!! OMG! in Bathroom,refridge, microwave, beds, pillows, etc... 5) Paint peeling off ceilings, walls, window ceels! 6) Coffee Pot and maker DIRTY! 7) wash cloths were FILTHY!!! looked like someone washed their car with them. NOT CLEAN LOOKING! and ONLY ONE Towel per person! 8) We were surprised about having to pay $3.00 just to park in the parking lot where we were staying! OMG I HAVE NEVER! There wasnt even security to watch our car! 9) No hairdryers, only ONE mirror and that was in the bathroom. 10) Fan in Bathroom didn't work and looked liked as if it did it would burn down the place. Decor in Bathroom was late 50's era with pink and black with broken shower tiles. 11) Pool area wasn't nothin like the picture. 12) carpet really needs replacing. 13) Pretty terrible\"carvings\" on the walls in the room and bathrooms and the closet and the window ceels. 14) someone \"TAPED\" the light switch to the wall and someone \"removed\" the tape so it was just hanging in the bathroom. 15) The Motel just looked completely RUN DOWN and seriously needs painting and brought up to code. 16) the Delapadated motel or \"cat/bird/hobo/etc\" view from the poolside rooms is HORRIBLE! 17) No ice machine or buckets. 18) someone removed the small kitchenette and was just a hole in the wall in the room. 19) Slick walkways and steps which are just a liability waiting to happen. It was rainy and i almost slid down. 20) Hobos and Hookers hang out in the parking lot. 21) Broken AC Units left out front and not disposed of. 22) DO NOT BELIEVE THE PICS OF THIS MOTEL BY THE WEB PICS!!! VERY VERY VERY MISSLEADING!!! Good for the value?? NOT!!!!! NEVER AGAIN!! IF the Motel or Hotel is not listed in the AAA Book, we will never book from pics off the website! My husband and I would Like our money back and feel we were totally misslead. We could not cancel once we got there or we would have lost all our money! This is due to their cancelation policy since we prepaid online. If the owers were honest, they would reimburse us. This establishment is owned by a supposedly HUGH Corporation of Daytona????? WOW!

I swear, the woman in the next room was a 'lady of the evening' or a pharmacist (if ya get the idea), with all the traffic going in and out. It was not a safe feeling motel at all. Walking to the beach or to the 7-11 panhandlers are everywhere. I think the front desk guy was stoned when we arrived.
